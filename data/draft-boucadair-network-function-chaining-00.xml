      <t>IP networks rely more and more on the combination of advanced functions (besides the basic routing and forwarding functions). This document defines a solution to enforce Network-Located Function Chaining (NLFC) with minimum requirements on the underlying network. The proposed solution allows for Differentiated Forwarding (DiffForward): packets are classified at the entry point of an NLFC- enabled network, and are then forwarded on a per NLFC map basis.</t>
