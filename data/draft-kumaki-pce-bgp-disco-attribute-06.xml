      <t>Connectivity between customer sites in an IP Virtual Private Network(VPN) supported by BGP/MPLS may be achieved using MPLS TrafficEngineered (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). The paths of these LSPsmust be computed to provide the end-to-end connectivity desired, andthe paths selected may depend upon the VPN being served, and thelocation and reachability of target addresses within customer sites.The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a server that can compute thepaths of TE LSPs in an MPLS network. Where one or more VPNs issupported over a core network, different PCEs may serve computationsfor different VPNs.PCE discovery allows a Path Computation Client (PCC) to determinewhich PCEs are available to service its computation requests.Using an IGP to distribute PCE discovery information for VPN usewould result in the information being needlessly flooded to all corenodes regardless of whether they are aware of the VPN. These nodes donot need to be aware of per-VPN PCE function. This document describeshow BGP can be used to distribute PCE discovery informationspecifically for use in VPN path computation.</t>
