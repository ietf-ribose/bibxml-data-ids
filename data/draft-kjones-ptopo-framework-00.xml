      <t>This memo defines a framework for the collection of physical topology information. Physical topology is defined as the physical interconnection of communication ports between communication devices. The framework allows for topology determination within and across a broad spectrum of devices. It establishes a set of guidelines for topology mechanisms used to distribute and collect topology information, and describes the behavior of a management station required to collect topology information across a potentially large and diverse set of communication devices. A companion memo will provide an experimental portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) which is derived from this framework and allows the management workstation to gather physical topology information from the devices in the network.</t>
