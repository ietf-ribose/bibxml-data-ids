      <t>Internet Traffic has constantly shown the pattern that a verysmall amount of the traffic flows generate a high traffic volumewhile a significant amount of small flows contribute a smallamount of traffic volume. Differentiating such large flow andsmall flow in the packet switched network enables an enhancedtransport method over Equal Cost Multi Paths (ECMP). This draftdescribes the enhanced ECMP transport with the large flowawareness.</t>
