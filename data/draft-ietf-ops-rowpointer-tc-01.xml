      <t>This document defines a textual convention, ReusableRow, similar to the RowStatus and StorageType textual conventions defined in RFC 2579 [7]. Like these two textual conventions, ReusableRow characterizes the conceptual row of which it is a part. It indicates whether, in the course of a cloning activity, the row should be duplicated (with, obviously, a different index value), or simply pointed to by one or more newly cloned objects. This cloning may involve the scripting- based techniques defined under the SNMP Configuration umbrella, but it need not: cloning can also be realized with ordinary SNMP Get and Set operations.</t>
