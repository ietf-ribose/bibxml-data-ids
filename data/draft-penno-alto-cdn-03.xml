      <t>Networking applications can request through the ALTO protocolinformation about the underlying network topology from the ISP orContent Provider (henceforth referred as Provider) point of view. Inother words, information about what a Provider prefers in terms oftraffic optimization -- and a way to distribute it. The ALTO Serviceprovides information such as preferences of network resources withthe goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns whilemaintaining or improving application performance.One of the main use cases of the ALTO Service is its integration withContent Delivery Networks (CDN). The purpose of this draft istwofold: first, to describe how ALTO can be used in existing and newCDNs, both within an ISP and in separate organizational entities fromthe ISP; second, to collect requirements for ALTO usage in CDNs andto provide recommendations into the development of the ALTO protocolfor better support of CDNs.</t>
