      <t>This document describes a solution to engineer paths for IP multicasttraffic in a network, by directing the control messages to setupmulticast trees on engineered paths. This enables the networkoperator to have control over the topology of multicast trees.This proposal partitions the multicast traffic engineering problemsuch that multicast routing protocols do not have to be modified toallocate resources for multicast traffic nor do resource allocationprotocols such as RSVP or CR-LDP have to be able to setup forwardingstates (in this case labels) like multicast routing protocols.Resources are allocated on the same trip that paths are selected andsetup. This prevent the problem of data being forwarded on branchesof the tree where resources have not being allocated yet. Animportant aspect of this proposal is that it enables multicast pathsto be engineered in an aggregatable manner, allowing this solution toscale in the backbone.</t>
