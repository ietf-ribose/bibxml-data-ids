      <t>This document proposes a RELOAD Usage for Distributed ConferencePlatform which can support a lot of meetings simultaneously. Itdesigns a new distributed conference architecture. In thisarchitecture the component called MCS is responsible for the processof media data including audio and video. Some conference UEs whichhave enough bandwidth or other conditions could also undertake partsof media data process. All the MCSs form the reload overlay. Thecapacity and state information of conference UEs is stored in theRELOAD overlay. One or several MCSs will be selected to provide mediaprocess for a meeting and these MCSs process all the transcodingand transmission of audio and video data, and decide which mediaprocess task could be assigned to Conference UEs.</t>
