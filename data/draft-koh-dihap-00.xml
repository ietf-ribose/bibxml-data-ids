      <t>This draft describes a proposed Dynamic Inter Home Agent solution to provide redundancy and load balancing of Home Agents. The proposed solution recommends additional communication between home agents that may be located far apart in terms of network topology but still belonging to or are trusted by the same administrative domains (service providers). While the mobile node is roaming away from its home network, intervening home agents in the path of the bidirectional tunnel between the mobile node and its registered home agent may detect its presence. The intervening home agents that are affiliated to the current home agent of the mobile node then proceed to update it of their availability to serve as home agent for the mobile node.</t>
