      <t>Complexity is a widely used parameter in network design, yet there is no generally accepted definition of the term. Complexity metrics exist in a wide range of research, but most of them address only a particular aspect of a network, for example the complexity of a graph or software. There is a desire to define the complexity of a network as a whole, as deployed today to provide Internet services. This document provides a framework to guide research on the topic of network complexity.</t>
