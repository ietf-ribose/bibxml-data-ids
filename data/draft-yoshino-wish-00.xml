    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a general purpose message framing named WiSH which supports bi-directional message-based communication over byte- stream oriented protocols such as HTTP (in its standard semantics). The WiSH framing is designed to be compatible with WebSocket. You may want to think about WiSH as a binary and bi-directional alternative to the framing defined for the server-sent events [SSE].</t>
