      <t>This document proposes a Per Hop Behavior(PHB) in the context of diffserv. We first propose a labeling procedure for the ingress router that labels packets in a manner that implicitly conveys the packet arrival rate information of each flow to the core router. Coupled with a simple forwarding procedure, this provides a fair allocation of bandwidth. We then propose other labeling procedures that add little computational complexity, but provide weighted fair allocation, minimum bandwidth assurances and support for intra-flow priorities. By appropriately designing the labeling algorithms, this PHB can be used to optimize the performance of a variety of flows.</t>
