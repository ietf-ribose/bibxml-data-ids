    <abstract>
      <t>SIP networks use signaling monitoring tools to debug customer- reported problems and for regression testing if network or client software is upgraded. As networks grow and become interconnected, including connection via transit networks, it becomes impractical to predict the path that SIP signaling will take between clients and, therefore, impractical to monitor SIP signaling end-to-end. This document describes the requirements for adding an indicator to the SIP Protocol Data Unit (PDU) or a SIP message that marks the PDU as a candidate for logging. Such a marking will typically be applied as part of network testing controlled by the network operator and not used in regular client signaling. However, such a marking can be carried end-to-end, including the SIP terminals, even if a session originates and terminates in different networks.</t>
