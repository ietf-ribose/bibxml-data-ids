      <t>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN services to support the needs of new applications, particularly including the applications that are associated with 5G services. An enhanced VPN could be used for transport network slicing in 5G, and will also be of use in more generic scenarios. I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn describes the framework and candidate component technologies for providing enhanced VPN services. This document describes the scalability considerations in the control plane and data plane to enable VPN+ services, some optimization mechanisms are also described.</t>
