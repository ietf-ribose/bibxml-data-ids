      <t>This document defines a set of extensions for the Extensible Peer Protocol (XPP) required for creating a P2PSIP overlay network based on the CAN distributed hash table algorithm. It specifies how peers and clients must behave in order to maintain the overlay and use it for the establishment of multimedia communication sessions. To limit the overhead due to maintenance operations and to allow the adoption of security policies for preventing malicious nodes to damage the overlay, joins are always initiated and controlled by existing peers (hence the passive in PCAN).</t>
