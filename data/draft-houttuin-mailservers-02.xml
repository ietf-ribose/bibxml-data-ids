      <t>This document defines recommendations to be implemented in mail based servers in the Internet and GO-MHS e-mail communities. The requirements only affect the basic behaviour of servers, i.e. it mainly deals with how header fields are handled. Although there is also a clear need for recommendations in the field of end user requirements, such as command syntaxes for archive servers, automatic distribution list subscription, etc., such issues are considered more suitable to be dealt with in a separate document. It is highly desirable that other e-mail networks connected to the Internet also implement these recommendations.</t>
