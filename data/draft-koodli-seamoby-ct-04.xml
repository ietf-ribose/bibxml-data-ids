      <t>Mobile nodes enhance the performance of their connections across wireless media by establishing various kinds of state (context), in order to use the available bandwidth securely and economically. During handover from one access router to another, a bandwidth-constrained mobile node needs to have state information passed from the previous router to the new one. This document proposes a framework for control structures that enable authorized context transfers. We demonstrate how the proposed framework could be applied during handovers so that the applications running on the mobile node could operate with minimal disruption, by reducing latency and packet losses</t>
