      <t>Mobile nodes enhance the performance of their connectionsacross wireless media by establishing various kinds of state(context), in order to use the available bandwidth securely andeconomically. During handover from one access router to another, abandwidth-constrained mobile node needs to have state informationpassed from the previous router to the new one. This documentproposes a framework for control structures that enable authorizedcontext transfers. We demonstrate how the proposed framework couldbe applied during handovers so that the applications running onthe mobile node could operate with minimal disruption, by reducinglatency and packet losses</t>
