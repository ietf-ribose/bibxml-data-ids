      <t>This text describes evolving networking technology within small "residential home" networks. The goal of this memo is to define the architecture for IPv6-based home networking and the associated principles and considerations. The text highlights the impact of IPv6 on home networking, illustrates topology scenarios, and shows how standard IPv6 mechanisms and addressing can be employed in home networking. The architecture describes the need for specific protocol extensions for certain additional functionality. It is assumed that the IPv6 home network runs as an IPv6-only or dual-stack network, but there are no recommendations in this memo for the IPv4 part of the network.</t>
