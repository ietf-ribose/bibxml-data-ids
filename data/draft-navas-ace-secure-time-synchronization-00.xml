      <t>This documents defines the Lightweight Authenticated Time (LATe) Synchronization Protocol, a secure time synchronization protocol for constrained environments. The messages are encoded using Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and basic security services are provided by CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE). A secure source of time is a base assumption for many other services, including security services. LATe Synchronization protocol enables these time-dependent services to run in the context of a constrained environment.</t>
