      <t>Multi-link transport can offer higher bandwidth and more robust connections. Because of a wide variety of emerged wireless access technologies, a mobile host can potentially have subscriptions and access more than one wireless network simultaneously. This document introduces example applications which use multiple links in a connection simultaneously and illustrates the advantages of multi-link transport. A problem with those applications is that the efficient multi-link transport needs much more knowledge about each link characteristics such as bandwidth, delay, reliability and robustness. This document defines the requirements for efficient and adaptive multi-link transport and also describes the link information that multi-stream senders can require.</t>
