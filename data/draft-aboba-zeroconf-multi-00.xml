      <t>Today, with the rapid rise of home networking, there is an increasing need for simplified mechanisms for IPv4 address allocation within multi- segment networks connected by a single router. This issue can arise, for example, in the case of a home network supporting 802.11 wireless as well as Ethernet. In multi-segment small networks connected by a single router, it may be desirable to provide for consistent IPv4 addressing in the case where the small network has not been assigned a routable IPv4 address prefix. This draft describes how this problem may be solved through implementation of a mini-DHCP server within the router. The router may either be disconnected from the Internet, in which case the hosts on the multiple segments will only be able to reach other, or the router may offer Internet connectivity via Network Address Translation (NAT), or another suitable mechanism, such as RSIP.</t>
