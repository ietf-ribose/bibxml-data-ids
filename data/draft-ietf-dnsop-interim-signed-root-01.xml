      <t>This memo documents a proposed mechanism for a first stage of atransition from an unsigned DNS root to a signed root, such thatthe data in the root zone is accompanied by DNSSEC signatures toallow validation.The underlying reason for signing the root zone is to be able toprovide a more secure DNS hierarchy, where it is possible todistinguish false answers from correct answers.For the special case of the DNS root zone, an interim scheme isproposed. This scheme is mostly aimed at securing the root zoneitself for technical and operational reasons, and to giveoperational experience of DNSSEC.</t>
