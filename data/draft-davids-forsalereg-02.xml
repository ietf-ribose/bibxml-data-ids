      <t>This document defines a simple operational convention of using a reserved underscored node name ("_for-sale") to indicate that the parent domain name above, is for sale. It has the advantage that it can be easily deployed, without affecting any running operations. As such, the method can be applied to a domain name that is still in full use.</t>
