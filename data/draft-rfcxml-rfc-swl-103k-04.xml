    <abstract>
      <t>The SW103k protocol addresses challenges in networks with limited bandwidth, latency constraints, and data integrity concerns. It provides compression and decompression to optimize bandwidth utilization in environments such as IoT, satellite, and mobile communications. The protocol operates at the data link layer with a custom frame format including SW103K and HAVI headers. Key features include: - Batch processing of 103 packets with compression - Merkle tree- based integrity verification (merklesw103k root hash) - QoS mechanisms with 8-bit priority field - Security features including AES-256-GCM encryption - Physical layer synchronization with +-1us accuracy Implementations include Linux kernel modules, FPGA encoders, and userspace daemons. The protocol supports interoperability with industrial standards like PROFINET and EtherCAT through custom mappings.</t>
