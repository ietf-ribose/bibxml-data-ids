      <t>This document describes a new authenticated encryptionmode of operation of block ciphers called 'IntegrityAware Parallelizable Mode (IAPM)' which is simple,efficient, highly parallelizable, and provably secure.One of the main features distinguishing the new mode(IAPM) from existing modes is that along with providingconfidentiality of the payload, the new mode also pro-vides authenticity of the payload. This is particularlyrelevant to the ESP security protocol of IPsec.</t>
