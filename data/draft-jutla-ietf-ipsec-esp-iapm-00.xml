      <t>This document describes a new authenticated encryption mode of operation of block ciphers called 'Integrity Aware Parallelizable Mode (IAPM)' which is simple, efficient, highly parallelizable, and provably secure. One of the main features distinguishing the new mode (IAPM) from existing modes is that along with providing confidentiality of the payload, the new mode also pro- vides authenticity of the payload. This is particularly relevant to the ESP security protocol of IPsec.</t>
