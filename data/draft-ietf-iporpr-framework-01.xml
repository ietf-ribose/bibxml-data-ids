      <t>This document discusses technical issues and requirements of running IP over Resilient Packet Rings. It is the intent of this document to produce a coherent description of all significant approaches, which were and are being considered by the IPORPR working group. Selections of specific approaches, making choices regarding engineering tradeoffs, and detailed protocol specification, are outside of the scope of this framework document.</t>
