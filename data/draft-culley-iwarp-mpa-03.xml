      <t>A framing protocol is defined for TCP that is fully compliant withapplicable TCP RFCs and fully interoperable with existing TCPimplementations. The framing mechanism is designed to work as an'adaptation layer' between TCP and the Direct Data Placement [DDP]protocol, preserving the reliable, in-order delivery of TCP, whileadding the preservation of higher-level protocol record boundariesthat DDP requires.</t>
