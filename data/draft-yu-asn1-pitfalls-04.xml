      <t>A number of IETF protocols make use of Abstract Syntax Notation One(ASN.1), which is a very complex language for describing abstracttypes and values, in addition to several sets of encoding rules forthose types and values. Some of these uses of ASN.1, particularlythe Kerberos protocol [RFC1510] pose implementation problems. Thisdocument analyzes some of the likely problems associated with the useof ASN.1 in IETF protocols, and some possible reasons for theseproblems.</t>
