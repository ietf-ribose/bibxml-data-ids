      <t>A number of IETF protocols make use of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1), which is a very complex language for describing abstract types and values, in addition to several sets of encoding rules for those types and values. Some of these uses of ASN.1, particularly the Kerberos protocol [RFC1510] pose implementation problems. This document analyzes some of the likely problems associated with the use of ASN.1 in IETF protocols, and some possible reasons for these problems.</t>
