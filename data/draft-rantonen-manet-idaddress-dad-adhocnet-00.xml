      <t>Many kinds of mobile user equipments may want to join or createwireless local area network. Today connectivity is usually based onusing the IP address as the identifier for the device. However, suchkinds of devices do not necessary have a static IP address. Someautoconfiguration procedures are developed for fixed networks, butthose procedures have requirements that Manet does not satisfy. Forad hoc networks, some IPv6 address autoconfiguration solutions aredeveloped during recent years.In this document, an autoconfiguration mechanism for mobile ad hoc network nodes will be described. A hardware based addressing will bepresented as one approach to create a temporary IPv6 address.Furthermore, a solution for minimizing Duplicate Address Detectionprocedures while generating a globally unique IPv6 address will beexplained.</t>
