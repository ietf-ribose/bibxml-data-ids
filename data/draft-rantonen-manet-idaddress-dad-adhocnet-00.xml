      <t>Many kinds of mobile user equipments may want to join or create wireless local area network. Today connectivity is usually based on using the IP address as the identifier for the device. However, such kinds of devices do not necessary have a static IP address. Some autoconfiguration procedures are developed for fixed networks, but those procedures have requirements that Manet does not satisfy. For ad hoc networks, some IPv6 address autoconfiguration solutions are developed during recent years. In this document, an autoconfiguration mechanism for mobile ad hoc network nodes will be described. A hardware based addressing will be presented as one approach to create a temporary IPv6 address. Furthermore, a solution for minimizing Duplicate Address Detection procedures while generating a globally unique IPv6 address will be explained.</t>
