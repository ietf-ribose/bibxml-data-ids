      <t>With the rise in realtime communication applications supporting video, there is a need for receivers of the video to setup appropriate expectations on their receive capacity for handling various video image resolutions. Setting up the maximum supported image resolution that could be handled by an Endpoint is important to successfully decode and render the received video streams. This document proposes SDP format specific parameters for specifying the maximum image width and height resolutions along with their behavior under the [RFC3264] Offer/Answer SDP usage.</t>
