      <t>A protocol design flaw in the TLS renegotiation handshake leaves allcurrently implemented protocol version of TLS (SSLv3 to TLSv1.2)vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks where the attacker canestablish a TLS session with a server, send crafted application dataof his choice to the server and then proxy an unsuspecting client'sTLS handshake into the TLS renegotiation handshake of the server. Many applications on top of TLS see the data injected by the attackerand the data sent by the client as a single data stream and assumethat an authentication during the TLS renegotiation handshake orcontained in the client's application data applies to the entire datastream received through the TLS-protected communication channel.This document describes a protocol change for all protocol versionsof TLS and SSLv3 that will fix this vulnerability for allcommunication between updated TLS clients and updated TLS servers.</t>
