      <t>This document analyzes the applicability of the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO) to secure TCP-based network management protocols, specifically NETCONF and gNMI. It describes deployment profiles in which TCP-AO provides per-connection integrity and peer authentication with low operational overhead, either as an alternative to or in combination with TLS/SSH. This document gives guidance on key management (e.g., static keys and operational "key chains") and documents expected behaviors and benefits. No new protocol bits are defined and there are no IANA actions.</t>
