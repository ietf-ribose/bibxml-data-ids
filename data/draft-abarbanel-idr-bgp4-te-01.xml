    <abstract>
      <t>Currently, constraint routing (CR) and traffic engineering (TE) models do not take into consideration the big picture view of IP traffic traversing multiple autonomous systems (AS). Most of the traffic and constraint routing is based on IGP protocols such as OSPF/ISIS, etc. The resulting view of the Internet is limited to one autonomous system and areas or systems within it. Hence, the routing/forwarding functions do not select the optimum path for packets that need to traverse several autonomous systems. The proposal in this draft is that the BGP protocol can be utilized to choose the best BGP routes based on traffic engineered (TE) constraint weights. This information can be propagated between all BGP peers and calculated by the BGP AS border routers before it is deployed to their forwarding tables.</t>
