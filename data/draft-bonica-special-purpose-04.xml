      <t>This memo instructs IANA to restructure its IPv4 and IPv6 Special- Purpose Address Registries. Upon restructuring, the aforementioned registries will record all special-purpose address blocks, maintaining a common set of information regarding each address block. This memo updates RFC 5736 and RFC 4773, which define the current structure of the IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registries. It also obsoletes RFC 5735 and RFC 5156 which document special- purpose address blocks that are not currently, but will in the future, be recorded in the IPv4 and IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registries.</t>
