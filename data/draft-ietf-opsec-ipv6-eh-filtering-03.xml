      <t>It is common operator practice to mitigate security risks by enforcing appropriate packet filtering. This document analyzes both the general security implications of IPv6 Extension Headers and the specific security implications of each Extension Header and Option type. Additionally, it discusses the operational and interoperability implications of discarding packets based on the IPv6 Extension Headers and IPv6 options they contain. Finally, it provides advice on the filtering of such IPv6 packets at transit routers, for those cases in which such filtering is deemed as necessary.</t>
