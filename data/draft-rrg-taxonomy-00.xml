      <t>The Routing Research Group is tasked to design a new routing architecture to meet the challenges of scalability in face of pervasive multi-homing and inter-domain traffic engineering. A number of solutions have been proposed. This draft describes a taxonomy for the design space, and then uses the taxonomy to discuss and compare the proposed solutions.</t>
