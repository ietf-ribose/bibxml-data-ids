      <t>This specification defines the Security Event Token (SET) data structure. A SET describes a statement of fact from the perspective of an issuer about the state of a security subject, which is intended to be shared with one or more recipients. This statement of fact represents an event that occurred to the security subject. In some use cases, the security subject may be a digitial identity, but SETs are also applicable to non-identity use cases. A SET is a JSON Web Token (JWT), which can be optionally signed and/or encrypted. SETs can be distributed via protocols such as HTTP.</t>
