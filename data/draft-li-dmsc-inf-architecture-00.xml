      <t>This document presents an architectural framework for distributed multi-agent collaboration from an infrastructure perspective. It outlines the network requirements introduced by large-scale agent collaboration, and proposes a systematic approach to enabling Distributed Multi-agent Secured Collaboration (DMSC) through infrastructure capabilities. The architecture focuses on how network control and forwarding functions can actively participate in agent collaboration.</t>
