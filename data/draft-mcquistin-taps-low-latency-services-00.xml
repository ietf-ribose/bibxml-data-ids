      <t>This document describes the set of transport services required by low-latency, real-time applications. These services are derived from the needs of the applications, rather than from the current capabilities of the transport layer. An example API, based on the Berkeley Sockets API, is also provided, alongside examples of how the target applications would use the API to access the transport services described.</t>
