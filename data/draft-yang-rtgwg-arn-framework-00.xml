    <abstract>
      <t>With progress of more and more new technologies have been deployed in large scale, such as SRv6 and network slicing, it is highly desirable to open these new capability to applications. Current practice is using ACLs to classify the packet and then map those traffic onto proper network resources. This is the way the application is passively perceived by the network, rather than the application actively calling the network, and changes in application characteristics require triggering network configuration adjustments, making it difficult to deploy at scale. The document proposes a new framework called Application Request Network (ARN), by encapsulating more network functions into ARN ID, thus it opens up interfaces to applications. The vision is to enable applications to access network resources like they access an operating system.</t>
