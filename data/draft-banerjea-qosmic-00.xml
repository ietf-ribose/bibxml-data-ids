      <t>We present, QoSMIC, a multicast protocol for the Internet thatsupports QoS-sensitive routing, and minimizes the importance of a prioriconfiguration decisions (such as core selection). The protocol isresource-efficient, robust, flexible, and scalable. In addition, ourprotocol is provably loop-free. Our protocol starts with a resources-saving tree (Shared Tree) andindividual receivers switch to a QoS-competitive tree (Source-BasedTree) when necessary. In both trees, the new destination is able tochoose the most promising among several paths. An innovation is that weuse dynamic routing information without relying on a link state exchangeprotocol to provide it. Our protocol limits the effect of pre-configuration decisions drastically, by separating the management fromthe data transfer functions; administrative routers are not necessarilypart of the tree. This separation increases the robustness, andflexibility of the protocol. Furthermore, QoSMIC is able to adaptdynamically to the conditions of the network. The QoSMIC protocol introduces several new ideas that make it moreflexible than other protocols proposed to date. In fact, many of theother protocols, (such as YAM, PIM-SM, BGMP, CBT) can be seen as specialcases of QoSMIC. The goal of this document is to present the motivationbehind, and the design of QoSMIC, and to provide both analytical andexperimental results to support our claims. NOTE: The text version of the draft is missing several figures, thatfacilitate the understanding of the work. For this, the authors suggestthe postscript version.</t>
