    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a new conflict resolution mechanism for DNS, for use in cases where the advertisement is being proxied, rather than advertised directly, e.g. when using a combined DNS-SD Advertising Proxy and SRP registrar. A new DNS RR is defined that communicates the time at which the set of resource records on a particular DNS owner name was most recently updated.</t>
