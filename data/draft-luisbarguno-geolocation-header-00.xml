      <t>The Geolocation header introduces a mechanism to send a device location over an HTTP Secure Context from a user agent to a server. The Geolocation-Request header is used by a server to inform the user agent when a Geolocation header is requested to be sent. This mechanism, through persistent Geolocation-Requests, provides a single-roundtrip solution to obtain location-aware responses for location-aware services, as oposed to existing JS-based Geolocation API that require two round trips.</t>
