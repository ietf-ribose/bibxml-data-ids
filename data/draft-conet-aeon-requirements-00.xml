    <abstract>
      <t>Identification and treatment of application flows are important to many application providers and network operators. Historically, this functionality has been implemented to the extent possible using heuristics, which inspect and infer flow characteristics. But many application flows in current usages are dynamic, adaptive, time- bound, encrypted, peer-to-peer, asymmetric, used on multipurpose devices, and have different priorities depending on direction of flow, user preferences, and other factors. Any combination of these properties renders heuristic based techniques less effective and may result in compromises to application security or user privacy. The document states requirements for a solution that enables identification and treatment of application flows without suffering the limitations that plague existing solutions.</t>
