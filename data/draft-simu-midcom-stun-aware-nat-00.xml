      <t>STUN provides an easy way to traverse some types of NATs and it willwork satisfactorily in many NAT deployments. To overcome STUN'slimitations, one solution is to accept the idea that NATs can changetoo (and they've been proven to change, an example being theproliferation of IPsec pass-thru NAT devices) and to colocate STUNserver functionality on the NAT box itself. Upon receipt of a STUNrequest, the server colocated within the NAT device allocatesaddresses and ports, and installs bindings. This allows hostsrunning the STUN client software to transparently achieve symmetricNAT traversal and to make themselves addressable from the GlobalInternet.</t>
