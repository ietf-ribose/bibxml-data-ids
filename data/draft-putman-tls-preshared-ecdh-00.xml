      <t>This document defines a new mutual authentication method for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.2. The authentication method requires that the client and server are each pre-provisioned with a unique asymmetric Elliptic Curve Diffie- Hellman (ECDH) keypair and with the public ECDH key of the peer. The handshake provides ephemeral ECDH keys, and a premaster key is agreed using Double- or Triple-ECDH; confirmation of possession of this key provides mutual authentication. Multiple new cipher suites which use this authentication method are specified.</t>
