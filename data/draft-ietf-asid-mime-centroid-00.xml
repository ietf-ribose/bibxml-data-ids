      <t>This memo defines an directory profile for carrying centroid or other indexing information pertaining to one or more directory entities within an application/directory MIME Content-Type. The profile consists of type definitions, what the types are allowed to contain, and rules for their use and interpretation within the application/directory body part. The scheme is fairly general and with a few extensions could be used to handle directory modification information pertaining to a single entity, or sets of modifications pertaining to many entries, in addition to updates to centroid or other index information that apply to many entities.</t>
