      <t>This document presents a technique for using a Markdown syntax variant, called Pandoc, and a (bit) of XML [RFC2629] as a source format for documents in the Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) and Request for Comments (RFC) series. The goal of this technique is to let an author of an I-D focus on the main body of text without being distracted too much by XML tags, it does however not alleviate the need to typeset some files in XML.</t>
