      <t>Constrained nodes are devices which are limited in terms of processing power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission capacity. Due to these constraints, commonly used security protocols are not easily applicable. Nevertheless, an authentication and authorization solution is needed to ensure the security of these devices. The Delegated CoAP Authorization Framework (DCAF) specifies how resource-constrained nodes can delegate defined authentication- and authorization-related tasks to less-constrained devices called Authorization Managers, thus limiting the hardware requirements of the security solution for the constrained devices. To realize the vision of "one Internet for all", constrained devices need to securely establish trust relationships with less constrained devices. This document lists examples for using DCAF with less constrained devices.</t>
