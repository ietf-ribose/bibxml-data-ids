      <t>This document presents an alternative addressing architecture for IPv6 which controls global routing growth with very aggressive topological aggregation. It also includes support for scalable multihoming as a distinguished service while freeing sites and service resellers from the tyranny of CIDR-based aggregation by providing transparent rehoming of both.</t>
