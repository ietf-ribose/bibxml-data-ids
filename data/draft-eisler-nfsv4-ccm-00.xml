      <t>This document describes a new mechanism under the GSS [RFC2743]. Some protocols, such as RPCSEC_GSS [RFC2203], use GSS to authenticate every message transfer, thereby incurring significant overhead due to the costs of cryptographic computation. While hardware-based cryptographic accelerators can mitigate such overhead, it is more likely that acceleration will be available for lower layer protocols, such as IPsec [RFC2401] than for upper layer protocols like RPCSEC_GSS. CCM can be used as a way to allow GSS mechanism- independent upper layer protocols to leverage the data stream protections of lower layer protocols, without the inconvenience of modifying the upper layer protocol to do so.</t>
