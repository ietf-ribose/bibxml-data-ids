      <t>This memo documents the subset of the Experimental OSI Net (EON) that is in active use today. It serves to document current practice, which deviates somewhat from the usage described in the original RFC. Potential implementors should note that the protocol described herein is archaic and is likely to be replaced in the near future.</t>
