      <t>This document proposes an encoding of PCN marks based on the ECN field of the Voice-Admit DSCP. It has global meaning and ECN semantics are not applied to that field. The PCN codepoints are the same as those for packet-specific dual marking (PSDM) within a single PCN domain, but the general concept can also be applied to other encodings requiring only a single PCN-enabled DSCP.</t>
