      <t>In a nested mobile network situation, the packet transfer routebetween a correspondent node(CN) and a mobile node(MN) may becomemuch longer than in the simple Mobile IP case, because packets canreach endpoints through all of the home agents (HAs) to which themobile routers (MRs) and the MN belong. The existing routeoptimization function of Mobile IPv6 cannot solve this problem,because while it can bypass an MN's HA, it cannot skip the MRs' HAs.Furthermore, there is no route optimization method for communicationnodes without Mobile IPv6 functionality, which are the so-calledlocal fixed nodes (LFNs) within a mobile network. This draft providessolutions to achieve route optimization in these situations by usingHMIP technology and proxy Mobile IP functions.</t>
