      <t>This document describes an architecture for a Multicast-friendly Internet eXchange (MIX), and the actual implementation at the NASA Ames Research Center Federal Internet eXchange (FIX-West, or FIX). The MIX has three objectives: native IP multicast routing, scalable interdomain policy-based route exchange, and to allow a variety of IGP protocols and topologies for intra-domain use. In support of these objectives, the MIX architecture defines the following components: a peer-peer routing protocol, a method for multicast forwarding, a method for exchanging information about active sources, and a medium which provides native multicast. This document describes the protocols and configurations necessary to provide a current, working multicast-friendly internet exchange, or MIX. This memo is a product of the MBONE Deployment Working Group (MBONED) in the Operations and Management Area of the Internet Engineering Task Force.
