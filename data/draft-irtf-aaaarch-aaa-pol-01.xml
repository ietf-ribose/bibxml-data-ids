      <t>This document defines some terms related to the Generic AAA architecture. The first section describes some broad aspects of such an architecture. The second section looks at the various aspects and types of policy that come into play in an AAA architecture. The third section will describe some of the components of a single policy. This work is preliminary and is expected to be complimented by other work from the AAAARCH research group such as [POLICY MODEL] and [POLICY ACCOUNTING].</t>
