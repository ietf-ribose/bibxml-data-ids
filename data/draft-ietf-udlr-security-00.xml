    <abstract>
      <t>Many operators may deploy network infrastructures that use unidirectional links such as broadcast satellite links or digital TV links (...), which are capable of carrying IP traffic. In order to transparently integrate these links in their infrastructure, they may use a link-layer tunnelling mechanism such as defined in [RFC3077]. The purpose of this document is to attempt to identify any potential security implications related to this mechanism in order to help operators set up adequate securing mechanisms.</t>
