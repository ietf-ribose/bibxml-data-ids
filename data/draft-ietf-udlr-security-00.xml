      <t>Many operators may deploy network infrastructures that useunidirectional links such as broadcast satellite links or digital TVlinks (...), which are capable of carrying IP traffic. In order totransparently integrate these links in their infrastructure, they mayuse a link-layer tunnelling mechanism such as defined in [RFC3077].The purpose of this document is to attempt to identify any potentialsecurity implications related to this mechanism in order to helpoperators set up adequate securing mechanisms.</t>
