    <abstract>
      <t>In defining the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), some features have turned up that would be nice to have. In the interest of completing this specification in a timely manner, the present document was started to collect nice-to-have features that did not make it into the first RFC for CDDL, RFC 8610, or the specifications exercising its extension points, such as RFC 9165. Significant parts of this draft have now moved over to the CDDL 2.0 project, described in draft-bormann-cbor-cddl-2-draft. The remaining items in this draft are not directly related to the CDDL 2.0 effort.</t>
