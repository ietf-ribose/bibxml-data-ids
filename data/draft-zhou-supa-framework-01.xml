    <abstract>
      <t>Currently, there are network services that impose specific demands on a communication network. This document describes the SUPA basic architecture, its elements and interfaces. The main SUPA architecture entities are the Service Management (SM) and the Network Manager/Controller (NM/NC). The SM is a functional entity that creates and runs network services by using a set of NM/NCs. The NM/NC is a functional entity that provides one or more of the following functions: (1) the generation, maintenance and release of network topologies, (2) the generation, maintenance, and release of network service-specific abstractions, (3) the mapping between network service-specific abstractions and the network topology, and (4) the mapping between network service-specific abstractions and network device configuration. Both the SM and the NM/NC may be made up of multiple distinct entities that collectively perform their functions.</t>
