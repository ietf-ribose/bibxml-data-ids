      <t>Mobile nodes (e.g., aircraft of various configurations, terrestrial vehicles, seagoing vessels, space systems, enterprise wireless devices, pedestrians with cell phones, etc.) communicate with networked correspondents over multiple access network data links and configure mobile routers to connect end user networks. A multilink virtual interface specification is presented that enables mobile nodes to coordinate with a network-based mobility service and/or with other mobile node peers. The virtual interface provides an adaptation layer service that also applies for more static deployments such as enterprise and home networks. This document specifies the transmission of IP packets over Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI) Interfaces.</t>
