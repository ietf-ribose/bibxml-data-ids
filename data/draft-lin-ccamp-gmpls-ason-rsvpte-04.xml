    <abstract>
      <t>The Generalized MultiProtocol Label Switching (GMPLS) suite of protocol specifications has been defined to provide support for different technologies as well as different applications. These include support for requesting TDM connections based on Synchronous Optical NETwork/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SONET/SDH) as well as Optical Transport Networks (OTNs). This document concentrates on the signaling aspects of the GMPLS suite of protocols, specifically GMPLS signaling using Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE). It proposes additional extensions to these signaling protocols to support the capabilities of an ASON network. This document proposes appropriate extensions towards the resolution of additional requirements identified and communicated by the ITU-T Study Group 15 in support of ITU's ASON standardization effort. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>
