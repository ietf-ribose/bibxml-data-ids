    <abstract>
      <t>Proposed is an approach for supporting emergency 911 services over IEEE 802.11 based Wi-Fi access networks. This approach leverages the legal framework and the building blocks of the OpenRoaming federation for extending emergency 911 calling support to already deployed tens of thousands of OpenRoaming Wi-Fi hotspots. The proposal addresses the key issues in emergency calling, around discovery and authentication to access network supporting emergency services, emergency access credentials, location determination of the emergency caller, and delivering emergency voice service configuration to the device and call routing.</t>
