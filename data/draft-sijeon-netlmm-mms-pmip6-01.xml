      <t>To support IP-based group mobile communication, such as mobile IPTV, IP multicasting is required. Two major constraints in mobile multicasting are the tunnel convergence problem and high handover latency. To reduce the constraints, several mobile multicasting schemes based on Mobile IP have been proposed. To meet requirements, we present a multicasting architecture and fast handover scheme for Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).</t>
