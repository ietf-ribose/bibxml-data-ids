      <t>To support IP-based group mobile communication, such as mobile IPTV,IP multicasting is required. Two major constraints in mobilemulticasting are the tunnel convergence problem and high handoverlatency. To reduce the constraints, several mobile multicastingschemes based on Mobile IP have been proposed. To meet requirements,we present a multicasting architecture and fast handover scheme forProxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6).</t>
