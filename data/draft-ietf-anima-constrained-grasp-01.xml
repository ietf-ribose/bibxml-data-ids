    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes the Constrained GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (cGRASP), a constrained and lightweight variant of the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP, or the standard GRASP). cGRASP reduces message overhead and replaces TCP with CoAP as the transport protocol. By leveraging CoAP's reliability features and deployment maturity, cGRASP can provide reliable signaling services without relying on TCP, making it suitable for IoT, where lightweight and resource-constrained devices dominate. Furthermore, this document also discusses the potential approaches to adapting the cGRASP to work on the network without IP connectivity.</t>
