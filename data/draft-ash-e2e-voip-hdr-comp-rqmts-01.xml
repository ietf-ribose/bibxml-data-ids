      <t>VoIP typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP/. When MPLS labels are added, this becomes voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels. For an MPLS VPN, the packet header is at least 48 bytes, while the voice payload is often no more than 30 bytes. VoIP header compression can significantly reduce the VoIP overhead through various compression mechanisms. This is important on access links where bandwidth is scarce, and can be important on backbone facilities, especially where costs are high (e.g., some global cross-sections). Providing VoIP header compression over multiple hop paths avoids multiple compression/decompression cycles at each router, and thereby increases the processing scalability of the maximum number of simultaneous VoIP flows which use header compression at each router. This draft gives a problem statement, example scenarios, goals, and requirements for VoIP header compression from compressor to decompressor over multiple-hop paths, possibly over MPLS. It also discusses work items and issues for consideration, and highlights various solution alternatives that have been proposed.</t>
