      <t>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), also known as Transparent LAN Service, and Virtual Private Switched Network service, is a useful Service Provider offering. The service offered is a Layer 2 VPN; however, in the case of VPLS, the customers in the VPN are connected by a multipoint network, in contrast to the usual Layer 2 VPNs, which are point-to-point in nature. This document describes the functions required to offer VPLS, and proposes a mechanism for signaling a VPLS, as well as for forwarding VPLS frames across a packet switched network.</t>
