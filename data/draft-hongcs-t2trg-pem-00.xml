    <abstract>
      <t>Renewable energy enabled sustainable energy management ensuresa high degree of reliability in order to fulfill the energydemand of a smart city. In such case, renewable energygeneration is random over time and also energy consumption ofsmart city users’ is nondeterministic in nature. Therefore, toensure sustainable energy management for smart city,a proactive energy management scheme should be integrated intosmart city network. In which, edge node should be considered aslocal computational unit for each energy user and microgridcontroller should be played the role of energy management decisionaggregator. As a result, proactive energy management schemenot only overcomes the challenges of renewable energy-awaredemand scheduling but also establishes a strong relationshipfor both energy generation and consumption over time.Therefore, a distributed mechanism is considered, where the edgenode for executing local agent to determine an individualusers’ policy with respect to energy consumption and renewableenergy generation (users’ own sources). On the other hand,microgrid controller determines meta-policy through a meta-agentwith Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Since a meta-agent acceptslocal policy as an input with historical observations, whichensures fast and efficient execution of proactive energy managementfor the smart city.</t>
