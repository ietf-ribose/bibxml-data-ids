      <t>This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow transparent routing of CLNP datagrams to Mobile Nodes in the Internet. The Mobile Node is always identified by its Home-Address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet. While situated away from its home, a Mobile Node is also associated with a Care-Of-Address, which provides information about its current point of attachment to the Internet. The protocol provides for registering the Care-Of-Address with the Home Agent. The Home Agent tunnels traffic destined for the Mobile Node to the Care-Of-Address.</t>
