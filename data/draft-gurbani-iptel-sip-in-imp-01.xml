      <t>SIP [1] is an excellent vehicle for the converged network services of the future; of that there is no doubt. However, even in the near term, SIP is an equally powerful solution to bridge the PSTN and VoIP networks by its application to the IN (Intelligent Network) services domain. This Internet Draft details our experiences of applying SIP to the said domain. We use a SIP call controller to execute IN services by mapping IN call model states to those of the SIP protocol state machine [2]. [2] uses the notion of call model integration [3], an example of which is to use the IN call model as a canonical call model to map the protocol states of IP (Internet Protocol) based call controllers (SIP, H.323,...) to those of the IN call model.</t>
