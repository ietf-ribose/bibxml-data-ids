      <t>SIP [1] is an excellent vehicle for the converged network services ofthe future; of that there is no doubt. However, even in the nearterm, SIP is an equally powerful solution to bridge the PSTN and VoIPnetworks by its application to the IN (Intelligent Network) servicesdomain.This Internet Draft details our experiences of applying SIP to thesaid domain. We use a SIP call controller to execute IN services bymapping IN call model states to those of the SIP protocol statemachine [2]. [2] uses the notion of call model integration [3], anexample of which is to use the IN call model as a canonical callmodel to map the protocol states of IP (Internet Protocol) based callcontrollers (SIP, H.323,...) to those of the IN call model.</t>
