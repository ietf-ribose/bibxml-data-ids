      <t>This memo introduces per-packet stateless strict and loose path engineered replication and forwarding for Bit Index Explicit Replication packets ([RFC8279]). This is called BIER-TE. BIER-TE leverages the BIER architecture ([RFC8279]) and extends it with a new semantic for bits in the bitstring. BIER-TE can leverage BIER forwarding engines with little or no changes. In BIER, the BitPositions (BP) of the packets bitstring indicate BIER Forwarding Egress Routers (BFER), and hop-by-hop forwarding uses a Routing Underlay such as an IGP. In BIER-TE, BitPositions indicate adjacencies. The BIFT of each BFR are only populated with BPs that are adjacent to the BFR in the BIER- TE topology. The BIER-TE topology can consist of layer 2 or remote (route) adjacencies. The BFR then replicates and forwards BIER packets to those adjacencies. This results in the aforementioned strict and loose path forwarding. BIER-TE can co-exist with BIER forwarding in the same domain, for example by using separate sub-domains. In the absence of routed adjacencies, BIER-TE does not require a BIER routing underlay, and can then be operated without requiring an IGP routing protocol. BIER-TE operates without explicit in-network tree-building and carries the multicast distribution tree in the packet header. It can therefore be a good fit to support multicast path steering in Segment Routing (SR) networks.</t>
