      <t>Network Address and Port Translation (NAPT) works well for conservingglobal addresses and addressing multihoming requirements, because anIPv4 NAPT router implements three functions: source addressselection, next-hop resolution and optionally DNS resolution. ForIPv6 hosts one approach could be the use of IPv6 NAT. However, NATshould be avoided, if at all possible, to permit transparent host-to-host connectivity. In this document, we analyze the use cases ofmultihoming. We also describe functional requirements formultihoming without the use of NAT in IPv6 for hosts and small IPv6networks that would otherwise be unable to meet minimum IPv6allocation criteria .</t>
