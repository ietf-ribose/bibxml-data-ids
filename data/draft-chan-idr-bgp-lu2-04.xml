      <t>This document specifies how to carry colored path advertisement via anenhancement to the existing protocol BGP Label Unicast. It would allow backward compatibility with RFC8277. The targeted solution is to use stack of labels advertised via BGP LabelUnicast 2.0 for end to end traffic steering across multiple IGP domains. The operationis similar to Segment Routing. This proposed protocol will convey the necessary reachability information tothe ingress PE node to construct an end to end path. Another two problems addressed here are the interworking with Flex-Algo, andthe MPLS label space limit problem. Please note that there is a major change of protocol format starting fromversion 01 draft. Except the optional BGP capability code, these rest of BGP attributes used in this draft are defined in previous RFC or in use today in otherscenario.</t>
