      <t>This document describes the use of the AES Cipher Algorithm with 128bit key in Counter (CTR) Mode, with an implicit counter, as aconfidentiality mechanism within the context of the IPsecEncapsulating Security Payload [ESP].CTR is a parallelizable block-cipher mode of operation. It uses theunderlying block cipher as a stream cipher. Accordingly, great caremust be exercised to utilize it appropriately within IPsec.</t>
