      <t>A mobile node will change its access router frequently during a Diameter session and the relevant AAA parameters may also be transferred between the access routers. However, the home AAA server does not know the movement of the mobile node before the mobile node re-authenticates, and a request from the home AAA server will always be forwarded to the former realm. Therefore, an efficient way is needed to forward the request to the new access router.</t>
