    <abstract>
      <t>In this contribution, a design of escape message mechanism is proposed, where the service provider sends an escape message to the service consumer using existing non-PQC connection and then starts to re-establish the quantum-safe protocol. The proposed escape message can potentially be used in a variety of protocols, including IPsec, TLS, or between the air interface of a cellpohone and a network device. We believe that for largely deployed networks and entities, escape messages can be provided as a plan B for legacy devices of the service provider and consumer that may not able to complete post- quantum migration in advance. It can mitigate negative migration impacts when potential Q-day occurs.</t>
