    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes extensions to [RFC2544] throughput search by defining a new methodology called Multiple Loss Ratio search (MLRsearch). The main objectives of MLRsearch are to minimize the total search duration, to support searching for multiple loss ratios and to improve results repeatability and comparability. The main motivation behind extending [RFC2544] is the new set of challenges and requirements posed by evaluating and testing software based networking systems, specifically their data planes. MLRsearch offers several ways to address these challenges, giving user configuration options to select their preferred way.</t>
