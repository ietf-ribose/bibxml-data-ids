      <t>This document describes how to support Route Optimization for Mobile Nodes in IPv6 Mobile Network. The support is provided by Prefix Delegation. Mobile Router gets a prefix from an access router using Prefix Delegation protocol and advertises the delegated prefix to its subnet. Each Mobile Nodes makes its care-of address from the prefix and performs binding update. It allows the Mobile Nodes to communicate with Correspondent Nodes directly, avoiding ingress filtering.</t>
