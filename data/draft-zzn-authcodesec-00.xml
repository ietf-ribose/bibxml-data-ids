    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a mechanism to enhance domain transfer security by transitioning from a shared-secret authorization model to a cryptographic signature-based validation system that enables authorization based on PKIs (Public Key Identification) and hands over control of the domain to a specific next controller identified by their PKI. The process is designed to be fully backward compatible with existing EPP systems through staged incremental upgrades.</t>
