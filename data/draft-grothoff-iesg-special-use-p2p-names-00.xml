      <t>Today, the Domain Name System (DNS) is a key service for the Internet. DNS is primarily used to map human-memorable names to IP addresses, which are used for routing but generally not meaningful for humans. However, the hierarchical nature of DNS makes it unsuitable for various Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Name Systems. As compatibility with applications using DNS names is desired, these overlay networks often define alternative pseudo Top-Level Domains (pTLDs) to integrate names from the P2P domain into the DNS hierarchy. This memo describes common Special-Use Domain Names [RFC6761] pseudo Top-Level DNS Names designed to help harden name resolution security (e.g., [RFC6840][RFC6975]), provide censorship resistance, and protect the users' privacy on the Internet. In this IESG Approval document we are asking for domain name reservations for five Special-Use Domain Names [RFC6761] TLDs: ".gnu", ".zkey", ".onion", ".exit", and ".i2p".</t>
