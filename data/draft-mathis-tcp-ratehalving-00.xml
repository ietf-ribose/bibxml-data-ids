      <t>This draft provides a detailed description of the Rate-Halvingalgorithm. As specified by RFC2581, Fast Recovery adjusts thecongestion window (cwnd) by transmitting new data only during thesecond half of the recovery interval. The Rate-Halving algorithmadjusts the congestion window by spacing transmissions at the rate ofone data segment per two segments acknowledged over the entirerecovery period, thereby sustaining the self-clocking of TCP andavoiding a burst. Since it is largely independent of the details ofthe data retransmission strategy, the Rate-Halving algorithm can beused with several standard and experimental TCP implementations:NewReno, SACK, and ECN.</t>
