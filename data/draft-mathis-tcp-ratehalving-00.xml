      <t>This draft provides a detailed description of the Rate-Halving algorithm. As specified by RFC2581, Fast Recovery adjusts the congestion window (cwnd) by transmitting new data only during the second half of the recovery interval. The Rate-Halving algorithm adjusts the congestion window by spacing transmissions at the rate of one data segment per two segments acknowledged over the entire recovery period, thereby sustaining the self-clocking of TCP and avoiding a burst. Since it is largely independent of the details of the data retransmission strategy, the Rate-Halving algorithm can be used with several standard and experimental TCP implementations: NewReno, SACK, and ECN.</t>
