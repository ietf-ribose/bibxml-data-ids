      <t>This document describes a virtual private LAN service (VPLS) solution over MPLS, also known as Transparent LAN Services (TLS). A VPLS creates an emulated LAN segment for a given set of users. It delivers a layer 2 broadcast domain that is fully capable of learning and forwarding on Ethernet MAC addresses that is closed to a given set of users. Many VPLS services can be supported from a single PE node. This document describes the control plane functions of signaling demultiplexor labels, extending [PWE3-CTRL] and rudimentary support for availability (multi-homing). It is agnostic to discovery protocols. The data plane functions of forwarding are also described, focusing, in particular, on the learning of MAC addresses. The encapsulation of VPLS packets is described by [PWE3- ETHERNET].</t>
