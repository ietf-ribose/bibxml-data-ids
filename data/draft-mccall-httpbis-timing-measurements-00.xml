      <t>This memo presents a method for allowing an HTTP server to gather relevant performace data from compliant user-agents. Though the HTML 5 standard supplies Nav-Timings there is no standard way for that data to be communicated back to an origin. The intention of this document is to describe a method in which that can be done cleanly and scalably.</t>
