    <abstract>
      <t>RFC 2544 has defined a benchmarking methodology for network interconnect devices. We recommend a few upgrades to it for producing more reasonable results. The recommended upgrades can be classified into two categories: the application of the novelties of RFC 8219 for the legacy RFC 2544 use cases and the following new ones. Checking a reasonably small timeout individually for every single frame in the throughput and frame loss rate benchmarking procedures. Performing a statistically relevant number of tests for all benchmarking procedures. Addition of an optional non-zero frame loss acceptance criterion for the throughput measurement procedure and defining its reporting format.</t>
