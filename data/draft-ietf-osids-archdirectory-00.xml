      <t>The proliferation of publicly accessible archives in the Internet has created an ever-widening gap between the fact of the existence of such archives, and knowledge about the existence and contents of these archives in the user community. Related to this problem is the problem of also providing users with the necessary information on the mechanisms available to retrieve such archives. In order for the Internet user community to better avail themselves of this class of resources, there is a need for these gaps in knowledge to be bridged.</t>
