      <t>The IETF has a variety of activities beyond those that are part of the standards process. IETF activities that aren't part of the standards process are still quite useful for the IETF mission. Some of these activities, such as IETF hackathons, tutorials, and mentoring, occur at in-person meetings. There has been and continues to be interest in having such activities located in different geographical areas. The document defines how the IETF organizes our Geographically- Focused Activities. It is intended for eventual publication as a BCP but this is currently an initial strawman proposal based upon the existing variety of experience with the experimental activities in this space over the past several years.</t>
