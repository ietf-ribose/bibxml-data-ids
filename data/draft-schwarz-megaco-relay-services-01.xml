      <t>This document describes the terminology and gives a network model for different strategies concerning Voiceband Data (VBD) transport services. The purpose of this effort is to set the reference space for describing and evaluating Megaco/H.248 signaling procedures. Primary scope are voiceband data services, typically inherent part in voice-over-packet networks (e.g., like Internet Telephony). Motivation: VBD calls typically start out as a voice call. The modems on the VBD devices at the Termination detect the switch to VBD (like facsimile) and fax modem or data modem transmission begins. With the development of Voice over IP, many CODECs have been developed which are optimized for the transmission and reception of voice. In creating these CODECs, VBD transport may not reliably be used over the same transmission channel. In an effort to optimize the transmission of VBD, specialized protocols (e.g., T.38, or V.150) have been developed to provide a more reliable transport, minimize bandwidth usage, etc.</t>
