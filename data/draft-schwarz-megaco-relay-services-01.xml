      <t>This document describes the terminology and gives a network model fordifferent strategies concerning Voiceband Data (VBD) transport services.The purpose of this effort is to set the reference space for describingand evaluating Megaco/H.248 signaling procedures. Primary scope arevoiceband data services, typically inherent part in voice-over-packetnetworks (e.g., like Internet Telephony).Motivation:VBD calls typically start out as a voice call. The modems on the VBDdevices at the Termination detect the switch to VBD (like facsimile) andfax modem or data modem transmission begins. With the development ofVoice over IP, many CODECs have been developed which are optimized forthe transmission and reception of voice. In creating these CODECs, VBDtransport may not reliably be used over the same transmission channel.In an effort to optimize the transmission of VBD, specialized protocols(e.g., T.38, or V.150) have been developed to provide a more reliabletransport, minimize bandwidth usage, etc.</t>
