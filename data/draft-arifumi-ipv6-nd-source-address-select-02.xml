      <t>This document describes a Neighbor Discovery IPv6 Source Address Selection(SAS) Policy option for distributing of source address selection policies to end nodes. This option is particularly effective when a consumer site has multiple address blocks. Every end node is guided by such a policy in selecting an appropriate source address for each destination address. This makes it possible for an end node to set up a connection without concern for transfer failures due to ingress filtering by ISPs, for ISP operators to manage user behavior and networking policy, and for consumers to be provided with networks that are almost automatically robust and reliable.</t>
