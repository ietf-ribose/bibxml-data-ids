      <t>This document defines an LDAP [1] object class called 'inetLocalMailRecipient' and associated attributes that provide a way to designate an LDAP entry as one that represents a local (intra- organizational) email recipient, to specify the recipient's email address(es), and to provide routing information pertinent to the recipient. This is intended to support SMTP [2] message transfer agents in routing RFC 822-based email [3] within a private enterprise only, and is not to be used in the process of routing email across the public Internet.</t>
