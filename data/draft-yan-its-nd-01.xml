    <abstract>
      <t>For C-ACC, Platooning and other typical use cases in ITS, how to establish direct IP communication paths between neighbor vehicles poses two issues: how to discover the neighbor vehicle and the nearby service (from the upper layer); how to discover the link-layer address of the selected vehicle (from the lower layer). This draft aims to solve these problems based on mDNS.</t>
