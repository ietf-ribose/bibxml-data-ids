      <t>This document presents a problem statement on collaborative mitigation of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. The evolving trends of DDoS attacks, including their types, intensities, and attack methods, pose formidable challenges to existing defense systems. This problem statement examines the current defense landscape, highlighting the distributed deployment of defense systems across various network positions and the imbalances in defense capabilities. Collaboration is crucial for effective DDoS attack mitigation, considering that a considerable number of attacks are spread across operators. The existing collaborative framework, DOTS, shows promise but requires addressing these challenges to enhance its efficacy. The existing collaborative framework DOTS demonstrates potential, but there are still numerous challenges in its practical application. This document aims to address these key issues that impact the implementation of collaborative technologies.</t>
