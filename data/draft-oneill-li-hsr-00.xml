      <t>This memo overviews the need for intra-domain Host specific routing (HSR) in the Internet. Host Specific Routing provides a number of benefits if route entry and look-up scalability issues can be adequately addressed. These benefits are the enabling of flat routing domains that eliminate the need for hierarchy and associated configuration, and the potential to support rapid movement of IP addresses through the routing fabric. This draft describes some of the current work in this area, including TORA and Wireless Internet Protocol (WIP), and the as yet unresolved research issues associated with large-scale host routing. This draft requires and makes no topological assumptions for HSR. Specifically it does not require a strict tree, as implied by CIP and HAWAII. These micro-mobility protocols do however share many of the scalability and inter-protocol issues associated with host specific routes.</t>
