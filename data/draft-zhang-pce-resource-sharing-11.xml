    <abstract>
      <t>Resource sharing in a network means two or more Label Switched Paths (LSPs) use common pieces of resource along their paths. This can help save network resources and is useful in scenarios such as LSP recovery or when two LSPs do not need to be active at the same time. A Path Computation Element (PCE) is responsible for path computation with such requirement. Existing extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) allow one path computation request for an LSP to be associated with other (existing) LSPs through the use of the PCEP Association Object. This document extends PCEP in order to support resource-sharing- based path computation as another use of the Association Object to enable better efficiency in the computation and in the resultant paths and network resource usage.</t>
