      <t>In IPv6 networks, there remains a need to provide IPv4 service for some residual devices. This document describes a mechanism for allocating IPv4 addresses to such devices, using DHCPv4 with an IPv6 transport. It is done by putting a special relay agent function (Client Relay Agent) on the client side, as well as extending the behavior of the server; in the case where DHCP server only supports IPv4 transport, a relay agent is extended to support IPv6 transport (IPv6-Transport Relay Agent) and relay DHCP traffic for the server, with a new Relay Agent Information sub-option added to carry the IPv6 address of the Client Relay Agent.</t>
