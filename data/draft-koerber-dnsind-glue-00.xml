      <t>The GLUE-type Resource records offer an alternative to the use of traditional address records (A, AAAA, A6) as glue in parent zones. The intention is that GLUE-type records are only ever returned in the additional section of referrals, rather than as reply to address queries to a parent nameserver which is not actually responsible for the delegated zone.</t>
