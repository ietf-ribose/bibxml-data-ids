      <t>The GLUE-type Resource records offer an alternative to the use oftraditional address records (A, AAAA, A6) as glue in parent zones.The intention is that GLUE-type records are only ever returned in theadditional section of referrals, rather than as reply to addressqueries to a parent nameserver which is not actually responsible forthe delegated zone.</t>
