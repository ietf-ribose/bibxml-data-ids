      <t>This document introduces an intent-based framework for network services autonomic deployment and management. It autonomically deploys network services that require customized combinations of network resources and dynamically manage these resources throughout their lifecycle. The framework leverages the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (GRASP) to facilitate the dynamic exchange of resource management signals among autonomic nodes, thereby enabling coordinated and consistent operations within an autonomic network domain. This framework is generic and applicable to most types of network resources.</t>
