      <t>The traditional FTP protocol includes a TYPE command to specify the data representation. That command has values for ASCII and EBCDIC text, plus binary ("IMAGE") transmission. As the Internet becomes more international, there is a growing requirement to be able to transmit textual data, encoded in Unicode, in a way that is independent of the coding and line representation forms of particular operating systems. This memo specifies a new FTP representation TYPE value for Unicode data.</t>
