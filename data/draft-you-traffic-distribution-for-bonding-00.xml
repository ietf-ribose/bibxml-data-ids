      <t>GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) Tunnel Bonding as an L3 overlay tunneling mechanism is used for Hybrid Access (HA) bonding between HCPE (Hybrid Customer Premises Equipment) and HAG (Hybrid Access Gateway). The bonding performance depends upon the performance for each individual link. This document specifies a trying overflow mechanism to avoid the bonding performance downgrading due to the situation that an individual link is disrupted or its quality downgrages too much so that the bonding is no longer applicable.</t>
