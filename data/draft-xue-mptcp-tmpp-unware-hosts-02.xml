      <t>Transparent MPTCP Proxy(TMPP) is an introduced network-based function, which is under MPTCP architecture. It can help two MPTCP- unaware hosts enjoy multipath support, and can be extensively used both in the access networks and operators' networks. Meanwhile, in MPTCP architecture with TMPP, TMPP needs to modify the received packets and transmit them again(just like gateway in NAT environment). In this document, we also discuss the guarantee for data transfer on TMPP's side. The consideration of data transfer can be expanded to the MPTCP architecture with proxy.</t>
