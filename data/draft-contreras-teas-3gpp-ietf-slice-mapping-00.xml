    <abstract>
      <t>3GPP is introducing the concept of slicing as a primary way of service delivery. Slicing at 3GPP implies the differentiation of services in terms of performance expectations as well as the connection of different network entities also potentially differentiated per slice. With that aim, 3GPP is defining a number of logical constructs with the intent of being served with specific characteristics, determined by different QoS profiles. This document describes the connectivity of 3GPP slices through IETF Network Slice services taking into account that specific service level objectives, and identifies gaps existing nowadays on both 3GPP and IETF specifications for an straightforward mapping of parameters between both environments.</t>
