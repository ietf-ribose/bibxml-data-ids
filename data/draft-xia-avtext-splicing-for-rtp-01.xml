      <t>This memo outlines RTP splicing. Splicing is a process that replaces the content of the main multimedia stream with other multimedia content, and delivers the substitutive multimedia content to receiver for a period of time. This memo provides some RTP splicing use cases, then we enumerate a set of requirements and analyze whether an existing RTP level middlebox can meet these requirements, at last we provide concrete guidelines for how the chosen middlebox works to handle RTP splicing.</t>
