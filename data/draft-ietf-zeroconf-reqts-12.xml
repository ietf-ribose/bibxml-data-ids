      <t>Many common TCP/IP protocols such as DHCP [RFC2131], DNS[RFC1034][RFC1035], MADCAP [RFC2730], and LDAP [RFC2251] must beconfigured and maintained by an administrative staff. This isunacceptable for emerging networks such as home networks, automobilenetworks, airplane networks, or ad hoc networks at conferences,emergency relief stations, and many others. Such networks may benothing more than two isolated laptop PCs connected via a wirelessLAN. For all these networks, an administrative staff will not existand the users of these networks neither have the time nor inclinationto learn network administration skills. Instead, these networks needprotocols that require zero user configuration and administration.This document is part of an effort to define such zero configuration(zeroconf) protocols.Before embarking on defining zeroconf protocols, protocolrequirements are needed. This document states the zeroconf protocolrequirements for four protocol areas; they are: IP interfaceconfiguration, translation between host name and IP address, IPmulticast address allocation, and service discovery. This documentdoes not define specific protocols, just requirements. Therequirements for these four areas result from examining everyday useor scenarios of these protocols.</t>
