      <t>Early Media is the ability of two SIP user agents to communicate before a SIP call is actually established. Support for early media is important largely for interoperability with the PSTN.

We define the problem of early media, document and describe the difficulties with the current approach used in SIP UAs, and present a more formal protocol mechanism that resolves these difficulties</t>
