      <t>Early Media is the ability of two SIP user agents to communicatebefore a SIP call is actually established. Support for early media isimportant largely for interoperability with the PSTN. Unfortunately,many SIP devices are providing this capability today without a well-documented, consistent, and complete solution. We define the problemof early media, document and describe the difficulties with thecurrent approach used in SIP UAs, and present a more formal protocolmechanism that resolves these difficulties</t>
