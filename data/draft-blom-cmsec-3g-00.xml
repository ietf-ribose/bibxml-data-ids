      <t>As emerging real-time services on the Internet, such as Voice over IP (VoIP), increase their visibility, a security framework has to be provided. In particular, confidentiality is a main concern in the multimedia scenario. To support full flexibility of the services, a solution with IP all the way (to the terminal) is believed to offer advantages, if technically and economically feasible. Therefore, new requirements have to be met on cellular access networks, and this has an impact on the security solutions.</t>
