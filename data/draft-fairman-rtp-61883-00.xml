      <t>This document describes a payload format for transporting IEC 61883-1[2] (CIP) compliant IEEE1394 isochronous transport data using RTP. A 1394[3] CIP isochronous transport may carry a stream format, such as DV[4], AM824[5] or MPEG[6], that has been packetized for isochronous transport by the source. The format is opaque to the transport mechanism. The isochronous transport clock is derived from the 1394 cycle timer clock. This protocol may be used to transport 1394 61883 streams between 1394 buses by IP, specifically Ethernet/IP.</t>
