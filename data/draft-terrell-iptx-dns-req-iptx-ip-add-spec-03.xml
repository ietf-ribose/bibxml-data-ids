      <t>This paper defines the changes as would be required for the Domain NameSystem (DNS) to support the Network(s) IP Addresses assigned and listedusing the Globalnet's Backbone, which are defined by the IPtX IPAddressing Protocol Family Specification. Furthermore, notwithstandingthe requirements necessitated by change, this presentation retains thecurrent Communications Protocol Specifications, which are currently usedfor the DNS Query in the IPv4 Specification. And while the DNS Service for the IPt1 Specification is identical to the IPv4 Specification. However, because the other IP Addressing Protocols define within the IPtX Protocol Specification requires the use of Prefixes, which change the Header Size Specification. The implementation of these IP Addressing Systems, while using the same Communications Protocol Specifications, nevertheless, redefines the Structure for the Naming Convention used in the DNS Hierarchy. Even still, asides from the clarity, referencing the RFC's governing the DNS Service Specifications will be somewhat limited. This is because the overall functions, and their respective Definitions for the IPv4 DNS Specification will not change in the IPtX DNS Specification. Hence, the objective this paper specifically maintains concerns only the presentation of the Subject-Matter relating to the change in the DNS Service(s), resulting from the implementation of the IPtX IP Addressing Protocol Specification. In other words, the paper does not represent a replacement for any of RFCs,which implemented the DNS Services. It should nonetheless, be considered an extension, which focuses upon the changes in the DNS Services resulting from the implementation of the IPtX IP Protocol Specification.</t>
