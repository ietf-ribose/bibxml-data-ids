      <t>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (bfd) defined in RFC5880 is comprehensive and has sufficient mechanisms to overcome challenges in surviving Graceful Restart (Planned). However, implementations with architectural limitation were found to influence a BFD failure, in a process intensive environment.This memo outlines design options to overcome the challenges, within the existing bfd framework, in surviving planned GracefulRestart.</t>
