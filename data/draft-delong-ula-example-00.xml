    <abstract>
      <t>To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating documented examples to deployed systems, an IPv6 Unicast Address prefix is reserved for use in examples in RFCs, books, documentation, and the like. Since the publication of [RFC 4193] (ULA), it is necessary to provide examples of ULA addresses in various documents, including some Internet-Drafts currently under consideration. This draft seeks to add ULA prefixes reserved for documentation purposes similar to the GUA reservation specified in [RFC3489]</t>
