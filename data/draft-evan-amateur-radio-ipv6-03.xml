      <t>This document defines a method for generating stable IPv6 Interface Identifiers for amateur packet radio nodes. This method is meant to be an alternative to hardware address based Interface Identifier generation such that the benefits of stable addressing may be achieved even on nodes that have unstable, changing, or experimental networking hardware. Instead of a physically-derived address, this method utilizes a unique hash of the node's government-assigned callsign as the basis for its Interface Identifier.</t>
