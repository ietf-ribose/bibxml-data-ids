      <t>Security of the IP Network is always one of the primary concerns ofthe network design and normally used layered approach. It isrecommended not to rely on a single layer of defense, but toconfigure multi-layer security measures.The primary purpose of this paper is to propose a simple andeffective solution to enhance the security of EDGE devices which areconnected to external users in a Service Provider network. MostService Providers commonly use ingress filtering as one of themethods to filter traffic to secure edge devices of theirinfrastructure from external users. The proposed technique will usea special wildcard mask on the network addresses to limit theaccessibility of the Service Provider EDGE devices from externalusers. This will greatly enhance the security of the ServiceProvider's edge devices from malicious attacks such as Denial ofService (DoS).</t>
