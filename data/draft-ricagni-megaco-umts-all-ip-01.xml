      <t>This contribution contains a study aimed at investigating the possible protocols for multimedia call management in 3GPP All-IP networks, and at providing the shared technical background required to chose the most appropriate one. In this first version, call flows are described for multimedia calls using H.248 as the call control protocol and for a basic call (voice call) over UMTS IP network. Further versions of this document will investigate other protocols among those selected by 3GPP (H.248, H.323, SIP), and the advantages and drawbacks of each approach will be highlighted. The network reference model is the same one proposed by 3GPP for an all-IP UMTS Core Network. [2]</t>
