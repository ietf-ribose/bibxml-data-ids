      <t>This document applies only to non-trivial extensions of TLS, which require formal analysis. It proposes the authors provide a threat model and informal security goals in the Security Considerations section, and a protocol diagram in the draft. We also briefly present a few pain points of the one doing the formal analysis which require refining the process: * Contacting FATT * Understanding the opposing goals * No response from some authors * Slots at meeting</t>
