      <t>IPsec supports secure communication over potentially insecure networkcomponents such as intermediate routers. IPsec protocols support twooperating modes, transport mode and tunnel mode. Explicit CongestionNotification (ECN) is an experimental addition to the IP architecturethat provides notification of onset of congestion to delay- or loss-sensitive applications. ECN provides congestion notifications toenable adaptation to network conditions without the impact of droppedpackets [RFC 2481]. The use of two bits in the IPsec header for ECNexperimentation conflicts with header processing at IPsec tunnelendpoints in a manner that makes ECN unusable in the presence ofIPsec tunnels. This document considers issues related to thisconflict, describes two alternative solutions, and updates the IPsecarchitecture [RFC 2401] to include these alternatives. Support forone or the other of these alternatives is REQUIRED to remove theunderlying conflict.</t>
