      <t>To protect an Explicit Routed Label Switched Path (ER-LSP) anexplicitly routed LSP can be used as a recovery path. We consider arepair scheme where a Recovery LSP (R-LSP) spans one or several hops.After a switchover of traffic to the R-LSP we want to allow thetraffic to merge onto the original LSP at the merging node downstreamof the fault without causing any extra resource reservation. Thismerge operation differs in a number of details from that employed fora normal MP2P LSP.Our objective is to define extensions to both CR-LDP and RSVP-TE thataddress these differences. CR-LDP and RSVP-TE are defined in [CR-LDP]and [RSVP-TE], respectively, for path setup within a MPLS domain. Inthis draft we specify mechanisms required to support this merge.</t>
