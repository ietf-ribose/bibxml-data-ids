      <t>This draft introduces the Unified Network and Cloud Orchestration Framework (UNCO), which is designed to enable real-time and joint orchestration of network and computing resources in 5G and future- generation networks. UNCO framework addresses inefficiencies in current resource scheduling mechanisms, resolves objective conflicts across domains, and provides unified policy and security management. It is applicable in emerging scenarios such as ultra-reliable low- latency communications (URLLC), mobile edge computing (MEC), and network slicing, where service quality and operational efficiency are paramount.</t>
