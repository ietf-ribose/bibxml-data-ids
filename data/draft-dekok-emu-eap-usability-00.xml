      <t>This document defines methods which enable simpler deployment of TLS- based EAP methods. It defines new certificate fields, and uses existing certificate fields in order describe new methods for bootstrapping security. The methods defined here change TLS-based EAP supplicant configuration from a complex and insecure process to one that is automated, and is essentially trivial. These methods are still, however, compatible with existing standards and practices.</t>
