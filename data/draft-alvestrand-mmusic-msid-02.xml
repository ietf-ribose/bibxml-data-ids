      <t>This document specifies a grouping mechanism for RTP media streams that can be used to specify relations between media streams within different RTP sessions as well as within a single RTP session. This mechanism is used to signal the association between the RTP concept of SSRC and the WebRTC concept of "media stream" / "media stream track" using SDP signaling. This document is an input document for discussion. It should be discussed in the MMUSIC WG list, mmusic@ietf.org.</t>
