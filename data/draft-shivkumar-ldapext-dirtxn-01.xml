      <t>The directory is becoming an important part of the organization. As the data in the directory becomes more critical, it needs to be consistent. With more applications storing information in the directory, there is a need for transaction (atomic commit/rollback) services to be offered by the directory to ensure consistency. This document describes a mechanism to implement transaction service in a distributed replicated directory. It also describes the LDAP APIs that can be used to provide a standard interface for the transaction service.</t>
