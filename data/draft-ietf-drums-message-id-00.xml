      <t>This is a proposal of a text to include msgfmt in order to clarify the relation between changes in the ''Message-ID'' header and other parts of a message. This information is important, because many mailers use the ''Message-ID'' to eliminate duplicates of the same message, and information may be lost if this is not done the right way. Temporary note This document does not at this time (21 November 1997) represent any consensus opinion in the drums working group.</t>
