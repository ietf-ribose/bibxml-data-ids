      <t>Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) is a technology to enable service differentiation within an IP network. Flexible Algorithm (FA) is another mechanism of creating a sub-topology within a topology using defined topology constraints and computation algorithm. In order to deploy mLDP in a network that supports MTR and/or FA, mLDP is required to become topology and FA aware. This document specifies extensions to mLDP to support MTR with FA such that when building a Multi-Point LSPs it can follow a particular topology and algorithm.</t>
