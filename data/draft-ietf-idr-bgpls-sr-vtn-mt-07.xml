    <abstract>
      <t>Enhanced VPNs aim to deliver VPN services with enhanced characteristics to customers who have specific requirements on their connectivity, such as guaranteed resources, latency, or jitter. Enhanced VPNs require integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and the characteristics provided by the underlay network. A Network Resource Partition (NRP) is a subset of the network resources and associated policies on each of a connected set of links in the underlay network. An NRP could be used as the underlay to support one or a group of enhanced VPN services. When Segment Routing is used as the data plane of NRPs, each NRP can be allocated with a group of Segment Identifiers (SIDs) to identify the topology and resource attributes of network segments in the NRP. The association between the network topology, the network resource attributes and the SR SIDs may need to be distributed to a centralized network controller. In some network scenarios, each NRP can be associated with a unique logical network topology. This document describes a mechanism to distribute the information of SR based NRPs using BGP-Link State (BGP-LS) with Multi-Topology (MT).</t>
