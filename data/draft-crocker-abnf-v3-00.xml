      <t>Internet technical specifications often need to define aformat syntax and are free to employ whatever notation theirauthors deem useful. Over the years, a modified version ofBackus-Naur Form (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), hasbeen popular among many Internet specifications. Itbalances compactness and simplicity, with reasonablerepresentational power. In the early days of the Arpanet,each specification contained its own definition of ABNF.This included the email specifications, [RFC733] and then[RFC822] which have come to be the common citations fordefining ABNF. The current document separates out thatdefinition, to permit selective reference. Predictably, italso provides some modifications and enhancements.The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve namingrules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, andvalue ranges. Appendix A (Core) supplies rule definitionsand encoding for a core lexical analyzer of the type commonto several Internet specifications. It is provided as aconvenience and is otherwise separate from the meta languagedefined in the body of this document, and separate from itsformal status.</t>
