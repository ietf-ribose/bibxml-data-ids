    <abstract>
      <t>Internet of Things (IoT) devices are commonly added to home networks without fully understanding which services (hosts, ports, protocols) are being provided or consumed for those devices to operate. As a result, they are essentially unmanaged threats with full access to that network and the internet. The Defend the World from IoT Remote- threats &amp; Malware (DWIRM) extension to DHCP provides a framework for IoT devices to negotiate services that the local router in turn enforces as policy.</t>
