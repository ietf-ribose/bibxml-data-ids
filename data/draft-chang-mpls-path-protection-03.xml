    <abstract>
      <t>It is expected that MPLS-based recovery could become a viable option for obtaining faster restoration than layer 3 rerouting. To deliver reliable service, however, multi-protocol label switching (MPLS)[ ], [ ] requires a set of procedures to provide protection of the traffic carried on the label switched paths (LSPs). This imposes certain requirements on the path recovery process [ ], and requires procedures for the configuration of working and protection paths, for the communication of fault information to appropriate switching elements, and for the activation of appropriate switchover actions. This document specifies a mechanism for path protection switching and restoration in MPLS networks.</t>
