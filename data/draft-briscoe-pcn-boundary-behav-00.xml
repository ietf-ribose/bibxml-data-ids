      <t>The Pre-Congestion Notification Architecture document defines a PCNdomain and the PCN-ingress and PCN-egress nodes that form itsboundary. The present document is an attempt to describe thedetailed behaviour of the PCN boundary nodes. It is a contributiontoward the PCN WG milestone: "Suggested Flow Admission andTermination Boundary Mechanisms". This first version is expected toevolve with discussion and further thought toward a more precise andprescriptive view of boundary node behaviour.</t>
