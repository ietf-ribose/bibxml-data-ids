      <t>Internet connectivity and use of data services in 3GPP based mobile networks has increased rapidly as a result of smart phones, broadband service via HSPA and HSPA+ networks, competitive service offerings by operators and a large number of applications. Operators who have deployed networks based on 3GPP architectures are facing IPv4 address shortages. With the impending exhaustion of available IPv4 addresses from the registries there is an increased emphasis for operators to migrate to IPv6. This document describes the support for IPv6 in 3GPP network architectures.</t>
