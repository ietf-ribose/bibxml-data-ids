      <t>The Domain Name System (DNS) has provided some means, such as CNAME or DNAME, where a query can be redirected to a different name. The zone operator should be careful about this redirection, which may forms a loop. The detail analysis of xNAME loop detection and its impacts are not specified in the RFC 1035 and RFC 2672. This document gives a detail analysis of xNAME loop and its impacts. It also gives some advices for using xNAME.</t>
