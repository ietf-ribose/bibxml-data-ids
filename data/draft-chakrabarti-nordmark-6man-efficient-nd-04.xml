      <t>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (RFC 4861) protocol has been designed for neighbor's address resolution, unreachability detection, address autoconfiguration, router advertisement and solicitation. With the progress of Internet adoption on various industries including home, wireless, M2M and cellular networks there is a desire for optimizing the legacy IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol. This document describes a method of optimization by reducing multicast messages and introducing an IPv6 address Registration mechanism. The optimization of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol is useful for Wirless and low- power IPv6 networks and as well as Data Centers and Home Networks. The solution is capable of handling existing legacy IPv6 nodes in the network with local mobility.</t>
