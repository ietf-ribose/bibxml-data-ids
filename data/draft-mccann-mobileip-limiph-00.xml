    <abstract>
      <t>There are currently a number of proposals for different mechanisms intended to reduce the overhead of IP mobility management. Generally speaking, the goal of these proposals is twofold: first, to reduce the latency or interruption due to handoffs; and second, to reduce the signaling load on the Mobile IP Home Agent (and Correspondent Nodes, for the case of Mobile IPv6). These techniques are meant to improve the performance of real-time applications like voice or video over IP over wireless networks. By minimizing the period of interruption during a handoff from one point of attachment to another, the proposals attempt to minimize packet loss when these events occur. This draft argues that the best solution to this problem is a 'transparent' one that requires no changes to the Mobile IP clients in mobile nodes and that gives control over routing functionality to the operator of a wireless network. We review some of the existing proposals and describe in detail a new proposal that can provide for low interruption handoffs in a more transparent manner.</t>
