      <t>There are currently a number of proposals for different mechanismsintended to reduce the overhead of IP mobility management. Generallyspeaking, the goal of these proposals is twofold: first, to reducethe latency or interruption due to handoffs; and second, to reducethe signaling load on the Mobile IP Home Agent (and CorrespondentNodes, for the case of Mobile IPv6). These techniques are meant toimprove the performance of real-time applications like voice orvideo over IP over wireless networks. By minimizing the period ofinterruption during a handoff from one point of attachment toanother, the proposals attempt to minimize packet loss when theseevents occur. This draft argues that the best solution to thisproblem is a 'transparent' one that requires no changes to theMobile IP clients in mobile nodes and that gives control overrouting functionality to the operator of a wireless network. Wereview some of the existing proposals and describe in detail a newproposal that can provide for low interruption handoffs in a moretransparent manner.</t>
