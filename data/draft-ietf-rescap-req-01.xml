    <abstract>
      <t>A variety of resource identifiers have been widely deployed on the Internet as a means of identifying various resources, services, and destinations. However, a means of attaching a set of attributes or characteristics to a given resource identifier and subsequently assessing those attributes or characteristics has not been specified and deployed. Two tasks are envisioned. The first task will be to define a general resolution protocol that will translate resource identifiers to a list of attributes. The second task will be to define an administrative model and update protocol that can be used to set up and maintain the information the resolution protocol accesses.</t>
