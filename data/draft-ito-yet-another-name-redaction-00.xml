      <t>This document describes mechanisms to allow CT log submitters to submit name redacted certificates. While public Certificate Transparency (CT) logs allow anyone to observe server certificates and make confident to trust Certificate Authorities (CAs), there are some problems scaling to mass devices. This document presents some use cases, and describes a use of name redacted certificates that retains most of the security benefits that gained from using Certificate Transparency.</t>
