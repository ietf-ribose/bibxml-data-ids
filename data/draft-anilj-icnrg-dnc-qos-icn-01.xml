    <abstract>
      <t>Mechanisms for specifying and implementing end-to-end Quality of service (QoS) treatments in Information-Centric Networks (ICN) has not been explored so far. There has been some work towards implementing QoS in ICN; however, the discussions are mainly centered around strategies used in efficient forwarding of Interest packets. Moreover, as ICN has been tested mainly as an IP overlay, it's QoS is still governed by the IP QoS framework and there is a need for implementing QoS in ICN natively. This document describes mechanisms to classify and provide associated "name-based" extensions to identify QoS within the framework of ICN's core design principles. The name-based design provides a mechanism to carry QoS information and implement the treatments as ICN packets travel across different routers in the ICN network. Detailed discussion is provided for QoS specific procedures in each of the ICN network elements i.e. consumer, producer and forwarder.</t>
