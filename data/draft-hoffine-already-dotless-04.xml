      <t>Recent statements from the Internet Architecture Board and ICANN's Security and Stability Advisory Committee have discussed the problems that the DNS is likely to experience with top-level domains that have address records in them (so-called "dotless domains"). However, these statements spoke of the problem mostly as theoretical, when in fact there are such TLDs today. This document lists the current dotless TLDs, and gives a script for finding them. This document lists data about dotless TLDs, but does not address the policy and technology issues other than to point to the statements of others.</t>
