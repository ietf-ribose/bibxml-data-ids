    <abstract>
      <t>In certain networks deployment scenarios, service providers would like to keep all the existing MPLS functionalities in both MPLS and GMPLS while removing the complexity of existing signaling protocols such as LDP and RSVP-TE. PCE has been proposed to be used as a central controller (PCECC) so that LSP can be calculated/setup/ initiated and label forwarding entries are downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network devices along the path while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much as possible. This draft specify the procedures and PCEP protocol extensions for using the PCE as the central controller, where LSPs are calculated/setup/initiated and label forwarding entries are downloaded through extending PCEP.</t>
