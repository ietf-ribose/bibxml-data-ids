      <t>This document specifies the transition requirements for an IPv6 Customer Edge (CE) router. Specifically, this document extends the "Basic Requirements for IPv6-only Customer Edge Routers" ([RFC7084]) in order to allow the provisioning of IPv6 transition services for the hosts attached to it. The document covers several transition technologies, either for delivering IPv6 in IPv4-only access networks and specially for delivering IPv4 "as-a-service" as required in a world where IPv4 addresses are no longer available, so hosts in the customer LANs with IPv4-only or IPv6-only applications or devices, requiring to communicate with IPv4-only services at the Internet, are able to do so.</t>
