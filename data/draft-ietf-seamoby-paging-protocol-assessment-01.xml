      <t>The Seamoby Working Group has been working toward specification of an IP-level protocol for Dormant Mode Host Alerting (DMHA), sometimes known as IP-paging or simply paging (the terms IP-DMHA, DMHA, IP Paging, and Paging will be used interchangeably in this document). A problem statement and requirements have been developed, and in response to a request for protocol submissions, five protocols were submitted.</t>
