      <t>Stateless DHCPv6 service is used by hosts to obtain configuration information such as the addresses of DNS servers that does not require the maintenance of any dynamic state for individual clients. A host that uses stateless DHCP must have obtained its IPv6 addresses through some other mechanism, typically stateless address autoconfiguration. This document is a guide to the protocol messages and options that must be implemented to provide stateless DHCPv6 service.</t>
