      <t>This document defines a simple protocol - Trivial Object Transfer and Exchange (TOTE) - that provides bidirectional exchange of MIME objects over a TCP connection. It is used in conjunction with protocols based on the offer/answer model, such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). TOTE can be used for any application requiring direct agent-to-agent data communication, such as picture exchange or camera controls.</t>
