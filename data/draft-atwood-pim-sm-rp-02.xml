      <t>The Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) protocol uses a core-based tree to forward multicast datagrams to members of a multicast group. Currently there is no method for relocating the core or Rendezvous Point (RP) for a group. Administratively chosen RP's lead to low performance as the sources and receivers in the multicast group join and leave the group. This draft presents a mechanism for dynamically relocating the RP to a position that minimizes the tree cost and improves performance.</t>
