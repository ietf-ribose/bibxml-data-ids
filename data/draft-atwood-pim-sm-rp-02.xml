      <t>The Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) protocoluses a core-based tree to forward multicast datagrams to members ofa multicast group. Currently there is no method for relocating thecore or Rendezvous Point (RP) for a group. Administratively chosenRP's lead to low performance as the sources and receivers in themulticast group join and leave the group.This draft presents a mechanism for dynamically relocating the RP toa position that minimizes the tree cost and improves performance.</t>
