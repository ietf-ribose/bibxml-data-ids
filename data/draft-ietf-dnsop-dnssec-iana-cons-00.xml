      <t>This document changes the review requirements needed to get some DNSSEC algorithms and resource records added to IANA registries. It updates RFC 6014 to include hash algorithms for DS records and NSEC3 parameters. It also updates RFC 5155 and RFC 6014, which have requirements for DNSSEC algorithms. It also updates RFC 8624 to say that algorithms that are described in RFCs that are not on standards track are only at the "MAY" level of implementation recommendation.</t>
