    <abstract>
      <t>A communication network includes an access network segment that delivers data to/from the users and an associated core network segment providing connectivity with the application servers. Multiconnectivity scenarios are common where an end-user device can simultaneously connect to multiple communication networks based on different technology implementations and network architectures like WiFi, LTE, DSL. A smart selection and combination of access and core network paths that can dynamically adapt to changing network conditions can improve quality of experience for a user in such a Multiconnectivity scenario and improve overall network utilization and efficiency. This document presents the problem statement and proposes solution principles. It specifies the requirements and reference architecture for a multi-access management services framework that can be used to flexibly select the best combination of access and core network paths for uplink and downlink, as well as the flexible usage of uplink and downlink, ensuring better network efficiency and enhanced application performance.</t>
