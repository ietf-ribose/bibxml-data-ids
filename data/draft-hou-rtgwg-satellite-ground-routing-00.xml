    <abstract>
      <t>With the development of network technology, the satellite network are gradually integrating with the terrestrial network. This draft illustrates a satellite ground routing architecture based on access satellite prediction to solve the end-to-end communication issue in the satellite ground integration scenario where the connection between terrestrial nodes and satellites switches frequently. This architecture includes registration nodes which are responsible for maintaining access node information. Each access node preserve satellite orbit information, performs access satellite prediction, and generates encapsulation addresses. The access satellite undertakes data encapsulation, data forwarding, and data unencapsulation based on encapsulation addresses.</t>
