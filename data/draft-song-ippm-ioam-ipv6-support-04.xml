    <abstract>
      <t>IOAM pre-allocated trace option data fields can be encapsulated in IPv6 HbH options header as described in RFC9486. However, due to the potential large size of the trace data and the HbH extension header location in the IPv6 packets, the scheme creates practical challenges for implementation, especially when other extension headers, such as a routing header, also exist and require on-path processing. We propose two alternative approaches to address this challenge in addition to IOAM DEX: separating the IOAM incremental trace data from the IOAM instruction header, and applying the segment IOAM trace data export scheme, based on the network scenario and application requirements. We discuss the pros and cons of each approach in this document.</t>
