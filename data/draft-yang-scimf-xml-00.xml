      <t>The purpose of the Security Components Message Exchange Format (SCIMF) is to define data formats and exchange procedures for sharing information of security components, and for the management systems which may need to interact with each other. This Internet-Draft describes a data model to represent information exported by alert-make systems, and explains the rationale for using this model. An implementation of the data model in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) is presented, an XML Document Type Definition is developed, and examples are provided.</t>
