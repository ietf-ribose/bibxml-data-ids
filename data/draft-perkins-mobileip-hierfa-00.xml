      <t>The base mobile-IP specification allows mobile computers to move freely between various points of attachment to the Internet. However, each time the mobile computer moves, a Registration Request message has to be approved by the mobile node's Home Agent. In cases where the home agent is far away, it may become too expensive or (in the cases of network partition) even impossible to complete these frequent registrations. In this draft document, we specify a new variety of registration, using a Regional Registration Request and Regional Registration Reply, that is no longer always required to be transacted with the home agent.</t>
