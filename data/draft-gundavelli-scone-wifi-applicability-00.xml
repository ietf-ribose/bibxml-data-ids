    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the applicability of the Standard Communication with Network Elements (SCONE) protocol to IEEE 802.11 based access networks. SCONE defines a mechanism by which an on-path network element can provide advisory downlink throughput guidance to QUIC endpoints. The SCONE protocol is access agnostic and does not assume any specific access technology. In IEEE 802.11 deployments, such constraints may be derived at access points or controllers that combine policy awareness, with visibility into access network conditions. This document explains how existing SCONE roles and throughput advice semantics apply in these deployments without assuming any specific IEEE 802.11 MAC or PHY behavior. This document does not define new protocol extensions and does not modify SCONE behavior. Its purpose is to clarify deployment considerations for IEEE 802.11 environments.</t>
