      <t>This document defines route optimization protocol for Proxy Mobile IPv6. Proxy home test, concurrent proxy care-of test and handover procedures based on Enhanced Route Optimization for Mobile IPv6 are explained. Mobile access gateway uses cryptographically generated home addresses so that no more home test is needed after the initial home test. Handover home keygen token is used during handover in order to eliminate home test for the next mobile access gateway. The protocol also supports IPv4 transport network operation.</t>
