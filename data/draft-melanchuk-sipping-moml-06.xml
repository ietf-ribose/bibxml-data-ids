      <t>The Media Objects Markup Language (MOML) is a modular and extensible language to define media processing objects which execute on media servers. The base language defines a set of primitive media objects (called primitives) and provides tools to group primitives together and specify how they interact with each other. Clients use the base MOML, or extend MOML, to create precisely tailored media processing objects which may be used as parts of application interactions with users or conferences or to transform media flowing internal to a media server. IVR is an example of an application interaction with a user.</t>
