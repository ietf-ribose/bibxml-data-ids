      <t>Load balancing is a powerful tool for engineering traffic across a network and has been successfully used in MPLS as described in "The Use of Entropy Labels in MPLS Forwarding". With the emergence of MPLS Network Actions (MNA), there is signficant benefit in being able to invoke the same load balancing capabilities within the more general MNA infrastructure. This document describes a network action for entropy to be used in conjunction with [I-D.ietf-mpls-mna-hdr].</t>
