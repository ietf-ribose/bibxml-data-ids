      <t>Consider a situation which will arise in many IPv6 transition scenarios, where Network A, to which a host is attached, supports one IP version, but the host and Network B support a different IP version. Suppose that the host wishes to access a multicast group which is rooted or sourced in Network B. This document specifies a stateful translation mechanism whereby the host can obtain its desired access using the native multicast capabilities of Network A.</t>
