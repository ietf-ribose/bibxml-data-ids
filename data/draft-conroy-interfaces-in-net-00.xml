      <t>The plethora of networks comprising the Internet have been getting bigger and faster in the past at a tremendous rate. In the future, to address all of the current and future pervasive services, the Internet will also have to get better, i.e. it will need more intelligence created by clever software deployed throughout the network. This Internet Draft advances the discussion on the issues involved in interconnecting the Internet and Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTNs), focusing on potential interfaces between Internet-based devices and Intelligent Network (I.N.) devices. Services based on the interplay of PSTN / I.N. and the Internet are discussed and classified, and an outline of a protocol architecture for the interface between the Internet and the Intelligent Network is given.</t>
