      <t>The scenarios where Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) and Mobile IPv6(MIPv6) protocols interact with each other need specialconsiderations. An analysis of all the scenarios that involve thisinteraction is necessary in order to provide guidelines to PMIPv6protocol design and applicability. This document describes allidentified possible scenarios, which require an interaction betweenPMIPv6 and MIPv6 and discusses all issues related to these scenarios.Solutions to enable these scenarios are also described.Requirements LanguageThe key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</t>
