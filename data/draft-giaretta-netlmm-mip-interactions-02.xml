      <t>The scenarios where Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) and Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) protocols interact with each other need special considerations. An analysis of all the scenarios that involve this interaction is necessary in order to provide guidelines to PMIPv6 protocol design and applicability. This document describes all identified possible scenarios, which require an interaction between PMIPv6 and MIPv6 and discusses all issues related to these scenarios. Solutions to enable these scenarios are also described.Requirements Language The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</t>
