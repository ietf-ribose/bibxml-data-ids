      <t>The Application Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP] is designed to support remote storage and access of common application option, configuration and preference information. Its main benefits are in providing a way for users to gain access to personal information from any computer at a location supporting an internet connection, by keeping this information stored centrally on a server. Additionally, it allows 'kiosk' style use of computers so that users do not need to store data locally on a shared or public workstation or network computer. This specification defines a standard dataset class for personal dictionaries that would allow users to keep one or more 'user dictionaries' stored on an ACAP server for access by any ACAP-aware application that requires such information, for example any application that uses a spell checker.</t>
