      <t>The size of the global routing table is a rapidly growing problem.Several solutions have been proposed. These solutions commonlydivide the Internet into two address spaces, one for determining thedelivery location, and one to use during transit. Packets destinedfor delivery addresses are tunneled through the default-free zone(DFZ), which uses only transit addresses. For this process to work,there must be a mapping service that can supply an appropriatedestination transit address for any given delivery address. Wepresent a design for such a mapping service. We adhere to a "do noharm" design philosophy: maintain all desirable features of thecurrent architecture without negatively affecting its security orreliability. Our design aims to minimize delay and prevent loss inpacket encapsulation, minimize the number of modifications toexisting hardware, minimize the number of new devices, and keep thelevel of control traffic manageable.</t>
