      <t>This paper Discusses several points Lacking in the presentation of theIEPS Specification, and Condemns others as unwarranted mandates, whichdefines the Internet and its use as a Vehicle for WAR. The Alternative,'GWEBS', develops is a more realistic foundation that supports savinglives (Addressing the Concerns of all People in General, Regardless)during the Occurrence of some Catastrophic Event, which is the mandate it mintains regarding the Implementation of a Uniform Universal Protocolthat is the foundation for the 'Global Wide Emergency Broadcast System'that is used to Protect the lives and Livelihoods of all the Inhabitantsof Our Planet. Furthermore, this paper also addresses a more fundamentalconcern that requires the involvement of the UN (United Nations), whichwould mandate the Implementation of a World Wide Global Internet Backbone for every Country. The Development of such World Wide GlobalInfrastructure (A Global System to be sure) would guarantee uniform Access for All People, and would establish the necessary Foundation,infrastructure, as would be required for any Global Wide EmergencyBroadcast System (GWEBS) to work. In other words, this paper supports the belief that Information, and theexchange or the sharing related thereto, is just as important as theSustenance Consumed, which indeed, is the Vital Necessity used to sustain Life itself.</t>
