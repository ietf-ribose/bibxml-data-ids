      <t>This document describes the need for a WHois email address service similar to the internet domainname WHois service. Theres a need for a registered email address as opposed to non-registered email address to fight internet SPAM, as well as encouraging email use for personal, commercial and legal and all kinds of purposes.An internet user can have multiple email identities.
