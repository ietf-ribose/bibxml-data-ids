      <t>This document specifies a procedure for managing distribution lists using the directory. This is an extension of the mechanism defined in X.400. This draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as a protocol standard. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Please send comments to the authors or to the discussion group &lt;mhs-ds@mercury.udev.cdc.com&gt;. Temporary Note: This note has been updated to reflect ongoing X.400 standardisation work in this area. There is some overlap, which needs to be considered and resolved.</t>
