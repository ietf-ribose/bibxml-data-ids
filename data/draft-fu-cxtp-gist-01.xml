      <t>The CXTP specification uses basic SCTP as transport for CXTP messageexchanges between a mobile node's previous and new access routers.It also relies on a pre-established IPsec ESP transport mode tunnel.This document discusses two alternative approaches based on"persistent" associations using either SCTP streams feature or GISTprotocol. While both approaches reduce context transfer latencyduring handovers, GIST also offers more flexible transport and richersecurity properties.</t>
