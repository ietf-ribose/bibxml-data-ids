    <abstract>
      <t>This document changes the recommended default IID generation scheme for cases where SLAAC is used to generate a stable IPv6 address. It recommends using the mechanism specified in RFC7217 in such cases, and recommends embedding stable link-layer addresses in IPv6 Interface Identifiers. It formally updates RFC2464, RFC2467, RFC2470, RFC2491, RFC2492, RFC2497, RFC2590, RFC3146, RFC3572, RFC4291, RFC4338, RFC4391, RFC5072, and RFC5121, by removing the text in these RFCs that required the IPv6 Interface Identifiers to be derived from the underlying stable link-layer address, and replacing this text with recommendations consistent with those in this document. Additionally, this document updates RFC3315 by specifying additional requirements on the generation of Interface Identifiers used in Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6). It also provides advice to system administrators who employ manual configuration. This document does not change any existing recommendations concerning the use of temporary addresses as specified in RFC 4941.</t>
