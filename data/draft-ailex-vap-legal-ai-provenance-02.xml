    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the Verifiable AI Provenance (VAP) Framework, a cross-domain upper framework for cryptographically verifiable decision audit trails in high-risk AI systems, along with the Legal AI Profile (LAP), a domain-specific instantiation for legal AI and LegalTech systems. VAP defines common infrastructure including hash chain integrity, digital signatures, unified conformance levels (Bronze/Silver/Gold), external anchoring via RFC 3161 Time-Stamp Protocol and compatible transparency services (including IETF SCITT), a Completeness Invariant pattern guaranteeing no selective logging, standardized Evidence Pack format for regulatory submission, and privacy- preserving verification protocols. LAP extends VAP for the judicial AI domain, addressing unique requirements including attorney oversight verification (Human Override Coverage), three-pipeline completeness invariants for legal consultation, document generation, and fact-checking, tiered content retention with legal hold protocols for judicial discovery compliance, graduated override enforcement mechanisms, and privacy- preserving fields designed to maintain attorney-client privilege while enabling third-party auditability.</t>
