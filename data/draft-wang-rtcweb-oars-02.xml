    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a new relay-based NAT traversal architecture called OARS which could simplify the data communication process between two hosts that locates behind some non-BEHAVE compliant [RFC4787] [RFC5382] NAT devices. The key mechanism in OARS is the newly defined "Couple" message which allows the Relay servers to be easily incorporated into existing CGN/CDN nodes which are already deployed within the network in a distributed manner.
