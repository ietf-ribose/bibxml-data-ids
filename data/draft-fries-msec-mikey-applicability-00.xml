      <t>Multimedia Internet Keying - MIKEY - is a key management scheme that can be used for real-time applications. In particular, it has been defined focusing on the support of the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol. MIKEY itself defines four key distribution schemes. Moreover, it is defined to allow extensions of the protocol. As MIKEY becomes more and more accepted, extensions to the base protocol arose, especially in terms of additional key distribution schemes, but also in terms of payload enhancements. This document provides an overview about MIKEY in general as well as the existing extensions in MIKEY, which have been defined or are in the process of definition.</t>
