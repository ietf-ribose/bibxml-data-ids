      <t>This document discusses a Proxy Mobile IPv6 mobility sessionredirection functionality at the Proxy Mobile IPv6 base protocollevel. The redirection functionality would allow a Local MobilityAnchor to redirect the Mobile Access Gateway during the Proxy BindingUpdate and Acknowledgement exchange to an alternative Local MobilityAnchor. The benefit of redirection at the protocol level is that itremoves the dependence on having such functionality provided by theAuthentication, Authorization and, Accounting elements or the DomainName System in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 Domain. Furthermore, doing theredirection at the base protocol level reduces the amount ofsignaling, unnecessary costly setup of mobility sessions andunnecessary costly interactions with backend systems.</t>
