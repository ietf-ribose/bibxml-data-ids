      <t>This document defines the concept of an "origin", which represents a web principal. Typically, user agents isolate content retrieved from different origins to prevent a malicious web site operator from interfering with the operation of benign web sites. In particular, this document defines how to compute an origin from a URI, how to serialize an origin to a string, and an HTTP header, named "Origin", for indicating which origin caused the user agent to issue a particular HTTP request.</t>
