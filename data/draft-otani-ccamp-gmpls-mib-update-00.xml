    <abstract>
      <t>This memo describes the necessity of generalized multi-protocol label switching (GMPLS) management information base (MIB) family update. Since the establishment of basic GMPLS protocol specifications, additional functionalities has been proposed and standardized so far, such as recovery, call support, optical transport network (OTN) support and so forth. Coinciding with these additional specifications, GMPLS MIB family is also desired to be updated to manage GMPLS networks appropriately. This document is to clarify missing pieces in currently defined GMPLS MIB family due to the enhancement of original GMPLS protocols.</t>
