    <abstract>
      <t>This document explores how existing IETF YANG data models can be applied to support a use case involving dynamic, time-scoped UCMP (Unequal Cost Multipath) policy enforcement across multiple network segments interconnecting Edge Cloud sites. The use case is motivated by periodic, high-volume data exchanges between distributed AI inference modules placed at geographically dispersed edge data centers. By mapping network requirements such as bandwidth, latency, and availability to relevant YANG models, including AC, TE Topology, SR Policy, and QoS models, this document serves as a practical exercise to evaluate the applicability and limitations of current IETF specifications. It highlights the need for cloud-initiated, time-bounded network policy activation and identifies potential gaps in model expressiveness, policy lifecycle handling, and API-level abstraction required for real-time cloud-network coordination.</t>
