      <t>The problem of today's VoIP user agents (hardware terminals, SIP soft phones) is the need for quite a bit of manual configuration at the initialization time as well as when moving from one environment to another. The information to be configured is typically not known by the end-user. Automatic configuration of SIP user agents would release the user of these configuration tasks. This memo describes the challenges of auto-configuration of SIP user agents and gives some requirements for further discussions.</t>
