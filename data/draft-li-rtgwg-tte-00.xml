    <abstract>
      <t>Conventional traffic engineering approaches for resource management used by RSVP-TE and SR-TE often leverage estimates of the ingress traffic demands, during path placement. Unforeseen and/or dynamic events, can skew these estimates by significant enough margins to result in unexpected network congestion. Recomputed paths that address the new demands may take a considerable amount of time, leaving the network in a sub-optimal state for far too long. This document proposes one mechanism that can avert congestion on a real-time basis.</t>
