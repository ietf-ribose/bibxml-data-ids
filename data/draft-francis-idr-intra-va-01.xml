      <t>The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT)stresses the global routing system in a number of ways. One of themost costly stresses is FIB size: ISPs often must upgrade routerhardware simply because the FIB has run out of space, and routervendors must design routers that have adequate FIB. FIB suppressionis an approach to relieving stress on the FIB by NOT loading selectedRIB entries into the FIB. This document specifies two styles of FIBsuppression. Edge suppression (ES) allows ISPs that deploy a core-edge topology to shrink the FIBs of their edge routers, includingthose that interface to other ISPs and exchange the full DFRT.Virtual Aggregation (VA) allows ISPs to shrink the FIBs of any andall routers. Both styles may be deployed autonomously by an ISP(cooperation between ISPs is not required), and can co-exist withlegacy routers in the ISP.</t>
