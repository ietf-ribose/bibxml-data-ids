      <t>This memo defines a signing procedure for Japanese message in the context of security multipart. The procedure guarantees signature validity even if messages are processed through message transfer agents which carelessly transform character set encodings. To sign Japanese message digitally, local forms such as EUC/Japanese, Shift-JIS, etc., are first converted into the transfer form, ISO-2022-JP with an appropriate set of MIME headers. Then it is duplicated into two objects. The first object is transformed into the signature form defined in this memo and a detached digital signature is calculated over it. A 'Multipart/Signed' part is created with the second object and the detached digital signature. Japanese text is verified as the signature form instead of the transfer form. To encrypt Japanese message, the transfer form, ISO-2022-JP with an appropriate set of MIME headers, is used.</t>
