      <t>There are times that an LSP source node needs to know change(s) hasoccurred along the originally established LSP path. This isespecially true in the Mobile Backhaul environment where microwavetransport is widely deployed. The bandwidth provided by the microwavetransport can change with weather. The source LSR, e.g. LTE's eNodeB,needs to adjust its admission rate or shift more load to alternativepaths when the backhaul transport path condition is changed.This draft describes a simple mechanism for transit LSRs to notifySource LSR of the path condition changes.Conventions used in this documentThe key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 0.</t>
