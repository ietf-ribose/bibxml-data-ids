      <t>While IP was designed around the notion that the network would beinvisible to the applications that run on them, an increasinglycomplex service environment along with the compartmentalization of'policy' into administrative domains has led to a proliferation oftypes of middleboxes for policy enforcement, and those middleboxesare interfering with applications. Applications now need to influ-ence the behavior of middleboxes, but violating network layeringprinciples by establishing explicit communication channels fromapplications to network-layer middleboxes introduces a new set ofproblems related to topology and discovery as well as consequentproblems that ripple out from those. This paper is an introductoryexamination of whether or not there is a better way.</t>
