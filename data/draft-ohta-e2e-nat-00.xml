      <t>According to the end to end argument, NAT function can completely and correctly be implemented only with the knowledge and help of end hosts. By making NAT visible to the end hosts of NAT clients and let the hosts help NAT gateways, NAT actually becomes correct, complete, and end to end transparent. End to end NAT is upper compatible to legacy NAT while enabling various transport protocols (ICMP, SCTP, IPSEC), DNS reverse look up, Multicast and Mobile IP.</t>
