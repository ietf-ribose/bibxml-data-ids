      <t>One of the protocol instantiations the RMT WG is chartered to create is a TRee-based ACKnowledgement protocol (TRACK). Rather than create a set of monolithic protocol specifications, the RMT WG has chosen to break the reliable multicast protocols in to Building Blocks (BB) and Protocol Instantiations (PI). A Building Block is a specification of the algorithms of a single component, with an abstract interface to other BBs and PIs. A PI combines a set of BBs, adds in the additional required functionality not specified in any BB, and specifies the specific instantiation of the protocol. For more information, see the Reliable Multicast Transport Building Blocks and Reliable Multicast Design Space documents [2][3].</t>
