      <t>This document describes the potential benefits to applications when they enable Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). It outlines the principal gains in terms of increased throughput, reduced delay and other benefits when ECN is used over network paths that include equipment that supports ECN-marking. The focus of this document is on usage of ECN, not its implementation in hosts, routers and other network devices.</t>
