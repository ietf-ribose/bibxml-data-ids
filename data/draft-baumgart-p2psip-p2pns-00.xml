      <t>This document describes P2PNS, a secure distributed name service forP2PSIP. P2PNS can be used to resolve SIP AoRs to Contact URIswithout using DNS or central SIP servers. P2PNS provides severalsecurity mechanisms to efficiently prevent identity theft and toensure the uniqueness of SIP AoRs in a completely decentralized anduntrusted network without login servers. The proposed proxyarchitecture allows a seamless integration of legacy SIP UAs, avoidsmodifications to the complex SIP protocol stack and facilitates thedeployment of P2PSIP networks. Because P2PNS provides a generic nameservice it is not limited to P2PSIP but can also be used e.g. tobuild a distributed DNS system.</t>
