      <t>This document proposes the use of a scope control BGP community. This new well-known advisory transitive community is intended to allow an origin AS to specify the extent to which a specific route should be externally propagated. In particular this community, termed here as NOPEER, allows the origin AS to specify that a route with this attribute need not be advertised across bilateral peer connections.</t>
