      <t>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) enables DHCPv6 servers to configure network parameters. However, due to the unsecured nature, various critical identifiers used in DHCPv6 are vulnerable to several types of attacks, particularly pervasive monitoring. This document provides a mechanism to secure DHCPv6 messages, which achieves the client/server authentication and encryption based on sender's certificates.</t>
