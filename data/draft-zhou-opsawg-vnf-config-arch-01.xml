      <t>This document describes the architecture of remote service installation and configuration in the provider's network through a centralized management system. This is a typical scenario for virtual network function installation and dynamic configuration in network function virtualization (NFV) context. It is also a typical scenario in cloud computing environment where end users do not have to install applications on their end hosts, but can install their own featured powerful software application in the cloud. This specification describes an architecture of virtual network function installation and configuration. It is also applicable to other use cases with similar requirements.</t>
