      <t>Generic requirements for Pseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) have been described in [3]. This draft provides encapsulation formats and guidelines from transporting ATM services over a Packet Switched Network using IP, L2TP, or MPLS. It describes three cell relay services: VCC, VPC, and transparent port, as well as two methods for carrying AAL5 PDUs across a PSN.</t>
