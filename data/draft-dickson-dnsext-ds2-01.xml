      <t>The Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Extensions introduced the DS resource record (RR) for authentication of zone delegations. This document introduces an alternative resource record, DS2, which similarly provides authentication of zone delegations. However, DS2 provides a canonical signer name, for zones whose content may be duplicated with multiple owner names. The zone is signed by the canonical signer, and the DS2 record allows for validation using this signer name. Author's Note</t>
