      <t>The Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) Extensions introduced the DSresource record (RR) for authentication of zone delegations. Thisdocument introduces an alternative resource record, DS2, whichsimilarly provides authentication of zone delegations. However, DS2provides a canonical signer name, for zones whose content may beduplicated with multiple owner names. The zone is signed by thecanonical signer, and the DS2 record allows for validation using thissigner name.Author's Note</t>
