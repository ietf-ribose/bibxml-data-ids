      <t>Internet storage services have become more and more popular. They attract a huge number of users and produce a significant share of Internet traffic. Most existing Internet storage services make use of proprietary sync protocols with different capabilities to achieve the data sync. However, a single Internet storage service using its proprietary sync protocols has intrinsic limitations on service usability and network performance. This document outlines the related problems caused by using proprietary sync protocols and missing key capabilities. It also shows a demand for designing a standard sync protocol to achieve better usability and sync performance.</t>
