      <t>This document describes an extension to the SMTP service [RFC1425], called Extended DATA Reply. This is an extended format of the SMTP response to the DATA verb which provides recipient-specific status information. This allows mail recipients to use individual mail filters as part of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. This is a very desirable feature because of escalating amounts of unwanted junk E- mail sent over the Internet.</t>
