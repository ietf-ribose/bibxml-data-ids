    <abstract>
      <t>This document focuses on developing a key expansion method based on the internet X.509 public key infrastructure and elliptic curve cryptography, which is applied in the context of anonymous voting. The method enables end entities to maintain anonymity from other end entities, the registration authority, and the certificate authority, while still allowing the validity of end entity certificates to be verified, thereby facilitating anonymous voting services.</t>
