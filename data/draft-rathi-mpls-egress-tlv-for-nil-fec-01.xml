      <t>Segment routing supports the creation of explicit paths using adjacency- sids, node-sids, and anycast-sids. The SR-TE paths are built by stacking the labels that represent the nodes and links in the explicit path. A very useful Operations And Maintenance (OAM) requirement is to be able to ping and trace these paths. A simple mpls ping/traceroute mechanism comprises of ability to traverse the SR-TE path without having to validate the control plane state. This document describes mpls ping and traceroute procedures using Nil FEC with additional extensions.</t>
