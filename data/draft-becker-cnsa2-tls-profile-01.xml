    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a base profile of TLS 1.3 for use with the U.S. Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) 2.0 Suite, a cybersecurity advisory published by the United States Government which outlines quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithm policy for U.S. national security applications. This profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of U.S. National Security Systems that employ TLS 1.3. It is also appropriate for all other U.S. Government systems that process high-value information. This profile is made publicly available for use by developers and operators of these and any other system deployments.</t>
