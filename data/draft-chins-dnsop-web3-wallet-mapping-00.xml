      <t>This document proposes a standard for mapping wallets to domain names using TXT records. The goal is to provide a secure and scalable way to associate wallets with domain names, enabling seamless lookup as well as assisting in authentication. The proposal heavily uses DNSSEC to ensure security. We also will propose a mechanism for mapping a wallet back to a domain name.</t>
