      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols. It describes the use of information provided by Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) services, such as the Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS), to dynamically update user-to-group mappings in the View-Based Access Control Model (VACM). Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at isms@ietf.org.</t>
