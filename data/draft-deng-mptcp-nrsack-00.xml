    <abstract>
      <t>Multipath Transmission Control Protocol (MPTCP) [RFC6824] adopts Selective Acknowledgements (SACKs) at the subflow level to allow an MPTCP receiver to acknowledge the receipt of out-of-order data. In MPTCP, SACK information is expected (but not mandated)--though SACKs notify a data sender the reception of specific out-of-order data, the out-of-order data cannot be delivered to application layer until it has been cumulatively acknowledged at the connection-level. The MPTCP data receiver is permitted to later abandon the out-of-order data cached in the receive buffer. The out-of-order data is called renegable. Since the delivery of a SACKed out-of-order data is renegable, the sender has to maintain copies of SACKed data in the send buffer until it is cumulatively acked. As a result, the send buffer is inevitably wasted and the transmission rate is restricted even though the network is not congested.</t>
