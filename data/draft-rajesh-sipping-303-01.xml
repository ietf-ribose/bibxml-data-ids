      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows for sessions to be redirected by the use of the 3xx response code. This response code allows redirect servers and proxies to redirect the session or for the message to be sent all the way back to the initiating client to recurse. There is no way to direct the domain responsible for the Request-URI to perform the redirection. This document defines a new response code that clients and redirect servers could use to ensure that recursion take place within the domain responsible for the Request-URI rather than allowing the initiating client do perform the redirect.</t>
