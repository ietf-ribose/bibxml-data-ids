      <t>It is common operator practice to mitigate security risks by enforcing appropriate packet filtering. This document analyzes both the general security implications of IPv6 Extension Headers and the specific security implications of each Extension Header and Option type, and provides advice on the filtering of IPv6 packets based on the IPv6 Extension Headers and the IPv6 options they contain. Additionally, it discusses the operational and interoperability implications of discarding packets based on the IPv6 Extension Headers and IPv6 options they contain.</t>
