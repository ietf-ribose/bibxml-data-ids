      <t>This document specifies how to carry colored path advertisement via an enhancement to the existing protocol BGP Label Unicast. It would allow backward compatibility with RFC8277. The targeted solution is to use stack of labels advertised via BGP Label Unicast 2.0 for end to end traffic steering across multiple IGP domains. The operation is similar to Segment Routing. This proposed protocol will convey the necessary reachability information to the ingress PE node to construct an end to end path</t>
