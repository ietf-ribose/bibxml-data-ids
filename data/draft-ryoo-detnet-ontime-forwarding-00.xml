      <t>This document describes operations of data plane and controller plane for Deterministic Networking (DetNet) to forward packets to meet minimum and maximum end-to-end latency requirements, while utilizing Push-In First-Out (PIFO) queue. According to the solution described in this document, forwarding nodes do not need to maintain flow states or to be time-synchronized with each other.</t>
