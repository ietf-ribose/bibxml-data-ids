      <t>RFC 5586 defines a Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh) mechanism for MPLS paths that enables multiplexing of auxiliary traffic over such paths along with the user traffic they carry. Such auxiliary traffic is commonly used for Operations, Administration, and Maintenance protocols that enable monitoring and management of the path. This document describes the applicability of the G-ACh mechanism to Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) tunnels.</t>
