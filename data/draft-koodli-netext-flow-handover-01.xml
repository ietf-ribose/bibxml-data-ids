      <t>With interface multihoming, Mobile Nodes are capable of simultaneousattachment to multiple radio access networks. This enables a networknode such as the Local Mobility Anchor to distribute the applicationtraffic to interfaces that can best serve them. This documentspecifies a network-controlled protocol to handover application flowsfrom one interface to another. Such control could provide betterexperience for end users and better traffic management for networkoperators.</t>
