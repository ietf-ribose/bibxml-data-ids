      <t>This document defines a claim set for recording AI content refusal events. The claim set specifies the semantic content and correlation rules for refusal audit trails, independent of any particular serialization format. The claims are designed to be carried within SCITT Signed Statements and verified using SCITT Receipts. This specification addresses claim semantics and verification requirements; it does not mandate a specific encoding. A CDDL definition is provided for CBOR-based implementations, and equivalent JSON representations are shown in an appendix for illustration. This specification provides auditability of logged refusal decisions. It does not define content moderation policies, classification criteria, or what AI systems should refuse.</t>
