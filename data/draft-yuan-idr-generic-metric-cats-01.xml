    <abstract>
      <t>Steering traffic for computing-related services considering computing resources and circumstances is discussed in CATS WG. Correspondingly, publishing services and updating computing conditions turns out to be a significant issue. It SHOULD be realized that multiple same common metrics are required from both network and service instances in order to evaluate overall performance and further achieve and fulfill appropriate traffic steering and scheduling. Therefore, an implementation for distributed CATS with generic metrics delivery and distribution based on BGP is proposed and discussed in this draft.</t>
