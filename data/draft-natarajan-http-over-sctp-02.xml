      <t>Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] requires a reliabletransport for end-to-end communication. While historically TCP hasbeen used for this purpose, this document proposes an alternative --the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960]. Similarto TCP, SCTP offers a reliable end-to-end transport connection toapplications. Additionally, SCTP offers innovative servicesunavailable in TCP. This draft (i) specifies HTTP over SCTP'smultistreaming service, (ii) lists open issues warranting morediscussion and/or investigation, and (iii) shares some lessonslearned from implementing HTTP over SCTP. Finally, this documenthighlights SCTP services that better match HTTP's needs than TCP.</t>
