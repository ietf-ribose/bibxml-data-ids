      <t>Targeted LDP (t-LDP) Hellos are used for establishing adjacencies with non-directly connected peers. After an LDP session is established to a Targeted Peer, there are deployment scenerios where it is not necessary to send Targeted LDP Hellos at the configured intervals. This document proposes a mechanism to turn off or reduce the rate of exchange of Targeted LDP Hellos after LDP session is established to a peer.</t>
