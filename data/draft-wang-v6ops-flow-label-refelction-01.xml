      <t>IPv6 Flow Label field in IPv6 packet header is designed to differentiate the various traffic flow session within network. The current definition of IPv6 Flow Label focuses mainly on how the packet source forms the value of this field and how the forwarder in-path treats it. There is no analysis on the relation between the flow label from source nodes and its corresponding value in return packet. This draft analyzes the requirements for flow label reflection between the upstream session and the corresponding downstream session. Based on the analysis, the flow label reflection mechanism is proposed in this document.</t>
