    <abstract>
      <t>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) makes use of signed objects called manifests. A manifest lists each file that an issuer intends to include within an RPKI repository, and can be used to detect certain forms of attack against a repository. Manifests include a "manifest number" (manifestNumber), which an issuer must increment whenever it issues a new manifest, and Relying Parties (RPs) are required to verify that a newly-retrieved manifest for a given Certification Authority (CA) has a higher manifestNumber than the previously-validated manifest. However, the manifestNumber field is 20 octets in length (i.e. bounded), and no behaviour is specified for when a manifestNumber reaches the largest possible value. This document updates [RFC9286] by specifying issuer and RP behaviour for this scenario.</t>
