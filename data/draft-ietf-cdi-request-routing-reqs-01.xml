      <t>Request-routing systems (RRS) are components of Content Distribution Networks (CDNs) that direct client requests to an available copy of content based on one or more metrics. To enable the interconnection of CDNs [MODEL][ARCH], it is necessary for their request-routing systems to interconnect and exchange information such that client requests can be routed between CDNs. This is called request-routing internetworking. This document specifies the requirements for request-routing internetworking.</t>
