      <t>An important component of presence and location services is policy.Policy systems allow the presentity or location target to grantaccess to specific pieces of information to specific watchers orrequestors. These policy systems can be extremely simple, allowing auser to accept or block requests based solely on the identity of therequestor, to extremely complex, allowing for time based rules thatgrant or deny specific pieces of information. Policy systems oftensupport vendor proprietary features. To allow for interoperabilitybetween clients which set such policies, and servers which executethem, it is necessary for clients to be able to determine thecapabilities of the server to which it is connected. Thisspecification defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) basedformat for expressing such capabilities.</t>
