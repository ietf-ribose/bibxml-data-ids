      <t>We analyze the requirement to compress the headers of RTP data streams. It is argued that there is a need to define two different compression schemes: an 'interim solution' in which only RTP headers are compressed, and a 'complete solution' which compresses the RTP/UDP/IP headers only across serial links. It is argued that the complete solution must include a new 'guaranteed header compression service,' if it is to be useful. The two solutions are described, along with a transition strategy which ensures that only the complete solution will be used when this is possible.</t>
