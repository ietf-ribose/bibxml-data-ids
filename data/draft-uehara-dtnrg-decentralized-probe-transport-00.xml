      <t>(This document is a description of the decentralized viechle toviechle probe mechanism currently being prototyped. The main purposeof disclosing this -00 document is to introduce the application ideaand start discussion within the DTNRG. Because of this, the currentmechanism described in this docment does not conform to the protocolsdefined in the DTNRG at this moment. The mechanism should be updatedbased on the discussion in this group.)This document describes the transport protocol specification used forthe decentralized probe system for vehicles. The probe systemexchanges probe messages between vehicles using a wirelesscommunication methods with low bandwidth and lossy properties. Thecommunication environment dynamically changes as vehicle moves. Theprotocol try to utilize the limited bandwidth as much as possible andincrease reachability rate by using sender-side error correctionmechanism.</t>
