      <t>This document attempts to identify the requirements for a protocol framework to provide SIP user and device profiles to SIP user agents. The objective is not to invent new special purpose protocols, but to identify the requirements such that a rational decision can be made as to what existing protocol(s) should be used to solve the problem of providing user and device profiles to SIP user agents. This document also contains an evaluation of a set of applicable protocols.</t>
