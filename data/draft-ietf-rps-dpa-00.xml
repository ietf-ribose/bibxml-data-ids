      <t>Ripe-181 [2] is a language to specify routing policy constraints for inter-domain routing in the Internet. Ripe-181 allows the specification of both import policy constraints (by specifying as-in and interas-in attributes) and export policy constraints (by specifying as-out and interas-out attributes). The Destination Preference Attribute (DPA) [3] is recently added to the BGP [4] routing protocol. This attribute can be used by an autonomous system (AS) to specify a globally transitive preference in its routing announcement via BGP so that the upstream BGP speakers can use this preference to favor certain path for return traffic. This document extends Ripe-181 to enable the setting of the DPA attribute during route announcements. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with BGP, DPA and Ripe-181.</t>
