      <t>This document describes a transparent virtual LAN service (VLS) solution over MPLS, sometimes known as Transparent LAN Services (TLS). VLS simulates an Ethernet virtual 802.1d bridge [6] [7] for a given set of users. It delivers a layer 2 broadcast domain that is fully capable of learning and forwarding on Ethernet MAC addresses that is closed to a given set of users. Many VLS services can be supported from a single PE node.</t>
