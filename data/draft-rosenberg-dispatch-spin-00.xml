      <t>This document introduces a framework and a protocol for facilitating voice, video and messaging interoperability between application providers. This work is motivated by the recent passage of regulation in the European Union - the Digital Markets Act (DMA) - which, amongst many other provisions, requires that vendors of applications with a large number of users enable interoperability with applications made by other vendors. While such interoperability is broadly present within the public switched telephone network, it is not yet commonplace between over-the-top applications, such as Facetime, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger. This document specifically defines the Simple Protocol for Inviting Numbers (SPIN) which is used to deliver invitations to mobile phone numbers that can bootstrap subsequent communications over the Internet.</t>
