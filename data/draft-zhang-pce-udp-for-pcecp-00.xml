      <t>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol defines a request/response protocol used for the communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or between two PCEs. PCEP employs Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) as the transport layer protocol by using a registered TCP port. This document proposes the possibility of employing UDP as the transport layer protocol instead of TCP. UDP is a connectionless protocol within TCP/IP protocol suite that corresponds to the transport layer in the ISO/OSI reference model. UDP converts data messages generated by an application into packets to be sent through IP. The reliability is not guaranteed by UDP and should be ensured by the application that generates the data message. The PCECP application is flexible to ensure the reliability of PCECP messages. This document explains on how the reliability of the PCECP messages can be achieved by means of PCECP, while operating PCECP over UDP.</t>
