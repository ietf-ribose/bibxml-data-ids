      <t>GMPLS provides control for multiple switching technologies and for hierarchical switching within a technology. GMPLS routing and signaling use common values to indicate the type of switching technology. These values are carried in routing protocols via the Switching Capability field, and in signaling protocols via the Switching Type field. While the values used in these fields are the primary indicators of the technology and hierarchy level being controlled, the values are not consistently defined and used across the different technologies supported by GMPLS. This document is intended to resolve the inconsistent definition and use of the Switching Capability and Type fields by narrowly scoping the meaning and use of the fields. This document updates all documents that use the GMPLS Switching Capability and Types fields, in particular RFCs 3471, 4202, 4203, and 5307.</t>
