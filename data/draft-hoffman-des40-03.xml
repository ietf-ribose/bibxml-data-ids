      <t>This document describes an method for shortening DES keys from 56 bitsto 40 bits. The shortened keys are generally known as 'DES-40'. Themotivation for this weakening is that some localities (such as theUnited States) give special preference to applications that use 40-bitkeys. The weakened keys are then used with the DES encryptionalgorithm in the same manner as full-strength keys. There are many possible methods for reducing a 56-bit key to a 40-bitkey. The method in this draft was chosen because one method is neededfor interoperability. Further, this method has been known tooccasionally have been approved for export from the United States.</t>
