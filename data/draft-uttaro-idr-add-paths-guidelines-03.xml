      <t>Add-Paths is a BGP enhancement that allows a BGP router to advertisemultiple distinct paths for the same prefix/NLRI. This provides anumber of potential benefits, including reduced routing churn, fasterconvergence and better loadsharing.This document provides recommendations to implementers of Add-Pathsso that network operators have the tools needed to address theirspecific applications and to manage the scalability impact of Add-Paths. A router implementing Add-Paths may learn many paths for aprefix and must decide which of these to advertise to peers. Thisdocument analyses different algorithms for making this selection andprovides recommendations based on the target application.</t>
