      <t>This document defines service controls that extend the LDAPv3 [LDAP]operations to provide a simple mechanism by which an LDAP client canselect master or replica directory information, controlchaining and specify other service requirements when connected to anX.500 directory service. These service control mechanisms are notrequired when LDAP clients are connected to a single(non X.500) LDAPserver because, for example, chaining [X.518]is not supported by theseservers.Chaining protocols (DSP in X.500) also permit the extraction ofmaster or replica data from within the X.500 directory system andprovide this to the client (via LDAP) without the need for client basedLDAP referrals to different servers. In addition, the controls proposed provide major step in the 'control'alignment of LDAP and DAP and their use of X.500. This will permitfunctional consistency to be achieved in directory enabled applicationsthat use LDAP for access. In order to distinguish this functionality from LDAP V3 capable systems,an upgrade to LDAP V4 is also proposed.The key words 'MUST', 'MUST NOT', 'REQUIRED', 'SHALL', 'SHALL NOT','SHOULD', 'SHOULD NOT', 'RECOMMENDED', and 'MAY' in this document areto be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [KEYWORDS].</t>
