    <abstract>
      <t>A Cryptographically Generated Address is an IPv6 addresses binding with a public/private key pair. However, the current CGA specifications are lack of procedures to enable proper management of the usage of CGAs. This document analyzes the parameters required for the generation of CGA from network configuration and management perspective. The configuration procedures of many CGA-relevant parameters with existing mechanisms are described in the document. Only Sec value has no suitable mechanism to be configured by network admin. A new DHCPv6 option is defined accordingly. This document also analyses the configuration of the parameters, which are used to generate CGAs, using DHCPv6. Although the document does not define new DHCPv6 option to carry these parameters for various reasons, the configuration procedure is described.</t>
