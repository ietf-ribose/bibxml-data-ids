      <t>This document describes the interaction between systems sending multi-part Internet mail [2] to systems that cannot render parts of the sent message. In particular, this document describes an extension to the Delivery Status Notification mechanism described in [3]. An example of partial message delivery failure is the case when a user sends an audio file and a video file to an Internet Voice Mail [4] system. The Internet Voice Mail system can render the audio part but not the video part. In this case, a partial delivery occurs. This document reflects work undertaken in support of the Internet Voice Mail and Voice Profile for Internet Mail [5] initiatives. The VPIM Work Group home page is &lt;http://www.ema.org/vpim&gt;.</t>
