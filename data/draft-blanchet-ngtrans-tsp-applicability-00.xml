      <t>There are multiple environments where IPv6 transition techniques can be used. There are multiple IPv6 transition techniques. This document describes the applicability of transition techniques based on the Tunnel Setup Protocol(TSP) used in different environments, such as: provider, enterprise, unmanaged networks, cable-dsl operators, wireless operators, mobile hosts and networks. TSP enables the automation of prefix assignment, DNS delegation and routing preferences. TSP supports IPv6 over IPv4 and IPv4 over IPv6 encapsulations, as well as UDP-IPv4 encapsulation for IPv4 NAT traversals, through automatic NAT discovery.</t>
