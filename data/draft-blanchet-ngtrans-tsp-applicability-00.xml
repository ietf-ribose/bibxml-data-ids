      <t>There are multiple environments where IPv6 transition techniques canbe used. There are multiple IPv6 transition techniques. Thisdocument describes the applicability of transition techniques basedon the Tunnel Setup Protocol(TSP) used in different environments,such as: provider, enterprise, unmanaged networks, cable-dsloperators, wireless operators, mobile hosts and networks. TSPenables the automation of prefix assignment, DNS delegation androuting preferences. TSP supports IPv6 over IPv4 and IPv4 over IPv6encapsulations, as well as UDP-IPv4 encapsulation for IPv4 NATtraversals, through automatic NAT discovery.</t>
