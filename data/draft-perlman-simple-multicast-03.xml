      <t>This paper describes a design for multicast that is simple to understand and low enough overhead for routers that a single scheme can work both within and between domains. It also eliminates the need for coordinated multicast address allocation across the Internet. It is not very different from the tree-based schemes CBT, PIM-SM, and BGMP. Essentially all of the mechanisms to support this have already been implemented in the other designs. The contribution of this protocol is in what is NOT required to be implemented. The main idea for simplifying multicast is to consider the identity of a group to be the 8-byte combination of a</t>
