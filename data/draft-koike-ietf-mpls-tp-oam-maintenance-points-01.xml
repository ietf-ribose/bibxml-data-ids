      <t>MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is designed to enable carrier grade packet transport and complement converged packet network deployments. Among the most important features of MPLS-TP are comprehensive OAM functions which enable network operators or service providers to provide various kinds of service characteristics such as prompt fault location, substantial survivability, performance monitoring and preliminary or in-service measurements. For the realization of those features by the MPLS Transport Profile, the definition of the maintenance points at which OAM messages are initiated, terminated and processed is very important. Based on the MPLS-TP OAM requirements this document elaborates on and gives guidance about maintenance points in MPLS-TP networks. This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.</t>
