      <t>This draft describes an optional extension to IS-IS protocol, usedtoday by several ISPs for routing within their clouds. IS-IS is aninterior gateway routing protocol developed originally by OSI andused with IP extensions as IGP. IS-IS originally does not provideCSNP and PSNP checksums, relying on the underlying layers to verifythe integrity of information provided. Experience with the protocolshows that this precondition does not always hold and scenarioscan be imagined that impact protocol functionality. This documentintroduces a new optional TLV providing checksums.</t>
