    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies requirements for algorithms that make ICE connectivity checks more responsive by reducing delays in dual-stack host ICE connectivity checks when there is a path failure for the address family preferred by the application or by the operating system. As IPv6 is usually preferred, the procedures in this document helps avoid user-noticeable delays when the IPv6 path is broken or excessively slow.</t>
