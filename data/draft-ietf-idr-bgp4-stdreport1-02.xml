      <t>The purpose of this memo is to document how the requirements for advancing a routing protocol to Full Standard have been satisfied by Border Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGP-4) (and create needless busywork). This report provides a roadmap to all information necessary to move BGP-4 to Standard. This is the first of two final reports on the BGP protocol. As required by the Internet Activities Board (IAB) and the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), the second report will present additional knowledge and understanding gained in the time when the protocol was mada a Draft standard and when it was submitted for Standard. The remaining sections of this memo document how BGP satisfies General Requirements specified in Section 3.0, as well as Requirements for Standard specified in Section 6.0 of the 'Internet Routing Protocol Standardization Criteria' document [1]. Please send comments to bgp@ans.net.</t>
