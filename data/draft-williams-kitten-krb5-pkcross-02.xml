      <t>This document specifies a protocol for obtaining cross-realm Kerberos tickets using existing, related protocols: kerberized certification authorities (kx509) and public key cryptography initial authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT). The resulting protocol has a number of desirable security properties, including privacy protection for the user relative to their home realm's infrastructure, as well a support for leap-of-faith trust establishment, and automated cross- realm keying. This protocol allows Kerberos to scale to large numbers of realms.</t>
