      <t>BGP routing protocol defined in ([RFC4271]) employs tie-breaking logic to elect single best path among multiple possible. At the same time, it has been common in virtually all BGP implementations to allow for "equal-cost multipath" (ECMP) election and programming of multiple next-hops in routing tables. This documents summarizes some common considerations for the ECMP logic, with the intent of providing common reference on otherwise unstandardized feature.</t>
