      <t>This document defines a set of methods for Node-specific operations as part of the REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) protocol. This document defines NodeFetch, NodeStore, and NodeRemove methods that allows manipuation of Node specific usage data. These methods will be useful for multiple diagnostic, administrative, and discovery usages. Because of their usefulness for a variety of expected usages, these methods are advanced for inclusion in the base RELOAD protocol.</t>
