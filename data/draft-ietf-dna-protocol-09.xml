    <abstract>
      <t>In this memo, a mechanism that was developed for detection of network attachement is documented for future reference. This memo is an informational document and thus does not define a new standard. The mechanism proposed in this experimental RFC requires the hosts to monitor all the prefixes advertised on the link and use it for link identification in the presence of non-DNAv6 routers is presented. A more efficient link-identification mechanism requiring the DNAv6 routers to monitor the link for advertised prefixes to assist the hosts in link identification combined with a fast router advertisement mechanism that selects the order of response for the router deterministically is also presented.</t>
