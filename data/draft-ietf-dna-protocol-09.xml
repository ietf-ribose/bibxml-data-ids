      <t>In this memo, a mechanism that was developed for detection of networkattachement is documented for future reference. This memo is aninformational document and thus does not define a new standard. Themechanism proposed in this experimental RFC requires the hosts tomonitor all the prefixes advertised on the link and use it for linkidentification in the presence of non-DNAv6 routers is presented. Amore efficient link-identification mechanism requiring the DNAv6routers to monitor the link for advertised prefixes to assist thehosts in link identification combined with a fast routeradvertisement mechanism that selects the order of response for therouter deterministically is also presented.</t>
