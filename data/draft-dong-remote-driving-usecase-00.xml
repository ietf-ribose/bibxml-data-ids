    <abstract>
      <t>This document illustrates the use case of remote driving that leverages the human driver's advanced perceptual and cognitive skills to enhance autonomous driving when it is absent or falls short. Specifically the document analyzes the end-to-end latency that is required in the network to support collision avoidance in remote driving. The document also summarizes the other necessary requirements that the networking services shall support.</t>
