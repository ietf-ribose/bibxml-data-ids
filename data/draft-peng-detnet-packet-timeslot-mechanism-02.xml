    <abstract>
      <t>IP/MPLS networks use packet switching (with the feature store-and- forward) and are based on statistical multiplexing. Statistical multiplexing is essentially a variant of time division multiplexing, which refers to the asynchronous and dynamic allocation of link timeslot resources. In this case, the service flow does not occupy a fixed timeslot, and the length of the timeslot is not fixed, but depends on the size of the packet. Statistical multiplexing has certain challenges and complexity in meeting deterministic QoS, and its delay performance is dependent on the the used queueing mechanism. This document further describes a generic time division multiplexing scheme in IP/MPLS networks, which we call packet timeslot scheme. It aims to make it easier for the control plane to calculate the delay performance and more flexible to allocate deterministic resources, and also make it easier for the data plane to create more flexible timeslot mapping.</t>
