      <t>This document describes an application programming interface (SGCI) anda corresponding protocol (SGCP) for controlling Voice over IP (VoIP)Gateways from external call control elements. The SGCP assumes a callcontrol architecture where the call control 'intelligence' is outsidethe gateways and handled by external call control elements. The document is structured in 5 main sections: * The introduction presents the basic assumptions and the relation to other protocols such as H.323, RTSP, SAP or SIP.* The interface section presents a conceptual overview of the SGCP, presenting the naming conventions, the usage of the session description protocol SDP, and the five procedurs that compose SGCP: Notifications Request, Notification, Create Connection, Modify Con- nection and Delete Connection. * The protocol description section presents the SGCP encodings, which are based on simple text formats, and the transmission procedure over UDP. * The security section presents the security requirement of SGCP, and its usage of IP security services (IPSEC). * An example section presents two detailed examples of call set up procedures using SGCP. * The description of the changes between version 1.0 and version 1.1</t>
