      <t>This document describes a concise binary encoding of components of the Asynchronous Management Model (AMM) and a binary protocol for the exchange of these items over a nertwork. The intent of this protocol is to provide an efficient exchange of management encoding that conserves computing resources for embedded devices and energy necessary for transmission of protocol data units. AMP is designed to reduce the number of transmitted bytes, operates without sessions or (concurrent) two-way links, and functions autnomously when there is no timely contact with a network operator.</t>
