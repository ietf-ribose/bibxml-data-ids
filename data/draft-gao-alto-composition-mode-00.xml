      <t>This document introduces an extension to the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol, which enables announcements of the composition modes of multiple cost map services. Specifically, the composition mode defines how the results of multiple cost map services are combined to get the final prediction between two network endpoints. This extension allows ALTO servers to improve the accuracy of the prediction model at similar map sizes, and to efficiently enable differentiated services.</t>
