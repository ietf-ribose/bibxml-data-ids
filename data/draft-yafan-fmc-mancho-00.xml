      <t>This document describes the use of SIP between the dual mode handset(DMH) and the mobility SIP proxy to enable network controlledhandovers across voice over IP (VoIP) and cellular networks. Themobility SIP proxy has a peering relationship with the cellularnetwork. Mobile assisted and network controlled handovers requirethe exchange of cellular radio parameters between the DMH and themobility SIP proxy. The set of cellular related parameters iscollectively called Session Handover Protocol (SHP). The SHP is aresidual protocol of SIP, where all of its messages are transportedas MIME attachment to SIP messages.This document describes the requirements, various SIP message flowsfor cross-domain roaming and bidirectional handovers between VoIP andcellular domains, and detailed specification of the residual SHPprotocol.</t>
