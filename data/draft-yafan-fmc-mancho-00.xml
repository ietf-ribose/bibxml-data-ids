      <t>This document describes the use of SIP between the dual mode handset (DMH) and the mobility SIP proxy to enable network controlled handovers across voice over IP (VoIP) and cellular networks. The mobility SIP proxy has a peering relationship with the cellular network. Mobile assisted and network controlled handovers require the exchange of cellular radio parameters between the DMH and the mobility SIP proxy. The set of cellular related parameters is collectively called Session Handover Protocol (SHP). The SHP is a residual protocol of SIP, where all of its messages are transported as MIME attachment to SIP messages. This document describes the requirements, various SIP message flows for cross-domain roaming and bidirectional handovers between VoIP and cellular domains, and detailed specification of the residual SHP protocol.</t>
