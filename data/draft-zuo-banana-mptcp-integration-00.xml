    <abstract>
      <t>BANdwidth Aggregation for interNet Access (BANANA) based on tunnel bonding protocols and Multipath TCP (MPTCP) are two different technology suites that offer subscribers with higher bandwidth and reliability. MPTCP excels at conducting TCP traffic since its flow/congestion control scheme has been well developed while tunnel bonding protocols support not only TCP traffic but also UDP traffic. The integration of the two kinds of technologies can be considered to make use of advantages of both. Moreover, extensions made to the tunnel bonding protocols can simplify the MPTCP stack and keep it intact. This document specifies the extensions for tunnel bonding protocols to realize integrative deployment of tunnel bonding solutions and MPTCP.</t>
