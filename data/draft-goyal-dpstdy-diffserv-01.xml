    <abstract>
      <t>This informational draft presents a simulation study to compare the performance of two and three drop precedence levels in an Assured Forwarding traffic class for mixed TCP/UDP traffic. This is a revised and comprehensive version of our previous study presented at the March 99 IETF Meeting at Minneapolis. For this study, we consulted the principal authors of the Assured Forwarding Class to determine the parameter set and configurations under which it would be beneficial to have 3-drop preferences. The results presented here are based on 1296 simulations (different parameter/traffic pattern combinations). The results of the simulation study suggest that optimal number of drop precedence levels in a traffic class depends on the traffic load and amount of reserved traffic. In a mixed TCP- UDP traffic scenario, best performance can be achieved with either 2 or 3 levels of drop precedence if most of the TCP packets have 'better' drop precedence than excess UDP packets.</t>
