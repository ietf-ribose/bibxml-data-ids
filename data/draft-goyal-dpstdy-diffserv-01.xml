      <t>This informational draft presents a simulation study to compare theperformance of two and three drop precedence levels in an AssuredForwarding traffic class for mixed TCP/UDP traffic. This is a revisedand comprehensive version of our previous study presented at theMarch 99 IETF Meeting at Minneapolis. For this study, we consultedthe principal authors of the Assured Forwarding Class to determinethe parameter set and configurations under which it would bebeneficial to have 3-drop preferences. The results presented here arebased on 1296 simulations (different parameter/traffic patterncombinations). The results of the simulation study suggest thatoptimal number of drop precedence levels in a traffic class dependson the traffic load and amount of reserved traffic. In a mixed TCP-UDP traffic scenario, best performance can be achieved with either 2or 3 levels of drop precedence if most of the TCP packets have'better' drop precedence than excess UDP packets.</t>
