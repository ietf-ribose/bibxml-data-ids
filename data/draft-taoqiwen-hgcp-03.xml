      <t>In an era where AI-generated content has become indistinguishable from human writing, the Human-Generated Content Protocol (HGCP) proposes a voluntary signing framework that enables human authors to publicly acknowledge their expressions. Rather than detecting or classifying content origin, HGCP allows individuals to declare, in a structured and verifiable format, that they take responsibility for a specific piece of content. The protocol is platform-neutral, identity-flexible, and suitable for both real-name and pseudonymous use. It does not evaluate accuracy, originality, or quality; it simply enables people to say: “This is mine, and I stand by it.” By providing a lightweight, human-first declaration format, HGCP aims to preserve the visibility of human agency within an increasingly synthetic information ecosystem.</t>
