      <t>This document defines lightweight secure neighbor discovery for low-power and lossy networks. The nodes generate a CryptographicallyGenerated Address using an Elliptic Curve Cryptography public key,register the Cryptographically Generated Address with a defaultrouter and periodically refresh the registration. Modifications to6lowpan Neighbor Discovery protocol are described for secure neighbordiscovery for low-power and lossy networks. Cryptographicallygenerated address and digital signature are calculated using ellipticcurve cryptography public key of the node.</t>
