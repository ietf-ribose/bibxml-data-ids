      <t>The IAB has been working toward establishing a liaison relationship between the Internet Society and ISO/JTC 1. A liaison with ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 6 has been offered, and there have been indications that liaisons with any of the other SCs will be granted without problems as needed. Further progress is subject to the preparation and approval of a 'cooperative agreement' between the two organizations. The present document is a draft of that cooperative agreement. It stresses the main points of agreement: mutual recognition of standards, information on work programs, information sharing and possible collaborative efforts. In line with JTC 1 decisions, this draft cooperative agreement covers liaison with SC 6. The Internet Society looks forward to establishing similar liaisons with other appropriate JTC 1 subcommittees in the near future. This version is a draft. It will have to be reviewed by the members of the Internet community and discussed with ISO/IEC JTC 1. The term 'organization' in the following refers either to the Internet Society or to SC 6.</t>
