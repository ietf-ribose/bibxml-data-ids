      <t>Generally, next SDP is alternative descriptions for the previous oneof the same session. But there is other type of SDP which describepart of the session, not all aspects of the session. It must becombined with the previous one(or ones) to show the effects. Therehas been such usage of SDPs in RFC3108. But there is no suchguidance for that extension and usage. This text is aimed for that.</t>
