      <t>The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol defined in [RFC9420] is an asynchronous secure group messaging protocol, which allows group members to propose their removal from a group. However, in some cases MLS clients can't reliably use regular Remove or SelfRemove proposals to leave a group because they don't have an up-to-date group state. This document specifies a LeafOperationIntent, which does not need an up-to-date group state but which retains sufficient binding to the client's current state to avoid replay attacks.</t>
