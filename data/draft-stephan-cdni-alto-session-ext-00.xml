      <t>The selection of a downstream CDN by an upstream CDN is based on multi-dimensional criteria such as the number of hops, the performance of the connections between the user-agent and downstream CDNs and the availability of downstream CDNs resources. Various protocols, such as BGP or ALTO, may be used by an upstream CDN to collect footprints and interconnection preferences of downstream CDNs. This draft introduces several extensions to the ALTO protocol for CDN interconnection.</t>
