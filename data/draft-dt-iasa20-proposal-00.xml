    <abstract>
      <t>The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally established in 2005. In the intervening years, the needs of the IETF have evolved in ways that require changes to its administrative structure. The IETF Chair started an effort in November of 2016 to begin the process of changing the IETF administrative structure, starting with a set of virtual workshops to get input from the IETF community, and then encompassing a series of BOF sessions at IETF meetings to define the problem, develop requirements, explore potential options for changes, and a Design Team - the authors of this document - that would make recommendations. The purpose of this document is to collect all of the various materials that have lead up to the Design Team recommendation that IETF be a Disregarded Limited Liability Company (LLC) of the Internet Society.</t>
