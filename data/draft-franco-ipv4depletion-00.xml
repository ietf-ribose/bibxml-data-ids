      <t>This document addresses the problem of IP v4 address space depletion.This document proposes an easy, technical solution based on the useof two options in the IP packet. The IP Version is used to extendthe current IP v4 address universe to 25 to 30 billion IP addresses.A modified IP packet header Option 3, the Loose Source and RecordRouter (LSRR), is used to carry source ip version, source ip prefix,destination ip version, and destination ip prefix in the IP networkpacket. This document introduces the concepts of RIR nebulae (or IPaddress nebula) and mirror prefixes (or pseudo prefixes). RIR nebulaeare concurrent IP v4 address spaces which are differentiated from oneanother by the IP Version in the IP network packet header. The mirrorprefixes (/33 to /255) emulate or mirror standard prefixes (/0 to /31).The single host route (/32 or 255.255.255.255) is supported in all RIRnebulae. The new extended IP v4 universe (a new, hypothetical Internet)is comprised of multiple IP v4 address spaces and DNS domains of 4.2billion addresses.</t>
