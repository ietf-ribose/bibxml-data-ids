      <t>This document specifies transfer protocols for instant messages and presence information. The Presence Information Transfer Protocol (PITP) allows clients to set presence information for presentities they control and to request presence information from other presentities. The Instant Message Transfer Protocol (IMTP) allows clients to send and receive instant messages. Both protocols can also be used to relay instant message and presence requests between servers as necessary. These protocols are specified in the same document because they have very similar structure. However, they are two logically separate protocols. Sections specific to one or the other protocol will be recognizeable by a leading 'PITP' or 'IMTP'.</t>
