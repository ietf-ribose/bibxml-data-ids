      <t>The Domain Name System's wire protocol includes a number of fixed fields whose range has been or soon will be exhausted and does not allow requestors to advertise their capabilities to responders. This document describes backward compatible mechanisms for allowing the protocol to grow. This document updates the EDNS(0) specification (and obsoletes RFC 2671) based on feedback from deployment experience in several implementations. It also closes the IANA registry for extended labels created as part of RFC 2671 and obsoletes RFC 2673 ("Binary Labels in the Domain Name System") which depends on the existence of extended labels.</t>
