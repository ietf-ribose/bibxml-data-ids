      <t>The purpose of traditional mobility support is to provide continuousInternet connectivity to mobile hosts only (host mobility support).In contrast, network mobility support (NEMO support) deals withsituations where an entire network changes its point of attachment tothe Internet and thus its reachability in the topology. In thissituation, mobility support is to provide continuous Internetsessions not only to the router connecting the mobile network to theglobal Internet, but also to nodes behind the mobile router. Thisdocument tries to identify what constraints limit the implementationand the deployment of a potentially and ideally good solution, andwhat requirements solutions must comply with. Our main aim is toraise the discussion on the mailing list.</t>
