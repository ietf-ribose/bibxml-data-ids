      <t>The purpose of traditional mobility support is to provide continuous Internet connectivity to mobile hosts only (host mobility support). In contrast, network mobility support (NEMO support) deals with situations where an entire network changes its point of attachment to the Internet and thus its reachability in the topology. In this situation, mobility support is to provide continuous Internet sessions not only to the router connecting the mobile network to the global Internet, but also to nodes behind the mobile router. This document tries to identify what constraints limit the implementation and the deployment of a potentially and ideally good solution, and what requirements solutions must comply with. Our main aim is to raise the discussion on the mailing list.</t>
