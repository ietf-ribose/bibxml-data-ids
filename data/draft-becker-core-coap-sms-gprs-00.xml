      <t>The Short Message Service (SMS) of mobile cellular networks is frequently used in Machine-To-Machine (M2M) communications, such as for telematic devices. The service offers small packet sizes and high delays just as other typical low-power and lossy networks (LLNs), i.e. 6LoWPANs. The design of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), that took the limitations of LLNs into account, is thus also applicable to telematic M2M devices. The adaption of CoAP to the SMS transport mechanism is described in this document.</t>
