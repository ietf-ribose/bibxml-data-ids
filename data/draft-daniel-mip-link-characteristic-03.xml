      <t>This document introduces a model for link characteristic information delivery from the mobile node to the home agent and correspondent node(s). This model allows the home agent and correspondent node(s) to know the characteristics of the link the mobile node is currently attached to. Based on this information, the home agent and correspondent node(s) may shape ongoing traffic according to the current available link capacity (e.g. bandwidth) to the mobile node. This model can be applicable for Mobile IPv4 as well as Mobile IPv6.</t>
