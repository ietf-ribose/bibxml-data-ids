      <t>This document defines extensions of PRoPHET, a Probabilistic Routing Protocol using History of Encounters and Transitivity. The document presents two extensions of current PRoPHET draft-09. The first extension is to apply the contact duration to calculate the delivery predictability. The other is to provide a forward strategy which can alleviate the bundle starving problem by considering expiration of bundles.</t>
