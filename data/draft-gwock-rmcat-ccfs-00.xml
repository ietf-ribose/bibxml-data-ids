      <t>This document describes CCFS(Congestion Control based on Forward path Status), rate adaptation scheme for interactive real-time media applications, such as video conferencing. CCFS manages forward path's status based on the estimated three major parameters - serving bitrate, queue delay and queue delay by cross traffics. Considering only forward path status minimizes the effects of backward path's network event such as congestion. It also is free from compatibility issues because it defines generalized feedback message and minimizes receiver's role.</t>
