      <t>This document provides a terminology for benchmarking SIP performance in networking devices. Terms are included for test components, test setup parameters, and performance benchmark metrics for black-box benchmarking of SIP networking devices. The performance benchmark metrics are obtained for the SIP control plane and media plane. The terms are intended for use in a companion methodology document for complete performance characterization of a device in a variety of conditions making it possible to compare performance of different devices. It is critical to provide test setup parameters and a methodology document for SIP performance benchmarking because SIP allows a wide range of configuration and operational conditions that can influence performance benchmark measurements. It is necessary to have terminology and methodology standards to ensure that reported benchmarks have consistent definition and were obtained following the same procedures. Benchmarks can be applied to compare performance of a variety of SIP networking devices.</t>
