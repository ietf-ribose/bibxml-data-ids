      <t>This Internet-Draft describes DNS name server and stub resolver behavior that results in a significant query volume sent to the root and top-level domain (TLD) name servers. In some cases we recommend minor additions to the DNS protocol specification and corresponding changes in name server implementations to alleviate these unnecessary queries. In one case, we have highlighted behavior of a popular name server implementation that does not conform to the DNS specification. The recommendations made in this document are a direct byproduct of observation and analysis of abnormal query traffic patterns seen at two of the thirteen root name servers and all thirteen com/net/org TLD name servers.</t>
