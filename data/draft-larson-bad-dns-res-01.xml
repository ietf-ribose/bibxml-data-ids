      <t>This Internet-Draft describes DNS name server and stub resolverbehavior that results in a significant query volume sent to theroot and top-level domain (TLD) name servers. In some cases werecommend minor additions to the DNS protocol specification andcorresponding changes in name server implementations to alleviatethese unnecessary queries. In one case, we have highlightedbehavior of a popular name server implementation that does notconform to the DNS specification. The recommendations made in thisdocument are a direct byproduct of observation and analysis ofabnormal query traffic patterns seen at two of the thirteen rootname servers and all thirteen com/net/org TLD name servers.</t>
