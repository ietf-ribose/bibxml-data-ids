      <t>With the definition of standardized media types in MIME it has becomenecessary to keep mapping tables which translate between the standardmedia type names, commonly used file name extensions, any platformspecific typing mechanism, and helper applications to view, compose,edit or print media types. Supplying a set of site defaults isuseful so that users won't have to configure well-known types. Themailcap mechanism provides some of this functionality in ahomogeneous environment with a shared file system, and both theMacintosh program 'Internet Config' and the Windows Registry have hadsome success in consolidating these tables for multiple applicationson a single machine. But neither of these addresses the problems ofmulti-platform users or a heterogeneous environment.Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) provides appropriatefacilities for this need. ACAP's dataset structure is extensible andACAP's inheritance feature provides for enterprise default settingswith per-user customization. This memo defines an ACAP dataset classfor media type mapping tables.</t>
