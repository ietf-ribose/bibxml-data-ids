      <t>With the definition of standardized media types in MIME it has become necessary to keep mapping tables which translate between the standard media type names, commonly used file name extensions, any platform specific typing mechanism, and helper applications to view, compose, edit or print media types. Supplying a set of site defaults is useful so that users won't have to configure well-known types. The mailcap mechanism provides some of this functionality in a homogeneous environment with a shared file system, and both the Macintosh program 'Internet Config' and the Windows Registry have had some success in consolidating these tables for multiple applications on a single machine. But neither of these addresses the problems of multi-platform users or a heterogeneous environment. Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) provides appropriate facilities for this need. ACAP's dataset structure is extensible and ACAP's inheritance feature provides for enterprise default settings with per-user customization. This memo defines an ACAP dataset class for media type mapping tables.</t>
