    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the Pisces, an ensemble video transport framework for real-time communication. Pisces complements the benefits of rule-based and learning-based approaches, without modifying the codec layer. Pisces uses an incremental and iterative reinforcement learning model to adapt to the unseen environment. When the real environment well matches the training environment, the learning-based approach is actively working. Otherwise, the rule- based approach is used to ensure transport safety. Proactively probing network capacity simultaneously using both rule-based approach and learning models makes Pisces highly efficient and robust. Pisces can be deployed in WebRTC, which replaces the default Google congestion control algorithm.</t>
