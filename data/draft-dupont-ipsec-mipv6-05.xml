    <abstract>
      <t>IPsec specifications [1-6] do not work well with any mobilitydevice based on addresses [7]. Mobile IPv6 interaction with IPsecis still far from being well achieved. This is mainly due to badinterpretations of IPsec specifications. HIP (Host IdentityPayload) [9] should change this regrettable situation.This document specifies some points where improvements can bemade in many current implementations, on the way of making IPsecmore suitable for Mobile IPv6.</t>
