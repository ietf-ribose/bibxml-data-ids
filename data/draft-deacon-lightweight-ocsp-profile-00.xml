      <t>This document defines a lightweight profile of OCSP (RFC 2560) for use in very large PKI environments such as SSL/TLS, code signing and secure messaging. In these environments there exists a large client base (in the 100's of millions) and thus the ability to scale OCSP request handling is very important.</t>
