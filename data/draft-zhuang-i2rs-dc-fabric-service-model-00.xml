      <t>This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to deliver fabric service for data center networks. This model is intended to be instantiated by management system to deploy the overall fabric service for a data center network. It provides an abstraction of fabric services, including configurations and functions, however is not a configuration model be used directly onto network infrastructures. It should be used combined with such as fabric topology data model defined in [I-D.zhuang-i2rs-yang-dc-fabric-network-topology] with specific topology information to configure the network elements and deliver the service to data center infrastructures.</t>
