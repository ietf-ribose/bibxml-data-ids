    <abstract>
      <t>The aim of this Internet Draft is to define a standard compliant security framework for Low-power and Lossy Networks, in order to enable message encryption and authentication at the MAC layer. The framework is fully compatible with both IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.15.4e standards and supports a wide range of security features to network architectures developed within the 6TiSCH Working Group. In particular, it defines different kinds of security configurations and, for each of them, proposes lightweight mechanisms for the setting-up of a secure IEEE 802.15.4 domain and the negotiation of link keys among devices.</t>
