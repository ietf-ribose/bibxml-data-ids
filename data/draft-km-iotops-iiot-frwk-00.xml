      <t>Industry control networks host a diverse set of non-internet protocols supporting Industrial-IoT and legacy device connections. These networks are physically separated from the enterprise networks and have been slow to adopt the virtualization technologies. Virtualization is necessary to remove the boundaries between the enterprise and process control networks. This document specifies a framework for the converged industrial network. Specifically, it focuses on the virtual PLC scenario. It covers transition technologies required for the convergence of industrial devices with the enterprise application endpoints.</t>
