    <abstract>
      <t>On a multi-access network, one of the PIM routers is elected as a Designated Router (DR). On the last hop LAN, the PIM DR is responsible for tracking local multicast listeners and forwarding traffic to these listeners if the group is operating in PIM-SM. In this document, we propose mechanisms to minimize traffic losses during DR re-election. This document introduces the concept of a Backup Designated Router on a shared LAN and a procedure to perform Delayed DR election. A backup DR on LAN would be useful for faster convergence, whereas a Delayed DR election would be useful for minimizing traffic losses when new routers join a LAN.</t>
