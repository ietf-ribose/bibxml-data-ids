      <t>This document provides a generalized Virtual Router (VR)architecture and specifies the required extensions for [OSPFv2]to adapt the protocol to this architecture, such that separate'instances' of OSPF can be used for different Service Provider (SP)customers connected to different PE to CE links of a single PE box.This architecture accommodates the deployment of layer 3 IP VPNs to facilitate services such as Intranet connectivity, and allows the consolidation of multiple Service Provider (SP) customers onto a single Provider Edge (PE) device, while enforcing all necessary security between different customer data.</t>
