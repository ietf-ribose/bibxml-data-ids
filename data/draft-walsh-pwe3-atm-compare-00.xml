      <t>Different encapsulation formats have been proposed to carry ATM services over IP, L2TP and MPLS [2], [3], [4]. The cell mode proposals are discussed in [2] and [3]. The frame mode proposals are discussed in [2] and [4]. This paper analyzes certain key issues in these proposals and makes some conclusions.</t>
