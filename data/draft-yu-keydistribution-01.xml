    <abstract>
      <t>There are several key distribution systems based on the physical layer of the LTE Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication system, utilizing the random and high-agreement secret key generation schemes from noisy wideband channels. These systems are used in conjunction with physical layer authentication systems that are also based on physical characteristics. To characterize these systems, this document proposes a reference model and several test methods of main technical parameters of such systems, including average key generation rate as well as the consistency and the randomness of generated key bits.</t>
