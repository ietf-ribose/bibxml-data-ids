      <t>Mobile operators consider the distribution of mobility anchors to enable offloading some traffic from their core network. In scope of a solution for Distributed Mobility Management is the maintenance of IP sessions and IP address continuity when mobile nodes get a new mobility anchor assigned during handover. This document proposes the use of identifier-locator split concepts to achieve optimal routing of data packets to a mobile node's current mobility anchor. The use of per-host locator IP addresses allows translation of addresses within the mobile operator network to route packets to the mobile node's current mobility anchor, while address translation is kept transparent to the communication endpoints.</t>
