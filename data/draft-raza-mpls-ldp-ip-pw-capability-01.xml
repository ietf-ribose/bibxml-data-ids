    <abstract>
      <t>Currently, no LDP capability is exchanged for LDP applications like IP label switching and L2VPN/PW signaling. When an LDP session comes up, an LDP speaker may unnecessarily advertise its local state for such LDP applications even when the peer session may be established for some other applications like ICCP. This document proposes a solution by which an LDP speaker announces its "incapability" or disability or non-support for IP label switching or L2VPN/PW application, hence disabling corresponding application state exchange over the established LDP session.</t>
