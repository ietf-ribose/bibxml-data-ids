      <t>As part of the Transport Profile for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP) there is a requirement to support 1:n linear protection for transport paths. This requirement is elaborated on in the MPLS-TP Survivability Framework document [SurvivFwk]. The basic protocol for linear protection was specified in the MPLS-TP Linear Protection document [LinProt] but is limited to 1+1 and 1:1 protection. This document extends the protocol defined there to address the additional functionality necessary to support scenarios of a single protection path preconfigured to provide protection of multiple transport paths between two joint endpoints. This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</t>
