      <t>This document discusses formally verifiable networking framework for software-defined networks (SDN). In SDN, incomplete or malicious programmable entities could cause break-down of underlying networks shared by heterogeneous devices and stake-holders. Formally verifiable networking can provide a logic-based framework to unify the design, specification, verification, and implementation of SDN. This framework describes formal specification and verification process for SDN. In addition, we present two examples of formal specification for a part of SDN using a process algebra called Algebra of Communicating Shard Resources (ACSR) and Z specification languages.</t>
