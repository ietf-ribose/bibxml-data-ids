      <t>The purpose of this document is to describe, in some detail, the meaning and use of the result codes used with the LDAPv3 protocol. Of particular importance are the error codes, which represent the majority of the result codes. This document provides definitions for each result code, and outlines the expected behaviour of the various operations with respect to how result codes and in particular, error conditions should be handled and which specific error code should be returned. The LDAPv3 RFC [RFC2251] states that 'An LDAP server MUST act in accordance with the X.500(1993) series of ITU recommendations when providing the service. However, it is not required that an LDAP server make use of any X.500 protocols in providing this service, e.g. LDAP can be mapped onto any other directory system so long as the X.500 data and service model as used in LDAP is not violated in the LDAP interface.' The goal of this document is to transfer the applicable information from X.511 to this document, and expand upon it for LDAP.</t>
