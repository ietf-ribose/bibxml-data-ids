      <t>QUIC does not provide a complete version negotiation mechanism but instead only provides a way for the server to indicate that the version the client offered is unacceptable. This document describes a version negotiation mechanism that allows a client and server to select a mutually supported version. Optionally, if the original and negotiated version share a compatible Initial format, the negotiation can take place without incurring an extra round trip. Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the QUIC IETF mailing list quic@ietf.org (mailto:quic@ietf.org) or on the GitHub repository which contains the draft: https://github.com/quicwg/ version-negotiation/ (https://github.com/quicwg/version- negotiation/).</t>
