      <t>This memo discusses the need for standards that support SPam overInternet Telephony (SPIT) prevention applications. After explainingthe general need for SPIT prevention applications the memo provides areference scenario for potential communication between entities thatmay be involved in SPIT prevention. Within this scenario the needfor standardizing communication is analyzed for each pair ofcommunicating entities. The analysis is intended to serve as astarting point for discussing the requirements for signalingstandards as well as for architectural considerations, that supportSPIT prevention applications.This memo is not intended to suggest any solution of SPIT signalingissues. Such work, if necessary at all, should be object of separatedocuments.</t>
