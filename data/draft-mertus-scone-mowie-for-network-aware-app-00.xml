    <abstract>
      <t>With the deployment of 5G networks, cloud-based interactive services such as cloud gaming have gained substantial attention. To ensure users' quality of experience (QoE), a cloud interactive service may require not only high bandwidth (e.g., high-resolution media transmission) but also low delay (e.g., low latency and low lagging). However, the quality perceived by a user of a mobile and wireless device may vary widely as a function of many factors, and unhandled changes can substantially compromise the user's QoE. In this document, we investigate network-aware applications (NAA), which realize cloud-based interactive services with improved QoE, by efficient utilization of a solution named Mobile and Wireless Information Exposure (MoWIE). In particular, this document demonstrates, through realistic evaluations, that mobile network information such as MCS (Modulation and Coding Scheme) can effectively expose the dynamics of the underlying network and can be made available to applications through MoWIE; using such an information, the applications can then adapt key control knobs such as media codec schemes, encapsulation, and application layer processing to minimize QoE distortion. Following evaluations we give a cursory overview of the design space for implementing MoWIE</t>
