      <t>This document specifies the Trajectory-based Recognition of Identity Proof (TRIP) protocol, a decentralized mechanism for establishing claims of physical-world presence through cryptographically signed, spatially quantized location attestations called "breadcrumbs." Breadcrumbs are chained into an append-only log, bundled into verifiable epochs, and distilled into a Trajectory Identity Token (TIT) that serves as a persistent pseudonymous identifier. The protocol employs a Criticality Engine grounded in statistical physics to distinguish biological movement from synthetic trajectories. Power Spectral Density analysis detects the 1/f signature of Self-Organized Criticality in human mobility. A six- component Hamiltonian energy function scores each breadcrumb against the identity's learned behavioral profile in real time. This revision formalizes the mapping to the RATS Architecture (RFC 9334), clarifies the Verifier trust model including support for multiple independent Verifiers, introduces an active challenge- response verification protocol that binds Attestation Results to specific Relying Party requests with cryptographic freshness, and corrects the privacy model to accurately describe the flow of Evidence between Attester and Verifier. TRIP is designed to be transport-agnostic and operates independently of any particular naming system, blockchain, or application layer.</t>
