      <t>This document presents a framework for interoperation between theContext Transfer Protocol (CTP) and the Next Steps in Signaling(NSIS) protocols. The main goals we are trying to achieve are: toprovide a seamless handover, to establish QoS and other statesrequired by NSIS, to have this process appropriately secured, and totradeoff between security, complexity and performance.</t>
