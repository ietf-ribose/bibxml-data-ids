      <t>This document presents a framework for interoperation between the Context Transfer Protocol (CTP) and the Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) protocols. The main goals we are trying to achieve are: to provide a seamless handover, to establish QoS and other states required by NSIS, to have this process appropriately secured, and to tradeoff between security, complexity and performance.</t>
