      <t>The original IP architecture assumes that each Data Link subnetwork is labeled with a single IP network number. As indicated in RFC1620, this assumption may be violated for large data networks, including ATM-based networks. The architecture works even when this assumption is violated, but it imposes constraints on communication among hosts and routers through an ATM-based network, which in turn may preclude full utilization of ATM capabilities. This document describes extensions to the IP architecture that relaxes these constraints, thus enabling the full utilization of the services provided by ATM.</t>
