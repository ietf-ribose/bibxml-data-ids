      <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software- Defined Networking (SDN) systems. A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and without necessarily completely replacing it. This document specifies the procedures and PCEP extensions when a PCE-based controller is also responsible for configuring the forwarding actions on the routers, in addition to computing the paths for packet flows in the for Segment Routing (SR) in IPv6 (SRv6) network and telling the edge routers what instructions to attach to packets as they enter the network. PCECC is further enhanced for SRv6 SID (Segment Identifier) allocation and distribution.</t>
