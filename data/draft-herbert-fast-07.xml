      <t>This document describes the Firewalls and Service Tickets (FAST) protocol. This is a generic and extensible protocol for hosts to signal network nodes to request services or to gain admission into a network. A ticket is data that accompanies a packet and indicates a granted right to traverse a network or a request for network services to be applied (in the latter case the ticket serves as a service profile). Applications request tickets from a local agent in their network and attach issued tickets to packets. Firewall tickets are issued to grant packets the right to traverse a network; service tickets indicate the desired service to be applied to packets. A single ticket may provide both firewall and service ticket information and semantics. Tickets are sent in IPv6 Hop-by-Hop options.</t>
