      <t>This document specifies Echo protocol, that was firstly defined inRFC 862. However that document does not match current InternetStandards and specifies Echo protocol for TCP and UDP only, while anumber of other transport-layer protocols have appeared since thetime of publication of RFC 862. This document aligns Echo protocol specification with the currentInternet Standards and specifies Echo protocol for the most wide-spread transport-layer protocols. It obsoletes RFC 347 and RFC 862and moves the last to Historic status.</t>
