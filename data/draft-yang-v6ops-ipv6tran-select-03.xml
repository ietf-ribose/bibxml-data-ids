      <t>Many IPv6 transition technologies has been proposed, such as Dual-Stack, 6rd and so on. An CPE may support some of them instead of only one. But the ISPs always support different kinds of transition technologies. So they must control all the CPEs to match the exact transition tech through the CPEs' management system or configuring them before issuing to the customers.</t>
