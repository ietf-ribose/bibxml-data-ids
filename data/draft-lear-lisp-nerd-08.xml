      <t>LISP is a protocol to encapsulate IP packets in order to allow endsites to multihome without injecting routes from one end of theInternet to another. This memo presents an experimental database anda discussion of methods to transport the mapping of EIDs to RLOCs torouters in a reliable, scalable, and secure manner.
