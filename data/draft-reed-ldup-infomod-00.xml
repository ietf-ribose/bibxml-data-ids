      <t>[LDUP Model] describes the architectural approach to replication of LDAP directory contents. This document describes the information model and schema elements which support LDAP Replication Services which conform to [LDUP Model]. Directory schema is extended to provide object classes, subentries, and attributes to describe areas of the namespace which are under common administrative authority, units of replication (ie, subtrees, or partitions of the namespace, which are replicated), servers which hold replicas of various types for the various partitions of the namespace, which namespaces are held on given servers, and the progress of various namespace management and replication operations. Among other things, this knowledge of where directory content is located will provide the basis for dynamic generation of LDAP referrals for clients who can follow them. The controlling framework by which the relationships, types, and health of replicas of the directory content will be defined so that, as much as possible, directory content is itself used to monitor and control the environment. Security information, including access control policy identifiers and information will be treated as directory content by the replication protocols when specified by the LDAPEXT group. The information model will describe required and optional house- keeping duties for compliant systems to implement, such as garbage collection of deleted objects, reconciliation of moved and renamed objects, update sequencing and transaction bracketing of changes, etc.</t>
