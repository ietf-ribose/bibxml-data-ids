      <t>[LDUP Model] describes the architectural approach to replication ofLDAP directory contents. This document describes the informationmodel and schema elements which support LDAP Replication Serviceswhich conform to [LDUP Model]. Directory schema is extended to provide object classes, subentries,and attributes to describe areas of the namespace which are undercommon administrative authority, units of replication (ie, subtrees,or partitions of the namespace, which are replicated), servers whichhold replicas of various types for the various partitions of thenamespace, which namespaces are held on given servers, and theprogress of various namespace management and replication operations.Among other things, this knowledge of where directory content islocated will provide the basis for dynamic generation of LDAPreferrals for clients who can follow them. The controlling framework by which the relationships, types, andhealth of replicas of the directory content will be defined so that,as much as possible, directory content is itself used to monitor andcontrol the environment. Security information, including access control policy identifiers andinformation will be treated as directory content by the replicationprotocols when specified by the LDAPEXT group. The information model will describe required and optional house-keeping duties for compliant systems to implement, such as garbagecollection of deleted objects, reconciliation of moved and renamedobjects, update sequencing and transaction bracketing of changes, etc.</t>
