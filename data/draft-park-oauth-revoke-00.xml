    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes the revocation of an access token in the case that a client uses the access token illegally or maliciously. Contrast to the existing revocation defined in RFC7009, the proposed revocation is initiated by a resource server when the abnormal behaviors of a client such as too many DB queries are detected. The revocation process after revocation initiation is based on RFC7009.</t>
