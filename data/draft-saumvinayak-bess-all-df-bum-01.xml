      <t>The Designated forwarder concept is leveraged to prevent looping of BUM traffic into tenant network sourced across NVO fabric for multihoming deployments. [RFC7432] defines a prelimn approach to select the DF for an ES,VLAN or ES,Vlan Group panning across multiple NVE's. [RFC8584] makes the election logic more robust and fine grained inculcating fair election of DF handling most of the prevalent use-cases. This document presents a deployment problem and a corresponding solution which cannot be easily resolve by rules mentioned in [RFC7432] and [RFC8584].</t>
