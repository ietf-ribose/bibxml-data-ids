      <t>This document identifies the basic information to be handled by Service Level Specification (SLS, [RFC 2475], [DS-TERMS]) when considering the deployment of value-added IP service offerings over the Internet. Such IP service offerings can be provided together with a given quality of service (QoS), which is expected to be defined in such SLS, from a technical standpoint. Since these IP services are likely to be provided over the whole Internet, their corresponding QoS will be based upon a set of technical parameters that both customers and services providers will have to agree upon. From this perspective, this draft aims at listing (and promoting a standard formalism for) a set of basic parameters which will actually compose the elementary contents of a SLS.</t>
