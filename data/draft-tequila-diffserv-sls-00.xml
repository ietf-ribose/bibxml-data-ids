      <t>This document identifies the basic information to be handled byService Level Specification (SLS, [RFC 2475], [DS-TERMS]) whenconsidering the deployment of value-added IP service offerings overthe Internet. Such IP service offerings can be provided together witha given quality of service (QoS), which is expected to be defined insuch SLS, from a technical standpoint. Since these IP services arelikely to be provided over the whole Internet, their correspondingQoS will be based upon a set of technical parameters that bothcustomers and services providers will have to agree upon. From thisperspective, this draft aims at listing (and promoting a standardformalism for) a set of basic parameters which will actually composethe elementary contents of a SLS.</t>
