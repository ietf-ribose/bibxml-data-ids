      <t>Cloud computing is rapidly gaining importance, not only because of being ubiquitous, but also, due to ease of management of hugely increasing data, specially, multimedia contents. The next era is going to be of cloud federation, in which services would be brought up to the user through multiple clouds, creating an Inter-Cloud computing environment. On the other hand, increase in multimedia content requires much better service provisioning, responsiveness, and efficient transcoding. Thoroughly designing the architecture of Media Cloud Inter-Cloud Computing is today's requirement. This document focuses on this important issue and presents architectural fundamentals and key concerns in Media Cloud Inter-Cloud Computing.</t>
