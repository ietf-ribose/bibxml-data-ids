    <abstract>
      <t>In many protocols, such as IP Paging [1] and PANA [2], there is the need for the user to discover an agent in the network: In IP Paging, the user first needs to discover the address of the Paging agent in order to perform Paging registration, Paging Area Update and other paging procedures. In the same way, in PANA, the user first needs to discover the PANA Authentication Agent to know where to send its credential. This document describes an efficient method for a user to discover one, or many agents in the network.</t>
