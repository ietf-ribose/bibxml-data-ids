      <t>This document describes the use cases and related requirements of Massive Data Transmission（MDT）in High Bandwidth-delay Product (BDP) Network. The MDT framework enables efficient use of nighttime idle bandwidth to provide services such as same-day or next-day delivery. To meet these objectives, the system introduces a terminal-driven intelligent parameter optimization method that adjusts local configurations (e.g., disk I/O, NIC bandwidth, TCP buffer) to match transmission goals. This document outlines the end-to-end architecture and key mechanisms including service identification and traffic statistics, network layer load balancing, transmission protocol optimization, collaboration between terminal APP, network device and controller, etc.</t>
