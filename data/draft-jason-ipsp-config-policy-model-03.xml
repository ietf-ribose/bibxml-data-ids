      <t>This document presents an object-oriented model of low-level IPsec policy designed to: o facilitate agreement about the content and semantics of IPsec policy o enable derivations of task-specific representations of IPsec policy such as storage schema, distribution representations, and policy specification languages used to configure IPsec- enabled endpoints The schema described in this document models the IKE phase one parameters as described in [1] and the IKE phase two parameters for the IPsec Domain of Interpretation as described in [2, 3, 4, 5].</t>
