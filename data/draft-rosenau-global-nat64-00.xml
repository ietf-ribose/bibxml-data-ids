      <t>This document describes an idea of a IPv6-to-IPv4 translation method. The advantage of the method is that the required public IPv4 addresses are shared between the internet providers (and even between the RIRs) so there are less IPv4 addresses required for IPv6-to-IPv4 translation mechanisms (NAT64, DS-Lite, 464XLAT). The main disadvantage is that an IPv4 address range would have to be reserved for this method.</t>
