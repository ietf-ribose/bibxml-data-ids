      <t>This document proposes HighSpeed TCP, a modification to TCP'scongestion control mechanism for use with TCP connections withlarge congestion windows. The congestion control mechanismsof the current Standard TCP constrains the congestion windowsthat can be achieved by TCP in realistic environments. Forexample, for a Standard TCP connection with 1500-byte packetsand a 100 ms round-trip time, achieving a steady-statethroughput of 10 Gbps would require an average congestionwindow of 83,333 segments, and a packet drop rate of at mostone congestion event every 5,000,000,000 packets (orequivalently, at most one congestion event every 1 2/3 hours).This is widely acknowledged as an unrealistic constraint. Toaddress this limitation of TCP, this document proposesHighSpeed TCP, and solicits experimentation and feedback fromthe wider community.</t>
