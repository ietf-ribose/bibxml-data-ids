      <t>This draft specifies an Ethernet Layer 2 Virtual Private Service Protocol using Ethernet addressing hierarchy and service separation. This protocol enables Service Providers to deploy an Ethernet Network and offer scalable and manageable layer 2 Transparent LAN Services (L2TLS). The primary goal of this protocol is to eliminate the need of the Service Provider to manage customer address information and forwarding within its network. Another goal is to allow auto provisioning of VPN service instances within the Service Provider networks. This solution maintains customer benefits of simplicity of access to the VPN, allows efficient utilization of Service Provider network resources, and overcomes distance limitations of customer's LANs.</t>
