      <t>This document defines an experimental protocol called the Server Load Balancing Registration Protocol (SLBRP). This protocol permits servers to register and coordinate services with a service load balancing (SLB) application. Coordination between real servers and the SLB application will include service definition(s), Virtual IP (VIP) address support, server application health monitoring, as well as, optional support for automatic Domain Name System (DNS) and DNS- based Global Server Load Balancer (GSLB) updates. This document also describes Anycast Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) implementations that can operate with an SLB and GSLB based enterprise infrastructure.</t>
