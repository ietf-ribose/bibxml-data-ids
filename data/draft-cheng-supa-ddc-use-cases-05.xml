      <t>Large scale DCs can provide various services and usually have a lot of internal and external links, and these links are usually VPNs. The Service provisioning and network connectivity configurations are complex and sometimes dynamic, for which manual configuration is not suitable. This draft analyzes the use case in Distributed Data Centers (DDC), in which some VPN scenarios are covered, and the applicability of SUPA data models which can be used for better resource usage and easy service/network configuration.</t>
