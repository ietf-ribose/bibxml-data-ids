      <t>This document describes how the experimental IPv6 Hop-by-Hop and Destinations Option types can concurrently support different experimental options. This is accomplished by employing a format in the Option Data for experimental option types. The format contains an experiment identifier that indicates an experimental option contained in the trailing Option Data. This approach is robust to experiments that are not registered and to those that do not use this sharing mechanism. It is recommended for all new Destination and Hop-by-Hop options that use experimental codepoints.</t>
