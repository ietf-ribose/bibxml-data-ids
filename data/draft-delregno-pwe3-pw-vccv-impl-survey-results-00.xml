      <t>Most Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) encapsulations mandatethe use of the Control Word (CW) in order to better emulate theservices for which the encapsulations have been defined. However,some encapulations treat the Control Word as optional. As a result,implementations of the CW, for encapsulations for which it isoptional, vary by equipment manufacturer, equipment model and serviceprovider network. Similarly, Virtual Circuit ConnectivityVerification (VCCV) supports three Control Channel (CC) types andmultiple Connectivity Verification (CV) Types. This flexibility hasled to reports of interoperability issues within deployed networksand associated drafts to attempt to remedy the situation. Thissurvey of the PW/VCCV user community was conducted to determineimplementation trends. The survey and results is presented herein.</t>
