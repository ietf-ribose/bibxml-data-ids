      <t>This document describes a set of practices for connecting stub networks to adjacent infrastructure networks, as well as to larger network fabrics. This is applicable in cases such as constrained (Internet of Things) networks where there is a need to provide functional parity of service discovery and reachability between devices on the stub network and devices on an adjacent infrastructure link (for example, a home network). The stub networks use case is intended to fully address the need to attach a single network link to an infrastructure network, where the attached link provides no through routing and in cases where integration to the infrastructure routing fabric (if any) is not available.</t>
