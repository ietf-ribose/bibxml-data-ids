      <t>This document describes the Domain-Aware Routing Technology (DART), a novel addressing and routing protocol that introduces a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)-centric addressing model. DART operates over existing IP (IPv4 or IPv6) networks and employs the Domain Name System (DNS) as its control plane to map domain names to IP addresses. Within full compatibility with current IP infrastructure, DART extends the effective address space to infinity, enables seamless communication between IPv4 and IPv6 networks, and significantly improves Internet scalability and evolvability. By localizing the IP address space within each DNS domain, DART provides unlimited address reuse and constructs a more aggregated routing structure that alleviates global routing table pressure. The protocol transforms the paradigm from "IP-based addressing" to "domain-based addressing," laying the foundation for a unified, name- driven networking architecture. DART can be gradually deployed and upgraded without affecting existing communications, requiring hardware upgrades only for a small number of critical devices. A functional prototype of the DART system has been independently developed and deployed on Internet by the author.</t>
