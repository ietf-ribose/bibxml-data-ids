    <abstract>
      <t>This is the definition of an IMAP command for reporting spam. Spam can be flagged using the $Junk and $NotJunk keywords. Spam reporting is meant to correspond to a command to be run on the IMAP server, in order to tune filters and possibly mitigate further attempts. This behavior can be obtained by moving message to a special folder that is being observed by the server. Purpose This is a cleanup of an existing draft and its sole purpose is to discuss whether its core is good for APPSAWG.</t>
