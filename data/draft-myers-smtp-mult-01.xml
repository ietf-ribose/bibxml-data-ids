      <t>SMTP [SMTP] [HOST-REQ] and its service extensions [ESMTP] provide a mechanism for transferring mail reliably and efficiently. The design of the SMTP protocol effectively requires the receiver-SMTP to manage a mail delivery queue. In some limited circumstances, outside the area of mail exchange between independent hosts on public networks, it is desirable to implement a system where a mail receiver does not manage a queue. This document describes an extension command which modifies the SMTP protocol to accommodate this situation. This extension is one which should be used only by specific prior arrangement and configuration. Its use by a sender-SMTP should not be triggered by availability, therefore the extension is not given an ESMTP EHLO keyword.</t>
