      <t>Mobile IP Authentication is a requirement for the TR 45.6CDMA wireless packet data service architecture[8].Diameter AAA, as described in [1] and [2], is used tosupport Mobile IP authentication. This requires that boththe foreign and home network deploy Diameter servers.Currently, RADIUS servers have been deployed and arewidely used in the Internet Service Provider(ISP)arena.While DIAMETER is required to provide the advancedAAA support required by the TR 45.6 architecture, a smoothtransition from RADIUS AAA to Diameter AAA is required. Ata minimum,the Diameter AAA server located in a foreignnetwork must inter-operate with RADIUS AAA located in HomeNetwork.</t>
