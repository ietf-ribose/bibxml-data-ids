      <t>This memorandum describes how RTP carrying MPEG-4 payloads interacts with the MPEG-4 Access Unit layer through the MPEG (Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework) DMIF. DMIF is used to pass information essential for the packing and unpacking of MPEG-4 streams into RTP as well as for adjusting the MPEG-4 AL-PDU lengths to be within the path MTU. DMIF interprets the RTCP reports by comparing its statistics to the requested MPEG-4 media based QoS. If the statistics fail to meet the requested QoS then action is taken to either continue with the impaired perforamce, upgrade the network service class, scale down the stream or delete the stream. This specification is a product of the Audio/Video Transport working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at rem-conf@es.net and/or the authors.</t>
