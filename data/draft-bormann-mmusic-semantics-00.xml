      <t>This memo presents a set of object classes that can be used to define the local representation of the state of the conferences (sessions) that the local system is involved in (LASSO: local session state objects). In addition, some initial information is given on how to map this state to similar semantics in the ITU T.120 series of recommendations. We think these object classes might be used as a basis for defining the dynamic state variables visible in the horizontal control protocol used in a session. This memo is a submission to the IETF MMUSIC working group. Currently, this memo is in ``strawman'' stage. Comments of any kind are positively encouraged and should be addressed to the confctrl@isi.edu mailing list.</t>
