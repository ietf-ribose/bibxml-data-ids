      <t>This document defines extensions to provide Packet LevelAuthentication (PLA) functionality for the HIP protocol. PLAprovides strong hop-by-hop security features that allow intermediatenodes to detect the hostile traffic quickly, and drop the trafficbefore it reaches the destination and can consume resources in thetarget network.Unlikely other similar solutions, PLA does not require excessivesignaling or state in verifying nodes, and is path-independent,making it suitable for dynamic environments, such as ad-hoc networks.</t>
