      <t>This draft describes a profile for compressing Datagram Congestion Control Protocol DCCP/IP using the Efficient Protocol Independent Compression (EPIC) [2] scheme. The RObust Header Compression [1] scheme is designed to compress packet headers over error prone channels. It is built around an extensible core framework that can be tailored to compress new protocol stacks by adding additional ROHC profiles. DCCP [3] is a relatively new protocol and has not yet entered the process of wide implementation. It is intended to provide a unified congestion control interface to the end user applications. It should offer the same unreliable transport as UDP does, and on the other hand, include mechanisms for congestion avoidance and control. This profile describes a new profile for ROHC which will allow DCCP/ IP headers to be compressed.</t>
