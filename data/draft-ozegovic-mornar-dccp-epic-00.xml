      <t>This draft describes a profile for compressing Datagram Congestion Control Protocol DCCP/IP using the Efficient Protocol Independent Compression (EPIC) [2] scheme.The RObust Header Compression [1] scheme is designed to compresspacket headers over error prone channels. It is built around anextensible core framework that can be tailored to compress newprotocol stacks by adding additional ROHC profiles.DCCP [3] is a relatively new protocol and has not yet entered the process of wide implementation. It is intended to provide a unifiedcongestion control interface to the end user applications. It shouldoffer the same unreliable transport as UDP does, and on the other hand, include mechanisms for congestion avoidance and control.This profile describes a new profile for ROHC which will allow DCCP/IP headers to be compressed.</t>
