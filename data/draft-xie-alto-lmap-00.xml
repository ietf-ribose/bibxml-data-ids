      <t>Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important for network diagnostics by providers and users, as well as for public policy. The Large-scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) framework, information model, and protocol have been developed for measurement task dissemination, initialization, reporting and storing. In the context of Large-Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP), measurement results are currently made available in the repository to the public either at the finest granularity level (e.g. as a list of results of all individual tests), or in a very high level human- readable format. This document uses ALTO protocol to provide access to large-scale network measurement results, flexible enough to enable querying of specific and possibly aggregated data.</t>
