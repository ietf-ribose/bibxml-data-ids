    <abstract>
      <t>This draft describes architectural recommendations for a unified concept of Cloud Computing and Internet of Things, based on tried and tested principles from infrastructure science. We describe a functional service architecture that may be applied in the manner of a platform, from the smallest scale to the largest scale, using vendor agnostic principles. The current draft is rooted in the principles of Promise Theory[Bergstra1] and voluntary cooperation.</t>
