    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies Operations and Management (OAM) requirements that improve on the traditional OAM tools like Ping and Traceroute. These requirements have arisen from the fact that more details than given by Ping and Traceroute are required while troubleshooting or doing performance and network planning. These requirements have been gathered from network operators especially from data centers where the networks have slightly different characteristics compared to regular campus/carrier networks.</t>
