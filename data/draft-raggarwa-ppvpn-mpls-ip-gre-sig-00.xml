    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a lightweight mechanism for signaling a PE router's capability to encapsulate MPLS using dynamic GRE and/or IP. This is applicable when a MPLS packet is tunnelled using a dynamic GRE and/or IP encapsulation [MPLS-IP-GRE] between PE routers. For instance the MPLS packet may be a 2547 based MPLS VPN packet [2547bis] or a layer 2 packet transported using MPLS [MARTINI]. Adding such a mechanism has several benefits. It helps in blackhole avoidance and eases transitioning from MPLS tunneling based Layer 3/Layer 2 VPNs to GRE/IP tunneling based Layer 3/Layer 2 VPNs (and vice versa). Such a mechanism is needed where a network may be using MPLS and GRE (or IP) for tunneling, at the same time, in 2547 based or Layer 2 VPNs. It can help in encapsulation selection when multiple tunneling technologies are supported. It can also be used to enhance the security of the network backbone.</t>
