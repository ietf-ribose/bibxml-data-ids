      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based mobility protocol thatenables mobility management for an IP host as it moves acrossdifferent points of attachment within the mobility domain. An IPhost whose mobility is being managed by the network is unaware of theaccess networks capability providing PMIPv6 mobility management onits behalf. This draft proposes mechanisms by which the host isinformed of PMIPv6, as well as means to actively discover suchcapability in the network the host is attaching to. The ability ofthe host to discover or be aware of PMIPv6 support in the accessnetwork enables better decision making in terms of the networkselection, attach procedure, choice of mobility management, as wellas the service/session and even application configuration abilities.</t>
