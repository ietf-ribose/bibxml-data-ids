      <t>This document defines Uniform Resource Identifiers for Physical Objects and human.It provides a proposal for the implementation of the Concept, ”Physical resources as well as humans should be accessible over the Internet and an information object is on the web if it can have a URI ”. It emphasizes on the fact that people should be able to access the physical resources,they possess or even humans,from anywhere in the world through a common standard(URI) e.g. accessing a car from a remote location,or finding the location of the child via URI.As URIs are needed in RDF,XML,so by using them for ubiquitous resources we could easily integrate the world of ubiquitous computing and semantic web i.e. Ubiquitous Semantic Web.</t>
