      <t>Vendors of consumer electronics and network gear have produced andsold hundreds of thousands of Internet hosts with globally routableInternet Protocol addresses embedded within their products' firmware.These products are now in operation world-wide and primarily include,but are not necessarily limited to, low-cost routers and middleboxesfor personal or residential use.This 'hard-coding' of globally routable IP addresses within thehost's firmware presents significant problems to the operation of theInternet and to the management of its address space.This document means to clarify best current practices in the Internetcommunity. It denouces the practice of embedding references tounique, globally routable IP addresses in Internet hosts, describessome of the resulting problems, and considers selected alternatives.It is also intended to remind the Internet community of the ephemeralnature of unique, globally routable IP addresses and that theassignment and use of such addresses is temporary and thereforeshould not be used in fixed configurations.</t>
