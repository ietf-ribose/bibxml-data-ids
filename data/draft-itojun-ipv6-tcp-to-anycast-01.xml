    <abstract>
      <t>IPv6 specification implicitly disallows TCP connection toward IPv6 anycast address. However, if such a connection request happens by mistake, currently there is no way to report the incident to the originator of the TCP connection. The document tries to define a way to disconnect TCP connections made toward IPv6 anycast addresses.</t>
