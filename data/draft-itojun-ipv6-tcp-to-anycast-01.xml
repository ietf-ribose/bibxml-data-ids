      <t>IPv6 specification implicitly disallows TCP connection toward IPv6anycast address. However, if such a connection request happens bymistake, currently there is no way to report the incident to theoriginator of the TCP connection. The document tries to define a way todisconnect TCP connections made toward IPv6 anycast addresses.</t>
