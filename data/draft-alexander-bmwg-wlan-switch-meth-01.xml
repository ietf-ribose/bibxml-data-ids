      <t>This document provides a framework and methodology for performingperformance test and benchmarking of wireless LAN (WLAN) switches andcontrollers, including systems comprising groups of controllers andWTPs. This document defines and discusses a number of tests andassociated test conditions that may be used to characterize theperformance of such systems, and also supplies the methods used tocalculate the expected results of these tests. Specific formats forreporting the results of the tests are also provided, whereapplicable. The tests described in this document extend themethodology defined for benchmarking network interconnect devices inRFC 2544, and LAN switches in RFC 2889, to WLAN switch controllersystems. The methodology herein is to be used together with thecompanion terminology document.</t>
