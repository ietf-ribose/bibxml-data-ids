    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides a framework and methodology for performing performance test and benchmarking of wireless LAN (WLAN) switches and controllers, including systems comprising groups of controllers and WTPs. This document defines and discusses a number of tests and associated test conditions that may be used to characterize the performance of such systems, and also supplies the methods used to calculate the expected results of these tests. Specific formats for reporting the results of the tests are also provided, where applicable. The tests described in this document extend the methodology defined for benchmarking network interconnect devices in RFC 2544, and LAN switches in RFC 2889, to WLAN switch controller systems. The methodology herein is to be used together with the companion terminology document.</t>
