    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines an Real Time Protocol (RTP) payload to send game moves and the state of game objects over RTP. This is useful for games as well collaboration systems that use augment or virtual reality. RTP provide a way to synchronize game state between players with robust technique for recovery from network packet loss while still having low latency.</t>
