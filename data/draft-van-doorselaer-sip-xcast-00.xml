      <t>Explicit Multicast (xcast) is a multicast scheme that uses an explicit list of destinations instead of one logical multicast address. Explicit Multicast complements the existing multicast schemes in that it can efficiently support very large numbers of distinct (small) multicast groups and thus can play an important role in making multicast practical for applications such as multiparty IP telephony, various conferencing &amp; collaborative applications, multiparty networked games, etc... This document explains how multiparty IP telephony conferences making use of xcast can be established by SIP carrying SDP. Some open issues will be identified and discussed. Possible extensions to SIP and SDP to streamline the use of xcast will be suggested as well.</t>
