      <t>Explicit Multicast (xcast) is a multicast scheme that uses anexplicit list of destinations instead of one logical multicastaddress. Explicit Multicast complements the existing multicastschemes in that it can efficiently support very large numbers ofdistinct (small) multicast groups and thus can play an importantrole in making multicast practical for applications such asmultiparty IP telephony, various conferencing &amp; collaborativeapplications, multiparty networked games, etc...This document explains how multiparty IP telephony conferencesmaking use of xcast can be established by SIP carrying SDP. Someopen issues will be identified and discussed. Possible extensions toSIP and SDP to streamline the use of xcast will be suggested aswell.</t>
