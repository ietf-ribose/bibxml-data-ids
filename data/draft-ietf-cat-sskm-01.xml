      <t>This document presents a method for using [SPKM] with exclusivelyshared secret key technologies. The messages and tokens of [SPKM] areunchanged; the only modifications required are to replace the defaultpublic-key cipher suite with ciphers and algorithms suitable for usewith shared secret keys.All messages and tokens defined in [SPKM] are preserved; no changesare required to the various authentication modes of [SPKM]. Integrityalgorithms and key establishment algorithms suitable for use withsecret keys are added to those specified in [SPKM], which are wellknown and specified for use in other existing IETF standards. We ineffect implement the implicit authenticated key exchange protocolproposed in [BR94] using the messages and tokens defined in [SPKM].An overview and brief discussion of the protocol appears in section1. The specific algorithms and object identifiers are listed insection 2. Discussion of how [SPKM] messages are used with sharedsecret keys appears in section 3. Security concerns are addressed insection 4. Patent issues are covered in section 5.</t>
