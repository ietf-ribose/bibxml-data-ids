      <t>This document presents a method for using [SPKM] with exclusively shared secret key technologies. The messages and tokens of [SPKM] are unchanged; the only modifications required are to replace the default public-key cipher suite with ciphers and algorithms suitable for use with shared secret keys. All messages and tokens defined in [SPKM] are preserved; no changes are required to the various authentication modes of [SPKM]. Integrity algorithms and key establishment algorithms suitable for use with secret keys are added to those specified in [SPKM], which are well known and specified for use in other existing IETF standards. We in effect implement the implicit authenticated key exchange protocol proposed in [BR94] using the messages and tokens defined in [SPKM]. An overview and brief discussion of the protocol appears in section 1. The specific algorithms and object identifiers are listed in section 2. Discussion of how [SPKM] messages are used with shared secret keys appears in section 3. Security concerns are addressed in section 4. Patent issues are covered in section 5.</t>
