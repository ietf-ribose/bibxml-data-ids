    <abstract>
      <t>Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) is a general term that refers to a toolset that can be used for fault detection and localization, and for performance measurement. OAM mechanisms have been defined for various layers in the protocol stack, and are used with a variety of protocols. This document presents an overview of the OAM mechanisms that have been defined and are currently being defined by the IETF, as well as a comparison to other OAM mechanisms that have been defined by the IEEE and ITU-T.</t>
