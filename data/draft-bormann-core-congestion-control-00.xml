      <t>The CoAP protocol needs to be implemented in such a way that it does not cause persistent congestion on the network it uses. Congestion control is a complex issue -- the proper rationale for the congestion control mechanisms chosen in CoAP is probably more material than the CoAP protocol specification itself. This informational document attempts to pull out the background material and more extensive considerations behind the CoAP congestion control mechanisms, while leaving the basic MUSTs and MUST NOTs in the main spec.</t>
