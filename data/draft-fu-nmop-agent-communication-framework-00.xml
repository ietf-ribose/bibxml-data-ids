    <abstract>
      <t>As the development of large model and agent technology, it is a trend for multi-agent collaboration to solve complex problems. This document proposes an Agent Communication Framework, a multi-agent communication and collaboration framework that facilitates the coordination of heterogeneous multi-agents and supports intelligent network operations and maintenance (AIOps). Its architecture includes an AI gateway and an Agent Name Service, along with capabilities such as monitoring and tracking, as well as security protection. Agent Communication Framework provides a comprehensive solution for multi-agent communication and collaboration, laying the foundation for future interactive, scalable, secure, and controllable multi-agent network intelligent operations and maintenance.</t>
