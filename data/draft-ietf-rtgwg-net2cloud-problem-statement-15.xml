    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the network-related problems enterprises face today when interconnecting their branch offices with dynamic workloads in third-party data centers (a.k.a. Cloud DCs). There can be many problems associated with connecting to or among Clouds; the Net2Cloud problem statements are mainly for enterprises who already have traditional MPLS services and are interested in leveraging those networks (instead of completely abandoning them). This document aims to describe the problems of continuing using the MPLS networks when connecting workloads in the Cloud, and to clarify additional work in the IETF Routing area. Other problems are out of the scope of this document. Current operational problems are examined to determine whether there is a need to improve existing protocols or whether a new protocol is necessary to solve them.</t>
