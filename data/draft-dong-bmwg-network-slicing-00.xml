      <t>Network slicing aims to provide assurance of specific network performance objectives for network services which require both connectivity and specific performance commitment. Such network services are considered as network slice services. This document provides a benchmarking methodology for network slicing, focusing on evaluating the key functionalities of network slicing mechanisms and the performance of network slice services. The network slicing functionalities includes the data plane, control plane and management plane mechanisms for realizing network slice service, and the performance of network slice service includes the service level agreement (SLA) commitments (bandwidth, delay, and jitter), path constraints and resource guarantee. The tests aim to demonstrate how network slicing can support competing services in a shared network, ensuring that critical network services in one network slice remain unaffected by congestion or unexpected behavior of other traffic in the same network.</t>
