      <t>This document provides a problem statement and general gap analysis for an IP-based autonomic network that is mainly based on distributed network devices. The document provides a background by reviewing the current status of autonomic aspects of IP networks and the extent to which current network management depends on centralisation and human administrators. Finally the document outlines the general features missing from current network abilities that are needed in the ideal autonomic network concept.</t>
