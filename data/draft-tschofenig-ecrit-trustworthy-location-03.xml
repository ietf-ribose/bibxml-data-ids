    <abstract>
      <t>For some location-based applications, such as emergency calling or roadside assistance, it appears that the identity of the requestor is less important than accurate and trustworthy location information. To ensure adequate help location has to be left untouched by the end point or by entities in transit. This document lists different threats, an adversary model, outlines three frequentlly discussed solutions and discusses operational considerations. Finally, the document concludes with a suggestion on how to move forward.</t>
