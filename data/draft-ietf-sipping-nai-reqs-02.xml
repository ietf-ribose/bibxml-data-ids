      <t>There is no requirement for identities asserted by a UA in a SIP message to be anything other than the user's desired alias. A Network Asserted Identity is an identity initially derived by a SIP network intermediary as a result of an authentication process. This draft describes short term requirements for the exchange of Network Asserted Identities within networks of securely interconnected trusted nodes and to User Agents securely connected to such networks.</t>
