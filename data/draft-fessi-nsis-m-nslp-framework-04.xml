      <t>Monitoring, metering and accounting of packets are increasingly important functionalities that need to be provided in the Internet. This document motivates and describes a framework for the path- coupled configuration of Metering Entities to record monitoring and measurement data and report it to a data collector. Different scenarios are described where such a path-coupled configuration is useful. Currently, the focus is on two scenarios: accounting and QoS measurement. Moreover, this document gathers requirements for a path-coupled configuration protocol of Metering Entities. Finally, the applicability of the NSIS architecture for this purpose is discussed. The protocol itself is specified in a separate document [I-D.dressler-nsis-metering-nslp]</t>
