      <t>The growing popularity of Internet exchange points (IXPs) brings a new set of requirements to interconnect participating networks. While bilateral exterior BGP sessions between exchange participants were previously the most common means of exchanging reachability information, the overhead associated with dense interconnection has caused substantial operational scaling problems for Internet exchange point participants. Multilateral interconnection can dramatically reduce the administrative and operational overhead of IXP participation and is now used by many IXP participants as a means of exchanging routing information. This document outlines operational considerations for multilateral interconnections at IXPs.</t>
