      <t>Data Centers offer various application services to end-users such asvideo gaming, cloud computing and others. Since the data centers usedto provide application services are distributed geographically arounda network, many decisions made in the control and management ofapplication services, such as where to instantiate another serviceinstance or to which server a new client is assigned, should be madewith the knowledge of the underlying network resources availabilityand the application resources conditions.Currently such decisions are made with very little or no informationconcerning the underlying network used to deliver those services.Hence such decisions are inherently sub-optimal. In addition the lackof network awareness may result in not meeting the end-userapplication service objectives.</t>
