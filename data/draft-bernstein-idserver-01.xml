    <abstract>
      <t>It is common for Internet hosts to associate a relatively long-lived identifier, often called a username or owner name, to each TCP connection. The Identity Server announces the identifier associated with a particular TCP connection to the host on the other end of the connection. The Identity Server may be used on any host which associates a relatively long-lived identifier to each connection.</t>
