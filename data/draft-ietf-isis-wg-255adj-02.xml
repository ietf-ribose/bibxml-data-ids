      <t>This draft describes an optional implementation technique withinIS-IS [ISO90, Cal90a, Cal90b] used today by several ISPs for routingwithin their clouds. IS-IS is an interior gateway routing protocoldeveloped originally by OSI and used with IP extensions as IGP.This draft describes how to effectively bypass the problem of 255circuits that IS-IS allows to maintain with minor violations of thespecification that however does not prevent interoperability withexisting implementations.</t>
