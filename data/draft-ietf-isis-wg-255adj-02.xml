      <t>This draft describes an optional implementation technique within IS-IS [ISO90, Cal90a, Cal90b] used today by several ISPs for routing within their clouds. IS-IS is an interior gateway routing protocol developed originally by OSI and used with IP extensions as IGP. This draft describes how to effectively bypass the problem of 255 circuits that IS-IS allows to maintain with minor violations of the specification that however does not prevent interoperability with existing implementations.</t>
