      <t>RFC 3777 specifies the process by which members of the Internet Architecture Board, Internet Engineering Steering Group and IETF Administrative Oversight Committee are selected, confirmed, and recalled. This document updates RFC 3777 to increase the number of volunteers who are eligible to serve on NomCom and to increase the selection of volunteers having different primary affiliations. It also makes some updates to include the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee.</t>
