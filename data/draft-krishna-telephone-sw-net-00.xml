      <t>This Internet Draft outlines the information to be carried by the Service Support Transfer Protocol (SSTP) running on top of a reliable transport layer (such as TCP). The SSTP is for interconnection between the Internet and the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), specifically, involving Web Server in the former; and Service Node (SN) or Service Control Point (SCP), and Service Management System (SMS) [1] in the latter. It is to support a combination of services provided otherwise disjointly by either of the network types. Service examples are those integrating the traditional telephony services on the PSTN and the World Wide Web-based services on the Internet like click-to-dial, click-to-fax, click-to-fax-back, and voice-access-to-content.</t>
