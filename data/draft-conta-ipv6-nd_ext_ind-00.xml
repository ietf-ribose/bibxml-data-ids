      <t>This memo describes a mechanism that can be seen as an extension to the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery. It allows a node to solicit and be advertized an IPv6 address corresponding to a given link-layer address. Because the known parameter is the link layer address, the mechanism is called Inverse Neighbor Discovery. It specifically applies to Frame Relay nodes that may have a Data Link Connection Identifier (DLCI), the Frame Relay equivalent of a link-layer address, associated with an established Permanent Virtual Circuit (PVC), but do not know the IPv6 address of the node at the other end of the circuit. It may also apply to other networks with similar behavior.</t>
