      <t>This document analyses the routing requirements of different types of clients, and then proposes a P2P client routing mechanism for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD). This mechanism is designed to solve the issues in one of the client routing options described in the RELOAD Base protocol [I-D.ietf-p2psip-base], where clients are allowed to connect with arbitrary peers. The solution is to store the information of a client's Attached Peer in the overlay together with the registration data of the client. The extension could be deployed on SIP usage of RELOAD easily [I-D.draft-ietf-p2psip-sip].</t>
