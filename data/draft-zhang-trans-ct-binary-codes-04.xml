    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a solution extending the Certificate Transparency protocol [I-D.ietf-trans-rfc6962-bis] for transparently logging the software binary codes (BC)or its digest with their signature, to enable anyone to monitor and audit the software provider activity and notice the distribution of suspect software as well as to audit the BC logs themselves. The solution is called "Binary Transparency" in this document.</t>
