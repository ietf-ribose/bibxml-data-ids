      <t>This document outlines a set of recommendations and guidelines for how networking software should be designed to enable the development, testing, and deployment of new protocols and protocol features. The focus is primarily on the API contract that a client-side networking library should present to applications using networking features, and how that library can be architected to maximize flexibility and longevity. Specific areas of protocol development that should be enabled include: o Making security and privacy easy to use o Reducing latency with 0-RTT protocols o Allowing wider use of multi-stream protocols o Providing a simple interface for multi-path protocols</t>
