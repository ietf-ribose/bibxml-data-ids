      <t>This document introduces an extension to allow an adapted multiple binding in hierarchical mobile network. Mobile node registers its RCoA and LCoA in the home agent at same time to get two separate connections between the mobile node and the home agent, or between the mobile node and the correspondent node in Route Optimization scenario. These connections provide robust communication between the mobile node and correspondent nodes and mobile node can overcome the failure on MAP.</t>
