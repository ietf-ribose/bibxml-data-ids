      <t>This document introduces an extension to allow an adapted multiplebinding in hierarchical mobile network. Mobile node registers itsRCoA and LCoA in the home agent at same time to get two separateconnections between the mobile node and the home agent, or betweenthe mobile node and the correspondent node in Route Optimizationscenario. These connections provide robust communication betweenthe mobile node and correspondent nodes and mobile node can overcomethe failure on MAP.</t>
