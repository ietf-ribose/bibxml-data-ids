      <t>This memo defines Management Information Bases (MIBs) for performances of provisioning Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Generalized MPLS or MPLS-TE networks. When Generalized MPLS/MPLS-TE is used to provision LSPs, it is useful to record the performance of the provisioning process, such as the delay in creating and deleting the LSPs. The managed information may be retrieved by the Management System and visualized on the GUI, so that the performance of dynamic provisioning may be monitored in a timely manner. This work is a continuation of the work in [RFC5814] and [I-D.ietf-ccamp-dpm], where the provisioning performance values are obtained through active measurements.</t>
