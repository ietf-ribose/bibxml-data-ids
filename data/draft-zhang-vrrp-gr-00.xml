      <t>Many existing routers enable their data planes to keep forwardingdata packets during the restart of their control plains. Thisfunctionality is called "graceful restart" or "non-stop forwarding".A router supporting graceful restart is able to provide more reliablepacket forwarding service during system maintaining procedures andsoftware-error recoveries. This informational document analyzes theissues with enhancing VRRP to support graceful restart and introducesseveral candidate solutions.</t>
