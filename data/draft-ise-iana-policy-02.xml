      <t>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains registries to track codepoints used by protocols such as those defined by the IETF and documented in RFCs developed on the IETF Stream. The Independent Submissions Stream is another source of documents that can be published as RFCs. This stream is under the care of the Independent Submissions Editor (ISE). This document complements RFC 4846 by providing a description of how the ISE currently handles documents in the Independent Submissions Stream that request actions from the IANA. Nothing in this document changes existing IANA registries or their allocation policies, nor does it change any previously documented processes.</t>
