    <abstract>
      <t>Some AI services drive the need to transmit RMDA packets across wide area network (WAN) via SRv6 tunnels. RoCEv2 is the most popular open standard for achieving RDMA and network offloads over ethernet, with its congestion control based on the combination of PFC and ECN. Due to certain limitations of PFC and ECN, some drafts have been put forward to realize more faster congestion notification (FANTEL). Upon detection of congestion, these drafts proposals directly sending congestion notifications to relevant nodes, enabling near real-time congestion control. However, in SRv6-based WAN environments, congestion notifications cannot be directly delivered from WAN devices to intra-DC devices. This document specifies new SRv6 Segment Identifiers (SIDs) and the corresponding processing rules for device, supporting the forwarding of congestion notification across domains.</t>
