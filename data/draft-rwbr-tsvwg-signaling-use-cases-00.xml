    <abstract>
      <t>Host-to-network (and vice versa) signaling can improve the user experience by informing the network which flows are more important and which packets within a flow are more important without having to disclose the content of the packets being delivered. The differentiated service may be provided at the network (e.g., packet discard preference), the sender (e.g., adaptive transmission or session migration), or through cooperation of both the host and the network. This document outlines a set of use-cases that highlight the need for a mechanism to share metadata about flows between a host and its network in order to enable different traffic treatment. Such a mechanism is typically implemented using a signaling protocol between the host and a set of trusted netwrok elements.</t>
