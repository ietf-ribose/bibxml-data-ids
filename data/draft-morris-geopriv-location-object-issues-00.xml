      <t>This document discusses three major questions that were posed and discussed at some length at the interim meeting in San Diego, June 2002: (1) Should geopriv facilitate the misrepresentation of location information? (2) Should the geopriv Location Object (LO) accommodate multiple locations as part of a single positioning transaction? (3) If so, should the Location Object hold multiple locations in a single object, or should the multiple locations be contained in multiple objects? In this paper we propose an answer to those questions.</t>
