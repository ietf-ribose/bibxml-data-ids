      <t>This document discusses three major questions that were posed anddiscussed at some length at the interim meeting in San Diego, June2002:(1) Should geopriv facilitate the misrepresentation of locationinformation?(2) Should the geopriv Location Object (LO) accommodate multiplelocations as part of a single positioning transaction?(3) If so, should the Location Object hold multiple locations in asingle object, or should the multiple locations be contained inmultiple objects?In this paper we propose an answer to those questions.</t>
