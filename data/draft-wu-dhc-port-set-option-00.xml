      <t>Due to the exhaustion of global IPv4 address space, there are demands arising for IPv4 address sharing between end users. In such context, different users can employ the same address, but different ports. This document defines two DHCP options for assigning a set of ports to a device. One is used for allocating continuous port set, while the other is designed for non-continuous port set allocation.</t>
