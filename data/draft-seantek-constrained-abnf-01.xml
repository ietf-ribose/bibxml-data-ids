      <t>This document extends the base definition of ABNF (Augmented Backus- Naur Form) to express a rule that is constrained by another rule. If a rule B is constrained by rule A, then every production generated by rule B must also be generated by rule A. By creating subordinate production forms, ABNF-using specifications can formally denote the relationship between a general rule and specific subsets of that rule, while preserving ABNF's context-free nature.</t>
