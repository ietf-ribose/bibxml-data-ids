      <t>This memorandum shall be entitled 'TOP LEVEL DOMAIN DELEGATION DRAFT', and describes a proposed policy, procedure and control structure for the allocation of additional top-level domains. This memorandum discusses the issues surrounding additional top level domains (TLDs), qualification proposals for operating such a registry, and justifications for the positions expressed in this paper. The IETF, IANA, NEWDOM and related mailing lists are welcome to read, and comment, on this material. Presuming a consensus can be found within these audiences, the distribution of this memorandum should be expanded to include general commentary from the Internet community.</t>
