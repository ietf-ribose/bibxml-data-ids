      <t>This documents provides a proposed definition for a supplemental package to Megaco/H.248. The proposed package addresses support of functionality to enable a MGC to store information on a MG which can subsequently be retrieved via audit. The specific purpose for storing / retrieving data in this way is regarded as being solely the concern of the MGC. This draft merely proposes the means for supporting such capability.</t>
