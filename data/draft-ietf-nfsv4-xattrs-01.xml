      <t>This document proposes extensions to the NFSv4 protocol which allow file extended attributes (hereinafter also referred to as xattrs) to be manipulated using NFSv4. An xattr is a file system feature that allows opaque metadata, not interpreted by the file system, to be associated with files and directories. Such support is present in many modern local file systems. New file attributes are proposed to allow clients to query the server for xattr support, and new operations to get and set xattrs on file system objects are provided.</t>
