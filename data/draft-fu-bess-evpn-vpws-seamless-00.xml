    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides a solution for migrating L2VPN virtual private wire service(VPWS) to Ethernet VPN Virtual Private wire service (EVPN-VPWS) over SRv6. The service provider may want to migrate L2VPN VPWS to EVPN-VPWS, and deploy EVPN-VPWS over SRv6 network. When co-existing of EVPN-VPWS over SRv6 network and a legacy L2VPN VPWS over MPLS/IP network, the next hop of the EVPN Ethernet-AD per EVI route is different from the nexthop of VPWS AD routes or the source of LDP-LM message of the legacy L2VPN VPWS. As a result, whether the pseudowire of the EVPN VPWS and legacy L2VPN VPWS is same cannot be identified by the next hop of the EVPN Ethernet-AD per EVI route and VPWS AD routes or LDM messages. This document provides a solution to identify whether the pseudowire of EVPN VPWS is same with the pseudowire of L2VPN VPWS, which allows migrating VPWS to EVPN- VPWS under the same vpn instance but over different network.</t>
