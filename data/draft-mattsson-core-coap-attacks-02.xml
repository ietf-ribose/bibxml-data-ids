    <abstract>
      <t>Being able to securely read information from sensors, to securely control actuators, and to not enable distributed denial-of-service attacks are essential in a world of connected and networking things interacting with the physical world. This document summarizes a number of known attacks on CoAP and show that just using CoAP with a security protocol like DTLS, TLS, or OSCORE is not enough for secure operation. The document also summarizes different denial-of-service attacks using CoAP. The goal with this document is motivating generic and protocol-specific recommendations on the usage of CoAP. Several of the discussed attacks can be mitigated with the solutions in draft-ietf-core-echo-request-tag.</t>
