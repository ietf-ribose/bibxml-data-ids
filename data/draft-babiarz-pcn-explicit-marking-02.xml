      <t>This document describes the simulation setups and results for testing the Three State PCN Marking approach. Simulations done to date, demonstrate that the three state PCN marking approach has certain ability to support admission control and flow termination of real- time application flows at the congestion point(s) of the PCN-enabled network. The real-time traffic used in the simulation covers voice and video traffic with large and small numbers of flows. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].</t>
