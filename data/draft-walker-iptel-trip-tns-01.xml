      <t>Conventional telephony signalling commonly uses E.164 addresses to route calls to their destination. However, selection of the signalling and media paths can be influenced by other considerations. Some such considerations may be user specified, and may differ from that which the network operator would normally choose. In some cases, support for such user-specified options may be required by national regulation. The choice of Transit Network (e.g. selection of long distance carrier) is such a case. This draft describes three ways that a Transit Network Selection (or TNS) mechanism can be added to the TRIP protocol.</t>
