    <abstract>
      <t>Mobility solutions at the IP layer have been specified in the IETF for IPv4 and IPv6. These solutions include host and network based mobility. All of the mobility protocols enable IP session continuity by providing the mobile host with an IP address or prefix that remains constant even as the host moves and attaches to different access networks and points of attachment. Mobile hosts are anchored at a gateway via a tunnel and the address/prefix provided to the host via the gateway remains unchanged across mobility events. All IP sessions initiated or terminated at a mobile host are anchored via the gateway. A gateway centric approach such as Mobile IP, raises certain concerns in terms of cost and efficiency. A mobility model wherein the network entities enabling mobility are distributed is a way of alleviating the concerns of a gateway centric approach. This document considers ways to alleviate anchored mobility issues with approaches that could be considered in a deployment.</t>
