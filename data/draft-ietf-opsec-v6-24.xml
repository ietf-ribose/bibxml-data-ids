    <abstract>
      <t>Knowledge and experience on how to operate IPv4 securely is available: whether it is the Internet or an enterprise internal network. However, IPv6 presents some new security challenges. RFC 4942 describes the security issues in the protocol, but network managers also need a more practical, operations-minded document to enumerate advantages and/or disadvantages of certain choices. This document analyzes the operational security issues associated with several types of network and proposes technical and procedural mitigation techniques. This document is only applicable to managed networks, such as enterprise building networks. The recommendations in this document are not applicable to residential user cases, even in cases where a Service Provider may be managing the home gateway.</t>
