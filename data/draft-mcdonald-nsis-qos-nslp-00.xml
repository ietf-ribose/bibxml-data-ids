      <t>This draft describes a protocol to be used for signaling QoSreservations in the Internet. It is compatible with the framework andrequirements for such signaling protocols developed within NSIS; inconjunction with the NSIS Transport solution, it providesfunctionality comparable to RSVP: it is independent of the details ofQoS specification, and adds support for a greater variety ofreservation models, but is simplified by the elimination of supportfor multicast flows.</t>
