      <t>This draft describes a protocol to be used for signaling QoS reservations in the Internet. It is compatible with the framework and requirements for such signaling protocols developed within NSIS; in conjunction with the NSIS Transport solution, it provides functionality comparable to RSVP: it is independent of the details of QoS specification, and adds support for a greater variety of reservation models, but is simplified by the elimination of support for multicast flows.</t>
