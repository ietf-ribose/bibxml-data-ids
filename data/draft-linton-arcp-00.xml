      <t>Automatic Router Configuration Protocol is a method by which Routersmay be automatically configured according to a predefined or defaultscheme of behavior and address allocation. It is routing protocolindependent and is based on on a Client-Server model, working inconjunction with DHCP [2] and using a system of IP messages forcommunication between participating Router Clients and Servers. It iseasy to use as a labor-saving device in less secure environments andwill work even in conjunction with unmodified DHCP Serverimplementations. However, it also has inherent security features andis capable of highly secure implementation.</t>
