      <t>Automatic Router Configuration Protocol is a method by which Routers may be automatically configured according to a predefined or default scheme of behavior and address allocation. It is routing protocol independent and is based on on a Client-Server model, working in conjunction with DHCP [2] and using a system of IP messages for communication between participating Router Clients and Servers. It is easy to use as a labor-saving device in less secure environments and will work even in conjunction with unmodified DHCP Server implementations. However, it also has inherent security features and is capable of highly secure implementation.</t>
