    <abstract>
      <t>As the rapid development of internet, massive data are produced. Service providers typically need to deploy services near the edge networks to better satisfy user_s demand. In order to obtain better quality of the networks, computing functions and user traffic need to be scheduled properly. However, it is challenging to efficiently schedule resources among the distributed edge servers because of the lack of network information, such as network topology, traffic distribution, link delay/bandwidth and utilization/capability of computing servers. In this standard, we employed the ALTO protocol to help deliver functions and schedule traffic at the edge computing platform. This protocol supplied information of multiple resources for the distributed edge computing platform, thus enhancing the efficiency of function delivery in edge computing platform.</t>
