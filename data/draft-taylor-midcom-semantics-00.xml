      <t>This document is written to aid the process of selecting and completing the definition of the MIDCOM protocol, which will operate between MIDCOM Agents and Middleboxes such as firewalls and NATs. It describes the semantics which the protocol must support. These semantics are derived from the MIDCOM requirements and the MIDCOM usage scenarios which helped to inspire the requirements. This is intended to be a working document of the IETF Middlebox Communications (MIDCOM) Working Group.</t>
