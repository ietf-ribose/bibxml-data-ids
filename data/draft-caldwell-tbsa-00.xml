      <t>This document proposes a trusted browser security model intended to secure the mutual automated consent between the end-user and the content provider before allowing a web browser to engage the services of an arbitrary third-party add-on, extension or service. Properly implemented, this proposed security model would create a standardized API across all browsers to further the security of e-commerce and other on-line transactions.</t>
