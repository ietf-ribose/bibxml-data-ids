      <t>Further explanation and analysis of architectural recommendations contained in the recent Internet-Draft, Marker PDU Aligned Framing for TCP Specification [MPA], is provided. The impact of the following three attributes of MPA over TCP is examined: * packing of multiple DDP ULPDUs into one TCP segment; * simplifying the receiver due to transmitter alignment of DDP headers with TCP headers; and * mistakenly attempting to interoperate an MPA-enabled endpoint with a non-MPA-enabled endpoint.</t>
