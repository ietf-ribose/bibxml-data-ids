      <t>Moq-Lite is designed to fanout live content from publishers to any number of subscribers across the internet. Liveliness is achieved by using QUIC to prioritize the most important content, potentially starving or dropping other content, to avoid head-of-line blocking while respecting encoding dependencies. While designed for media, it is an agnostic transport, allowing relays and CDNs to forward content without knowledge of codecs, containers, or encryption keys.</t>
