      <t>The nominal Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the Internet hasbecome 1500 bytes, but existing IP/*/IP tunneling mechanisms imposean encapsulation overhead that can reduce the effective path MTU tosmaller values. Additionally, existing tunneling mechanisms arelimited in their ability to discover and utilize larger MTUs. Thisdocument specifies a trivial mechanism for tunnel MTU determinationthat addresses these issues.1. IntroductionThe nominal Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of today's Internet hasbecome 1500 bytes due to the preponderance of networking gear thatconfigures an MTU of that size. Since not all links in the Internetconfigure a 1500 byte MTU, however, packets can be dropped due to anMTU restriction on the path.Upper layers see IP/*/IP tunnels as ordinary links, but even forpackets no larger than 1500 bytes these links are susceptible tosilent loss (e.g., due to path MTU restrictions, lost error messages,layered encapsulations, reassembly buffer limitations, etc.)resulting in poor performance and/or communications failures[RFC2923][RFC4459][RFC4821][RFC4963].This document specifies a trivial mechanism for IP/*/IP tunnel MTUdetermination. It updates the functional specifications for TunnelEndpoints (TEs) found in existing tunneling mechanisms (see:Section 9).</t>
