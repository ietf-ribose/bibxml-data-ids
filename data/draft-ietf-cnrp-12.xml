    <abstract>
      <t>People often refer to things in the real world by a common name orphrase, e.g., a trade name, company name, or a book title. Thesenames are sometimes easier for people to remember and type thanURLs. Furthermore, because of the limited syntax of URLs, companiesand individuals are finding that the ones that might be mostreasonable for their resources are being used elsewhere and so areunavailable. For the purposes of this document, a 'common name' is aword or a phrase, without imposed syntactic structure, that may beassociated with a resource.</t>
