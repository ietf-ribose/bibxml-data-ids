      <t>This document proposes an enhanced certificate profile for trustanchors, in which the issuer field of the TA certificate iscryptographically generated. In the RPKI architecture, the trustanchor uses self-signed certificate. However, this sort ofcertificate is vulnerable to various attacks. For example, theattackers can easily create its own public-private key pair anddeclaims that the issuer field belongs to him. This means attackerscan easily impersonate the trust anchor. To address it, thisdocument adds identity based cryptographic technique to the self-signed certificate. Since the issuer field of the trust anchor'scertificate is cryptographically generated from the trust anchor'spublic key, the attacker will not be able to create another key pairand declaim that the issuer field generated by the trust anchorbelongs to him. Therefore, attackers can not impersonate the trustanchor.</t>
