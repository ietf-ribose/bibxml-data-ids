      <t>When the Public-Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Working Group was chartered, an object identifier arc was allocated by IANA for use by that working group. RFC 7299 describes the object identifiers that were assigned in that arc. A small number of object identifiers that were assigned in RFC 4212 are not included in RFC 7299, and this document corrects that oversight. This document updates RFC 7299.</t>
