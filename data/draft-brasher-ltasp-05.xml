      <t>Long-term archiving storage fundamentally begins with archive data Accumulation, then Geo-duplication and then Management. Using A-&gt;G-&gt;M, LTASP has been created to solve mid-range and below, long- term archiving requirements of the small-medium enterprise. Where tape has been deployed in the past, LTASP now offers an alternative solution designed to be more robust and manageable in the long term than network attached storage devices or simple disk storage alone.</t>
