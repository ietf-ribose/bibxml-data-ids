      <t>Efficient transmission of voice over wireless links requires significant engineering effort. Because of the high cost of bandwidth on such links, special techniques for compression of voice data and its transmission over the air have been developed. The compression techniques and the wireless physical layers have been co-designed for maximum spectral efficiency and human perceptual euphony.</t>
