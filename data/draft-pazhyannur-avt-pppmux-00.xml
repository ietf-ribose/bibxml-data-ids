      <t>This draft proposes a scheme to increase the capacity of low-speedtransmission links, T-1/E-1 or smaller, to transport low-bit ratevoice applications over PPP. Given the relatively small payload sizeof the voice packets (average of 8 bytes for certain cellularnetworks) protocol overheads due to PPP, IP, UDP, and RTP aresignificant in determining the link capacity. The scheme proposedhere is to multiplex compressed RTP/UDP packets into a single PPPframe. As a result, the PPP overhead (5-7 bytes) is distributed overmultiple compressed RTP/UDP packets.</t>
