      <t>This draft proposes a scheme to increase the capacity of low-speed transmission links, T-1/E-1 or smaller, to transport low-bit rate voice applications over PPP. Given the relatively small payload size of the voice packets (average of 8 bytes for certain cellular networks) protocol overheads due to PPP, IP, UDP, and RTP are significant in determining the link capacity. The scheme proposed here is to multiplex compressed RTP/UDP packets into a single PPP frame. As a result, the PPP overhead (5-7 bytes) is distributed over multiple compressed RTP/UDP packets.</t>
