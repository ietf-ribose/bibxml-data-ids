    <abstract>
      <t>A consistent reference architecture model for the Quantum Internet is required to progress in its evolution, providing a framework for the integration of the protocols applicable to it, and enabling the advance of the applications based on it. This model has to satisfy three essential requirements: agility, so it is able to adapt to the evolution of quantum communications base technologies, sustainability, with open availability in technological and economical terms, and pliability, being able to integrate with the operations and management procedures in current networks. This document proposes such an architecture framework, with the goal of providing a conceptual common framework for the integration of technologies intended to build the Quantum Internet infrastructure and its integration with the current Internet. The framework is based on the already extensive experience in the deployment of QKD network infrastructures and on related initiatives focused on the integration of network infrastructures and services.</t>
