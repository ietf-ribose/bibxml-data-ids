      <t>This document proposes a mechanism, IVIT (IVI+Tunnel), to supportnon-IVI IPv6 hosts to communicate with IPv4 hosts, and vice versa.IVIT combines IVI translation and Tunnel methods with the IVItranslation at the core and the tunnel at the edge. In thisdocument, IVIT provides two modes. One is the dual-stack host mode,which supports the communication between a dual-stack host in an IPv4network and a non-IVI IPv6 host, especially the communicationscenario between a dual-stack server in an IPv4 network and a non-IVIIPv6 host. The other is the CPE mode, which supports thecommunication between an IPv4-only host and a non-IVI IPv6 host,especially the bidirectional communication scenario between a privateIPv4 network and a non-IVI IPv6 network. Combined with IVI, IVIT cansupport the communication between IPv4 networks and IPv6 networksstatelessly at the core.</t>
