      <t>The IAB has published [RFC7624] in response to several revelations of pervasive attack on Internet communications. In this document we survey the mitigations to those threats which are currently available or which might plausibly be deployed. We discuss these primarily in the context of Internet protocol design, focusing on robustness to pervasive monitoring and avoidance of unwanted cross-mitigation impacts.</t>
