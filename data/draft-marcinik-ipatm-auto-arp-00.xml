    <abstract>
      <t>This memo describes an extension to RFC 1577 [1] that allows an ATMARP client to automatically locate its ATMARP server. This procedure is facilitated through the use of ATM anycast addressing [2]. ATMARP clients use a LIS-specific anycast address to locate their LIS-designated ATMARP Server. Both an ATMARP client and an ATMARP server algorithmically determine their LIS-specific anycast address upon restart. The use of this procedure will significantly relieve the administrative burden currently required to (re)configure a Classical IP network.</t>
