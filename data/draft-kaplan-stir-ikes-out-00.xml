      <t>This document describes a mechanism and format for signing source identity information of communication requests, in a manner capable of crossing multiple communication protocol types - even if the origin's protocol type is unknown. This is useful for providing E.164 and other forms of Caller-ID reputability for various communication protocols, such as SIP, XMPP, WebRTC, H.323, and SS7/ISUP.</t>
