      <t>The Border Gateway Protocol, version 4, (BGP4) provides the means to advertise reachability for IP prefixes. This reachability information is propagated in a peer-to-peer topology. Sometimes routes are announced to peers for which the local peering policy does not permit. And sometimes routes are propagated indiscriminantly, once they have been accepted. This document is a requirements document for detection of (and prevention of) route leaks. Together with the definitions document, it is intended to suggest solutions which meet these criteria, and to facilitate evaluation of proposed solutions. The fundamental objective is to "solve the route leaks problem".</t>
