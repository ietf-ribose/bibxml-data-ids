      <t>This memo proposes a way of transporting NETCONF over WebSocket protocol. Web-based systems are increasing with the advancement of Web technologies and emergence of cloud computing. Management systems that support browser-based interface are also getting common. It's natural to expect network devices to have browser-based managemaent interface. Currently, however, few network management protocols support being transported over HTTP. NETCONF[RFC6241] was defined to be sent over SOAP/HTTPS[RFC4743]. But, it falls short of fulfilling NETCONF specification in that it can't provide NETCONF notification[RFC5277] because of HTTP's lack of bi-directional capabilty. At present, WebSocket protocol, the update of HTTP with bi-directional capability, is available[RFC6455]. This memo describes the way NETCONF is sent over WebSocket protocol.</t>
