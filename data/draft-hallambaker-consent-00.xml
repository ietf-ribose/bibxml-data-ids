    <abstract>
      <t>We propose a mechanism Proof of Consent that allows an email recipient to provide verifiable proof of ‘opt-in’ consent to receive email. Proof of Consent may be used to automatically whitelist email from mailing lists and email forwarded from another email server. Proof of Consent is designed to require minimal state maintenance by both the email sender and the recipient and to be deployable with minimal impact on existing email infrastructure.</t>
