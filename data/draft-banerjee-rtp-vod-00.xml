      <t>This memorandum specifies an extension to RTP and RTCP as specified in RFC 1889 [1] specifically designed to extend support to Video-on-Demand systems in particular and unicast systems in general. It is presented through an experimental Video-on-Demand Architecture that supports dynamic changes in the distribution pattern and load balancing to optimize the service quality provided to the user.</t>
