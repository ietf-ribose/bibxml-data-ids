      <t>When the procedures per [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-srv6-egress-protection] are applied to EVPN services, the egress-protection on PLR is typically more faster than the new DF node of the affected ESI is re-elected. As a result of that, replicated BUM packets will be sent to the CEs of the affected ES. This draft describes a "NDF-bias" mechanism that is used to avoid such excessive BUM packets.</t>
