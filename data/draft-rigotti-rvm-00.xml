      <t>This memo presents extensions to IP that enable the use of source-baseddistribution trees (such as those established by DVMRP[1] or PIM-DM[2])to deliver multicast packets generated by members of a multicast groupin the opposite direction to packets originated by the source (S).Packets generated by a member M of a group G are forwarded (unicast)from an in-tree router to another, towards the source S.In addition to send the packet to its upstream, each in-tree router injects it into the multicast tree (S,G). This enables packets to reach the rest of the receivers, as S would originate them.The 'reversed' use of the distribution tree is intended for sending oflow volume feedback information produced by receivers in applicationssuch as RTP/RTCP[3] and reliable multicast.This feature diminish the overhead in routers in case of applicationswith a source and many receivers sending feedback, because only onedistribution tree, rooted at the sender S must be maintained, in placeof one per member.In addition, multicast packets originated by receivers,travel throughthe inverse path of information ones in the distribution tree.This can be exploited by multicast transport protocols to localizeprocesses to subtrees or to reduce exposure.</t>
