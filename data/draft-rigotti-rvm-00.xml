      <t>This memo presents extensions to IP that enable the use of source-based distribution trees (such as those established by DVMRP[1] or PIM-DM[2]) to deliver multicast packets generated by members of a multicast group in the opposite direction to packets originated by the source (S). Packets generated by a member M of a group G are forwarded (unicast) from an in-tree router to another, towards the source S. In addition to send the packet to its upstream, each in-tree router injects it into the multicast tree (S,G). This enables packets to reach the rest of the receivers, as S would originate them. The 'reversed' use of the distribution tree is intended for sending of low volume feedback information produced by receivers in applications such as RTP/RTCP[3] and reliable multicast. This feature diminish the overhead in routers in case of applications with a source and many receivers sending feedback, because only one distribution tree, rooted at the sender S must be maintained, in place of one per member. In addition, multicast packets originated by receivers,travel through the inverse path of information ones in the distribution tree. This can be exploited by multicast transport protocols to localize processes to subtrees or to reduce exposure.</t>
