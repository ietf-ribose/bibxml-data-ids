      <t>This document discusses TCP/IP traffic on ISDN links and makes recommendations to Network Application and Router developers with a view to reducing the cost of using ISDN. This topic is partly related to current activity in the PPP Working Group on controls for Protocol Spoofing, but mainly targets the developers of Network software such as Resource Sharing protocols, for example Network Service and Directory Sharing.</t>
