    <abstract>
      <t>Traffic flows may be categorized and described using "Flow Specifications". RFC8955 defines the Flow Specification and describes how Flow Specification components are used to describe traffic flows. RFC8955 also defines how Flow Specifications may be distributed in BGP to allow specific traffic flows to be associated with routes. The flow specification protocol defined in RFC8955, RFC8956, RFC9117 is called BGP flow specification version 1 (BGP FSv1). RFC9168 specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support the dissemination of Flow Specifications. This allows a PCE to indicate what traffic should be placed on each path that it is aware of. RFC9168 inherits the BGP Flow Spec registry and ordering rules as well as the limitations in BGP FSv1. This document proposes extensions to PCEP to add the support of Flow Specification v2 to allow the user to order the flow specification rules.</t>
