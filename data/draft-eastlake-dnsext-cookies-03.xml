      <t>DNS cookies are a light-weight DNS transaction security mechanism designed for incremental deployment. They provide limited protection to DNS servers and resolvers against a variety of increasingly common denial-of-service and cache poisoning or forgery attacks by off-path attackers. DNS Cookies are tolerant of NAT, NAT-PT, and Anycast.</t>
