      <t>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a widely used transport for real-time media on IP networks. The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) is a newly defined transport protocol that provides desirable services for real-time applications. This memo specifies a mapping of RTP onto DCCP, along with associated signalling, such that real-time applications can make use of the services provided by DCCP.</t>
