      <t>Many Internet applications have a need for object-based security mechanisms in addition to security mechanisms at the network layer or transport layer. In the past, the Cryptographic Message Syntax has provided a binary secure object format based on ASN.1. Over time, the use of binary object encodings such as ASN.1 has been overtaken by text-based encodings, for example JavaScript Object Notation. This document defines a set of use cases and requirements for a secure object format encoded using JavaScript Object Notation, drawn from a variety of application security mechanisms currently in development.</t>
