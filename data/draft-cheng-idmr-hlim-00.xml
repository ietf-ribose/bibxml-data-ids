      <t>This document proposes and describes a new IP multicast routingprotocol, called 'Hierarchical Level-based IP Multicast' (HLIM). Itis designed for a hierarchical IP network and leverages thehierarchical structure to provide efficient IP multicasting. It isoriginally designed for tactical networks in battlefields but some ofits functions could be applied to commercial networks as well.Besides the basic support for multicast in static environments, HLIMsupports host mobility (movements of IP multicast hosts) and networkmobility (movements of IP multicast routers with/without hosts).Since HLIM is designed for harsh environments, reliability andsurvivability functions are also built into HLIM.</t>
