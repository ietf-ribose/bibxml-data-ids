      <t>This document proposes and describes a new IP multicast routing protocol, called 'Hierarchical Level-based IP Multicast' (HLIM). It is designed for a hierarchical IP network and leverages the hierarchical structure to provide efficient IP multicasting. It is originally designed for tactical networks in battlefields but some of its functions could be applied to commercial networks as well. Besides the basic support for multicast in static environments, HLIM supports host mobility (movements of IP multicast hosts) and network mobility (movements of IP multicast routers with/without hosts). Since HLIM is designed for harsh environments, reliability and survivability functions are also built into HLIM.</t>
