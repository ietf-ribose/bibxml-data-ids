    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the changes required to make it possible for working group chairs to update the I-D tracker during document shepherding, after the request for publication. It also describes additional requirements for the chairs to use the I-D tracker for managing WG documents from their earliest stages. Having the tracker support the working groups more fully is a primary benefit, but in addition, this moves towards the goal of providing an integrated view of document states from -00 to RFC publication.</t>
