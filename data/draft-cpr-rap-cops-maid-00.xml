      <t>This document describes an architecture for the communication between Border Routers (BR) and a Bandwidth Broker (BB) in a MPLS/DiffServ core network. This architecture is based on the Common Open Policy Service (COPS) protocol and defines a new Client Type extension for it. This specification applies basically to intra-domain MPLS/DiffServ network scenarios. However, the same extensions to COPS are suitable for inter-domain communications, when MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSP) with QoS-DiffServ guarantees are established across multiple MPLS/DiffServ islands. Therefore, this document provides also a simple and efficient model for inter-BB communication.</t>
