      <t>The Network-Infrastructure Hiding Protocol (NHP) is a cryptography- based session-layer protocol designed to operationalize Zero Trust principles by concealing protected network resources from unauthorized entities. NHP enforces authentication-before-connect access control, rendering IP addresses, ports, and domain names invisible to unauthorized users. This document defines the protocol architecture, cryptographic framework, message formats, and workflow to enable independent implementation of NHP. It represents the third generation of network hiding technology—evolving from first- generation port knocking to second-generation Single-Packet Authorization (SPA) and now to NHP with advanced asymmetric cryptography, mutual authentication, and scalability for modern threats. This specification also provides guidance for integration with Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP), DNS, FIDO, and Zero Trust policy engines.</t>
