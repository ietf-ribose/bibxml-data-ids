      <t>RFC 4090 specifies an RSVP facility-backup fast reroute mechanism for protecting established LSPs against link and node failures. This document extends the mechanism to provide so-called "setup protection" for LSPs during their initial Path message signaling time. In particular, it enables a router to reroute an LSP via an existing bypass LSP, when there is a failure of the immediate downstream link or node along the desired path. Therefore, it can be used to reduce LSP setup time in such a situation, or allow LSPs with strict paths to be established successfully when alternative paths are unavailable in the network or unable to be computed by ingress.</t>
