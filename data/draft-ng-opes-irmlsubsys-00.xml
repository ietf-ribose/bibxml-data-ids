      <t>The Intermediary Rule Markup Language (IRML) [2] is an XML-based language that can be used to describe service-specific execution rules for network edge intermediaries under the Open Pluggable Edge Services (OPES) framework, as described in [3] and [4]. This memo discusses the need for OPES framework to have different sub-systems in different deployment scenario, and proposes additions to IRML for a more flexible approach to supporting different sub-systems.</t>
