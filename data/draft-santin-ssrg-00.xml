      <t>This document describes the Scalable Streaming Raster Graphics (SSRG) specification for the modern Web. An unfortunate truth of the modern internet is that digital equity has been secondary to the expansion of broadband in the most developed areas of the world. This in turn makes it much harder for developing nations to gain a competitive foothold in the digital market due to lackluster download speeds limiting access to content-rich applications and educational resources. The SSRG specification, dubbed "Surge" by its creator, intends to bridge "The Digital Divide" using techniques of classical quadtree image compression and Laplacian image pyramids to create a more scalable and equitable browsing experience for low-bandwidth users while still providing standard features such as perceptually lossless image quality at competitive compression rates. The format efficiently encodes a multi-resolution version of the stored image that can be streamed sequentially in order of increasing pixel resolution using conventional mechanisms of the HTTP protocol. The specification comes in three main parts:</t>
