      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) events framework enablesreceiving asynchronous notification of various events from other SIPuser agents. This framework defines the procedures for creating,refreshing and terminating subscriptions, as well as fetching andperiodic polling of resource state. These procedures have a seriousdeficiency in that they provide no tools to avoid replaying eventnotifications that have already been received by a user agent. Thismemo defines an extension to SIP events that allows the subscriber tocondition the subscription request to whether the state has changedsince the previous notification was received. When such a conditionis true, either the body of a resulting event notification or theentire notification message is suppressed.</t>
