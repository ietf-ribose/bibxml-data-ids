      <t>The Internet Storage Name Service (iSNS) provides a generic framework for configuring and managing various storage entities and their usage attributes in an IP-based storage network. iSNS integrates Fibre Channel name server and DNS mechanisms into a common naming and resource-discovery framework. The iSNS Protocol (iSNSP) defines how entities communicate with the iSNS server to discover and utilize available networked storage resources. The iSNS server MAY be supported by a consolidated iSNS directory database, which serves as a repository to store information about various storage resources, providing easy access to topology information for storage entities.</t>
