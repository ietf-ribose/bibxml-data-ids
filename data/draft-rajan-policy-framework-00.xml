      <t>Many new protocols defined in the IETF have a regulatory component, i.e., network administrators have to decide what users, applications or hosts should have access to what resources/services under what conditions. Large-scale deployment of services using such protocols is critically dependent on the presence of a network-wide policy infrastructure that allows Internet Service Providers (ISPs)and corporate administrators to regulate the network rather than configure individual devices. A key component of this effort is to evolve standards-based means of representing and storing policy information in a unified manner, with a focus on schema for storing policy information in directories. This document presents concepts, terminology,a policy framework and requirements for such a definition.</t>
