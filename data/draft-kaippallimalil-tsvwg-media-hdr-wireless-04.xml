    <abstract>
      <t>Wireless networks like 5G cellular or Wi-Fi experience significant variations in link capacity over short intervals due to wireless channel conditions, interference, or the end-user's movement. These variations in capacity take place in the order of hundreds of milliseconds and is much too fast for end-to-end congestion signaling by itself to convey the changes for an application to adapt. Media applications on the other hand demand both high throughput and low latency, and may adjust the size and quality of a stream to network bandwidth available or dynamic change in content coded. However, catering to such media flows over a radio link with rapid changes in capacity requires the buffers and congestion to be managed carefully. Wireless networks need additional information to manage radio resources optimally to maximize network utilization and application performance. This draft provides requirements on metadata about the media transported, its scalability, privacy, and other related considerations.</t>
