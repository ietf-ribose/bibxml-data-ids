      <t>CoAP Simple Management Protocol (CSMP) is purpose-built to provide lifecycle management for resource constrained IoT devices deployed within large-scale, bandwidth constrained IoT networks. CSMP offers an efficient transport and message encoding supporting classic NMS functions such as device on-boarding, device configuration, device status reporting, securing the network, etc. This document describes the design and operation of CSMP. This document does not represent an IETF consensus.</t>
