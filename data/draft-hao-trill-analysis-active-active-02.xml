      <t>Draft [TRILL-Active-PS] lists basic problems which any active-active solutions should address, these problems include frame duplications, loop, MAC address flip-flop and unsynchronized information among member RBridges. For each problem, there may be multiple ways to deal with it. Some solutions solve all or most of the problems listed, and at the same time introduces extra issues.
