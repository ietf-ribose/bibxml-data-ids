    <abstract>
      <t>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a mechanism for creating shared, secret, random bits. This document describes extensions to the IKEv2 protocol to use random bits created via QKD as keys for IPsec. The Diffie-Hellman key agreement mechanism is replaced with QKD. The use of QKD-generated keys with standard IPsec will extend the lifetime of privacy guarantees for IPsec-protected data: future technological advances that break Diffie-Hellman key exchange will not disclose data until such time as the encryption algorithm used for the IPsec tunnel is broken.</t>
