      <t>This document presents a framework in which gateways (points ofinterconnection between the Public Switched Telephone Network andInternet-based telephone systems) register themselves with a locationservice in order to communicate their own availability and theavailability of the resources and services they provide. Unlikeprevious approaches to this problem, this document considers trunkgroups as a resource which gateways register.</t>
