      <t>Zero Configuration (Zeroconf) Networks are a particular class ofTCP/IP networks that may be established in the home, in small offices oreven for a variety of adhoc purposes. Zeroconf networks do not have andshould not be expected to have user configurable network infrastructuresuch as DHCP, DNS and other administered network services. This isbecause typical zeroconf network users neither have the skill nor thedesire to configure, administer or manage a network [1].The IETF Zeroconf Requirements draft [1] presents the zeroconfprotocol requirements for 4 areas: IP host configuration, domain name toIP address resolution, IP multicast address allocation, and servicediscovery. This draft builds on [1] and lists the zeroconf protocolrequirements for IP router configuration and dynamic routing protocol inmulti-router zeroconf networks.The IETF Zeroconf Requirements draft [1] presents the zeroconfprotocol requirements for 4 areas: IP host configuration, domain name toIP address resolution, IP multicast address allocation, and servicediscovery. The most complex network topology addressed by the ZeroconfRequirements document [1] is a multi-segment zeroconf network connectedby a single router. This drafts builds on that draft and lists thezeroconf protocol requirements for IP router configuration and dynamicrouting protocols in multi-router zeroconf networks.</t>
