    <abstract>
      <t>Label-distribution protocol (LDP) is defined in [1] for the distribution of labels inside one MPLS domain. CR-LDP is defined in [2] to work in conjunction with the LDP for establishing label switched paths with prescribed QoS requirements. The establishment of those paths is called constraint-based routing (CR) and it offers the opportunity to extend the information used to setup paths beyond what is available for the routing protocol. To facilitate the establishment of CR paths, the CR-LDP specification include the essential entries (TLVs) to allow the characterization of the traffic requirements and service expectations. The objectives of this draft are to establish a general framework for service definition using the mechanisms specified in [2] and to illustrate how service interworking could be achieved between an MPLS domain using CR-LDP and other domains that might employ similar or different networking technologies.</t>
