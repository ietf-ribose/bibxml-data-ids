One such strategyis proposed as being "optimal", when viewed from the perspective ofspace-packing efficiency. This Draft recommends use of thistechnique as a "Best Current Practice", for both IPv4 and IPv6address allocations.Author's NoteThis Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft or a relateddraft(s) being placed on the Informational Track for v6ops.The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in [2]</t>
