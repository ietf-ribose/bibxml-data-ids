      <t>This Internet Draft describes, analyzes, and compares different strategies for allocating addresses, in a way that can be generalized for any power-of-two sized, binary address space. One such strategy is proposed as being "optimal", when viewed from the perspective of space-packing efficiency. This Draft recommends use of this technique as a "Best Current Practice", for both IPv4 and IPv6 address allocations.Author's Note This Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft or a related draft(s) being placed on the Informational Track for v6ops. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [2]</t>
