      <t>This draft will eventually recommend a minimal set of IETF Transport Services offered by end systems supporting TAPS, and give guidance on choosing among the available mechanisms and protocols. It categorizes the set of transport services given in the TAPS document draft-ietf-taps-transports-usage-00, assuming that the eventual minimal set of transport services will be based on a similar form of categorization.</t>
