      <t>NetFlow Export Version 9 Export is defined in the internet draft draft-claise-netflow-9 [NFv9], which describes how to transport NetFlow over UDP [RFC768]. This document describes how NetFlow would use SCTP [RFC2960] as a transport protocol. Traditionally NetFlow was transmitted over UDP to a physically closely located collector. As the networks grow this is not necessarily the case any longer, so issues like congestion avoidance and reliability are becoming an increasing issue for applications using NetFlow. This document addresses these issues in a simple way using the SCTP protocol.</t>
