      <t>NetFlow Export Version 9 Export is defined in the internet draftdraft-claise-netflow-9 [NFv9], which describes how to transportNetFlow over UDP [RFC768]. This document describes how NetFlowwould use SCTP [RFC2960] as a transport protocol.Traditionally NetFlow was transmitted over UDP to a physicallyclosely located collector. As the networks grow this is notnecessarily the case any longer, so issues like congestionavoidance and reliability are becoming an increasing issue forapplications using NetFlow. This document addresses these issues ina simple way using the SCTP protocol.</t>
