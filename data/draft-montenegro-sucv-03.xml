      <t>This document addresses the identifier ownership problem. It does so by using characteristics of Statistic Uniqueness and Cryptographic Verifiability (SUCV) of certain entities which this document calls SUCV Identifiers (SUCV ID's). This note also proposes using these SUCV characteristics in related entities called SUCV Addresses in order to severely limit certain classes of denial of service attacks and hijacking attacks. SUCV addresses are particularly applicable to solve the 'address ownership' problem that severely undermines confidence in mechanisms like Binding Updates in Mobile IP for IPv6.</t>
