    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the Data Access and Collaboration Protocol (DACP), a communication protocol designed to support cross-node, cross-process data access in scientific and distributed computing environments. DACP provides standardized streaming-based data interactions over the Arrow Flight protocol and defines a unified Streaming DataFrame (SDF) model, which acts as a high-performance abstraction for accessing and processing both structured and unstructured data.</t>
