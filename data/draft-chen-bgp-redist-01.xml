    <abstract>
      <t>In this document we present several examples of non-deterministic routing behavior involving route redistribution into BGP. In order to eliminate such non-deterministic behavior, we propose an enhancement to BGP route selection that would take into account the administrative distance under certain conditions. We also recommend that the LOCAL_PREF value be reduced for the redistributed backup route, and be calculated automatically based on the administrative distance.</t>
