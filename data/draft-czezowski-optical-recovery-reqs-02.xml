      <t>This draft describes requirements for control plane-based recovery from data plane failures in pre-OTN networks. pre-OTN networks are transport networks that have a GMPLS-based control plane and various transport plane technologies (such as Optical Cross Connects and Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers, etc.) An important feature of these networks is recovery from failures - using either a protection or restoration scheme. Achieving recovery under strict time constraints is a difficult problem. Shared mesh-based recovery is especially desirable for reducing spare capacity ratios and achieving flexible recovery scenarios. Following a brief overview and consideration of the requirements, they are presented in an itemized list in section 3.4 of this document.</t>
