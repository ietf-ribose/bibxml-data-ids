    <abstract>
      <t>While DNS highly depends on cache, its cache usage of non-existence information has been limited to exact matching. This draft proposes the aggressive use of a NSEC/NSEC3 resource record, which is able to express non-existence of a range of names authoritatively. With this proposal, it is expected that shorter latency to many of negative responses as well as some level of mitigation of random sub-domain attacks (referred to as "Water Torture" attacks). It is also expected that non-existent TLD queries to Root DNS servers will decrease.</t>
