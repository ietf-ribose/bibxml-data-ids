      <t>There is not currently any standardized method of dealing with distributed or other large scale threats other than individual firewall and/or null routing instructions. This Internet Draft describes an optional BGP Capability (as defined by RFC 5492) that allowed Autonomous Systems to self-censor utilizing the existing Inter-Domain Routing system. This capability does not add any automatic actions and must be explicitly activated by an administrator.</t>
