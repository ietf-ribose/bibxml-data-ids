      <t>Over the last year of work, the SIMPLE group has tried to answer the question of "what is a tuple". This document tries to answer that question by proposing an abstract data model for presence, and then mapping that data model onto the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF). It then discusses the operations of publication, composition, filtering as they relate to presence data processing.</t>
