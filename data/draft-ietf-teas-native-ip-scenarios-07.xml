      <t>The requirements for the End to End(E2E) performance assurance are emerging within the service provider network, there are various solutions to meet such demands, but there is no one solution can meet these requirements in native IP network, especially one universal solution can cover intra-domain and inter-domain scenarios together. This document describes the scenarios and simulation results for Path Computation Elements (PCE) in native IP network, which integrates the advantage of distributed protocols, and the power of centrally control technologies to provide one feasible traffic engineering solution in various complex scenarios for the service provider.</t>
