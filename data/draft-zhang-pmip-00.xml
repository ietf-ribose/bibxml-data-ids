      <t>As the number of Mobile IP users grow so will the signaling overhead on the core IP network in support of mobility management. In cellular networks registration and paging techniques are used to minimize the signaling overhead and optimize the mobility management performance. Currently, Mobile IP supports registration but not paging. We believe that Mobile IP support for paging is important to improve the scalability of Mobile IP networks. Recently, a number of micro- mobility protocols [8] have been proposed that have built-in paging functions. These micro-mobility protocols are independent of the base Mobile IP protocol and interwork with Mobile IP [2] through mobile gateways. We take a different approach and propose a minimal set of paging extensions to the base Mobile IP called P-MIP. P-MIP is designed to reduce signaling load in the core Internet and power consumption of mobile nodes. In this draft, P-MIP, which assumes the use of foreign agents, is described and the construction of paging areas, movement detection, registration, paging and data handling are presented.</t>
