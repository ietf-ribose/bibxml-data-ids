      <t>As the number of Mobile IP users grow so will the signaling overheadon the core IP network in support of mobility management. In cellularnetworks registration and paging techniques are used to minimize thesignaling overhead and optimize the mobility management performance.Currently, Mobile IP supports registration but not paging. We believethat Mobile IP support for paging is important to improve thescalability of Mobile IP networks. Recently, a number of micro-mobility protocols [8] have been proposed that have built-in pagingfunctions. These micro-mobility protocols are independent of the baseMobile IP protocol and interwork with Mobile IP [2] through mobilegateways. We take a different approach and propose a minimal set ofpaging extensions to the base Mobile IP called P-MIP. P-MIP isdesigned to reduce signaling load in the core Internet and powerconsumption of mobile nodes. In this draft, P-MIP, which assumes theuse of foreign agents, is described and the construction of pagingareas, movement detection, registration, paging and data handling arepresented.</t>
