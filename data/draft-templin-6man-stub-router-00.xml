      <t>The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol [RFC4861] specifies theoperation of routers, including the process of sending and receivingRouter Advertisement (RA) messages. However, the specification makesno distinction between different classes of routers that may occur ona link. In particular, the specification is written from theperspective of routers that are "authoritative for the link", i.e.,routers that connect the link to provider networks. This documentdiscusses considerations for a different class of routers known as"stub routers".Status of this MemoThis Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with theprovisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet EngineeringTask Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.
