      <t>The Internet is becoming an increasingly commercial arena in which information is being bought and sold and payments are rendered for services and data delivered within the Internet and for goods and services to be delivered outside of the Internet. Thus far, the protocols and format used for such payments have been ad hoc and proprietary. This draft proposes a uniform application level syntax to support commerce in applications level data and services Proposed specifications are given for how this syntax fits into and enables commerce in the data and services rendered by the World Wide Web, FTP, Telnet, SMTP, and DNS protocols.</t>
