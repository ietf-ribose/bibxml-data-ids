    <abstract>
      <t>The Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN) architecture describes a type of challenged network in which communications may be significantly affected by long signal propagation delays, frequent link disruptions, or both. The unique characteristics of this environment require a unique approach to network management that can support asynchronous transport, autonomous local control, and require a very small footprint so as to deploy on resource constrained devices. This document describes a DTN management architecture (DTNMA) suitable for managing devices in any challenged environment but, in particular, those communicating using the DTN Bundle Protocol (BPv7). Operating using BPv7 require that the architecture not presume any synchronized transport behavior. This means that the DTNMA cannot operate as a query-response system across the network. This allows implementations compliant with the DTNMA to operate in extremely challenging conditions, such as over uni-directional links and other places where BPv7 is the preferred transport.</t>
