      <t>While the device management protocol NETCONF is generally well served by BEEP, there are environments where additional transports are desirable. The binding to SOAP described here may find application where SOAP-based tools and implementations are prevalent or where the network configuration favors HTTP. When used with multiple HTTP connections, SOAP over HTTP is sufficient for all NETCONF features except those involving asynchronous notification.</t>
