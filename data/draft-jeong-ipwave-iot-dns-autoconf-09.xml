    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for device discovery and service discovery in IP-based vehicular networks. Through the device discovery, this document supports the global (or local) DNS naming of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, such as sensors, actuators, and in-vehicle units. By this scheme, the DNS name of an IoT device can be autoconfigured with the device's model information in wired and wireless target networks (e.g., vehicle, road network, home, office, shopping mall, and smart grid). Through the service discovery, IoT users (e.g., drivers, passengers, home residents, and customers) in the Internet (or local network) can easily identify each device for monitoring and remote-controlling it in a target network.</t>
