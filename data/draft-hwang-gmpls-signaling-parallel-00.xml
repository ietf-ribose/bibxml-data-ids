      <t>The Internet transport infrastructure is moving towards a model of high-speed routers interconnected by optical core networks. At the same time, a consensus has emerged in the industry on utilizing IP- based protocols for the optical control plane. GMPLS is assumed to be the most possible control plane for the future all optical transport network.</t>
