      <t>This document discusses ways in which segment routing (aka source routing) paradigm could be leveraged inside the data-center to improve application performance and network reliability. Specifically, it focuses on exposing path visibility to the host's networking stack and leveraging this to address a few well-known performance and reliability problems in data-center networks.</t>
