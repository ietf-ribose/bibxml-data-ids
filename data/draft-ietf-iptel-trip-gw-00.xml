    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a new application of the Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP) protocol. TRIP was engineered as a tool for inter- domain exchange of telephone routing information. However, it can also be used as a means for gateways and soft switches to export their routing information to a Location Server (LS), which may be co-resident with a proxy or gatekeeper. This LS can then manage those gateway resources. We discuss the motivations for this application, and then show how a subset of TRIP is needed for this application.</t>
