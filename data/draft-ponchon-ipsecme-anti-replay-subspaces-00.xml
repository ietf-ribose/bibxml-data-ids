    <abstract>
      <t>This document discusses the challenges of running IPsec with anti- replay in environments where packets may be re-ordered (e.g., when sent over multiple IP paths, traffic-engineered paths and/or using different QoS classes) as well as when processed on multiple cores. Different approaches to solving this problem are discussed, and a new solution based on splitting the anti-replay sequence number space into multiple different sequencing subspaces is proposed. Since this solution requires support on both parties, an IKE extension is proposed in order to negotiate the use of the Anti-Replay sequence number subspaces.</t>
