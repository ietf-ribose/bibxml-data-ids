      <t>This document defines an LDAPv3 control that can select multiple entries in a subtree of a container entry for modification or deletion. This control extends the scope of the LDAPv3 modify and delete operations as defined in [RFC 2251]. This control is useful for modifying or deleting multiple entries on the basis of a single selection criterion. This may be useful for maintenance of an LDAP directory having a large number of objects. Example of Usage - This control can be used by client applications who have the need to modify or delete a large number of entries in an LDAP directory based on a selection criterion. One example of such a usage is when two departments in an organization merge. In this case the 'department' name or number given to a number of employees need to change, and all the employees in a given department are to be assigned the new 'department'. Here the EntrySelection control can be used to select the entries to be modified based on the 'department' value, and the modify operation can change the 'department' value for all the selected entries to the given value.</t>
