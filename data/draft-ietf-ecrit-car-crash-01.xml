    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes how to use IP-based emergency services mechanisms to support the next generation of emergency calls placed by vehicles (automatically in the event of a crash or serious incident, or manually invoked by a vehicle occupant) and conveying vehicle, sensor, and location data related to the crash or incident. Such calls are often referred to as "Automatic Crash Notification" (ACN), or "Advanced Automatic Crash Notification" (AACN), even in the case of manual trigger. The "Advanced" qualifier refers to the ability to carry a richer set of data. This document also registers a MIME Content Type and an Emergency Call Additional Data Block for the vehicle, sensor, and location data (often referred to as "crash data" even though there is not necessarily a crash). An external specification for the data format, contents, and structure are referenced in this document. Profiling and simplifications are possible due to the nature of the functionality that is provided in vehicles with the usage of Global Satellite Navigation System (GNSS). This document does not address pan-European eCall (a mandated and standardized system for emergency calls by in-vehicle systems within Europe and other regions), which is the subject of a separate document, [I-D.ietf-ecrit-ecall].</t>
