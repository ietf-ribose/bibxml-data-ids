      <t>Virtual Aggregation (VA) is a mechanism for shrinking the size of theDFZ FIB in routers [I-D.francis-intra-va]. VA can result in longerpaths and increased load on routers within the ISP that deploys VA.This document describes a mechanism that allows an AS that originatesa route to associate a tunnel endpoint terminating at itself with theroute. This allows routers in a remote AS to tunnel packets to theoriginating AS. If transit ASes between the remote AS and theoriginating AS install the prefixes associated with tunnel endpointsin their FIBs, then tunneled packets that transit through them willtake the shortest path. This results in reduced load for the transitAS, and better performance for the customers at the source anddestination.</t>
