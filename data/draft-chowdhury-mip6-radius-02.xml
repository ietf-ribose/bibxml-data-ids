      <t>A Mobile IPv6 node requires a home agent address, a home address, andan IPsec security association with its home agent before it can startutilizing Mobile IPv6 service. RFC 3775 requires that some or all ofthese parameters are statically configured. Ongoing work aims tomake this information dynamically available to the mobile node. Animportant aspect of the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping solution is tosupport interworking with the existing authentication, authorizationand accounting infrastructure. This document defines new attributesthat facilitate Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping via a RADIUSinfrastructure. This information exchange may take place as part ofthe initial network access authentication procedure or as part of aseparate protocol exchange between the mobile node, the home agentand the AAA infrastructure.</t>
