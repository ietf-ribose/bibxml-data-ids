      <t>This document summarizes a University thesis which aims to measurethe evolution over time of IPv6 traffic, to analyze the geographicaldistribution of IPv6 nodes and to compare the two Internet Protocolversions on many different criteria (RTT, latency, MTU). Themeasurements were done during the Summer 2009 using a specific-purpose program which connects to the BitTorrent peer-to-peernetwork.The study was made in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks because they areresponsible for most Internet traffic and because their structure andfunctioning permit a rapid discovery of a large number of nodes fromall over the world. In addition, the P2P users are more likely to beinterested by IPv6 as IPv6 does not have the same NAT problems asIPv4.</t>
