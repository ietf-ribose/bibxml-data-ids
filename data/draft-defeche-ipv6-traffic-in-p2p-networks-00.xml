      <t>This document summarizes a University thesis which aims to measure the evolution over time of IPv6 traffic, to analyze the geographical distribution of IPv6 nodes and to compare the two Internet Protocol versions on many different criteria (RTT, latency, MTU). The measurements were done during the Summer 2009 using a specific- purpose program which connects to the BitTorrent peer-to-peer network. The study was made in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks because they are responsible for most Internet traffic and because their structure and functioning permit a rapid discovery of a large number of nodes from all over the world. In addition, the P2P users are more likely to be interested by IPv6 as IPv6 does not have the same NAT problems as IPv4.</t>
