      <t>This draft proposes unified L2 abstractions for L3-driven fasthandovers. For efficient network communication, it is vital for aprotocol layer to know or utilize other layer's information such as aform of L2 triggers. However, each protocol layer is basicallydesigned independently. Since each protocol layer is alsoimplemented independently in current operating systems, it is veryhard to exchange control information between protocol layers. Tosolve the problem, this draft defines nine kinds of L2 abstractionsin the form of "primitive" to achieve fast handovers in the networklayer. This mechanism is called "L3-driven fast handovers" becausethe network layer initiates L2 and L3 handovers by using the"primitives".</t>
