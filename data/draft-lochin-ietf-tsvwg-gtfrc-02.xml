      <t>This memo introduces gTFRC, a TCP-Friendly Rate Control providing throughput guarantee over the DiffServ/AF class. gTFRC is largely based on TFRC [2]. It provides a mean to take into account the quality of service negotiated with the network. As a result, the mechanism is able to reach a minimum throughput guarantee whatever the flow's RTT and target rate.</t>
