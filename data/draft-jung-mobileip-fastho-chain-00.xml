      <t>Mobile IP allows a mobile node to send and receive packets regardless of the IP address of its current point of attachment in the Internet. Several handover protocol using Layer 2 information has proposed for fast handover. We propose a modification of the fast handover protocol with simple Layer 2 triggers. For successive handovers of a Mobile Node on real-time service, a chain tunneling handover is proposed. For effective operation of the chain, the chain length threshold is adopted to prevent packet delay due to the successive handovers. Tunnel negotiation is employed to adopt the local resource and security conditions and management policies.</t>
