    <abstract>
      <t>IP packets (both IPv4 and IPv6) contain a single unit of transport layer protocol data which becomes the retransmission unit in case of loss. Transport layer protocols including the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and reliable transport protocol users of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) prepare data units known as "segments", with individual IP packets including only a single segment. This document presents new constructs known as "IP Parcels" and "Advanced Jumbos". IP parcels permit a single packet to carry multiple transport layer protocol segments in a "packet-of-packets", while advanced jumbos provide significant operational advantages over standard jumbograms for carrying truly large singleton segments. IP parcels and advanced jumbos provide essential building blocks for improved performance, efficiency and integrity while encouraging larger Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs) in the Internet.</t>
