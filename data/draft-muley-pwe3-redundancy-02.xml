      <t>This document describes a few scenarios where PW redundancy isneeded. A set of redundant PWs is configured between PE nodes in SS-PW applications, or between T-PE nodes in MS-PW applications. Inorder for the PE/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred PW path toforward to one another, a new status bit is needed to indicate thepreferential forwarding status of active or standby for each PW inthe redundancy set as defined in [7]. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].</t>
