      <t>Computing in the Network (COIN) comes with the prospect of deploying functionality on networking devices, such as switches and network interface cards. While such functionality can be beneficial in several contexts, it has to be carefully placed into the context of the general Internet communication. This document discusses some use cases to demonstrate how real applications can benefit from COIN and to showcase essential requirements that have to be fulfilled by COIN applications.</t>
