      <t>Watchers are defined as entities that request (i.e., subscribe to)presence information about a user. There is fairly complex stateassociated with this subscription, and this state is dynamic. As aresult, it is possible, and indeed useful, to subscribe to thewatcher information for a particular subscriber. In order to enablethis, a format is needed to describe the state of watchers. Thisspecification describes an XML document format for such state.</t>
