      <t>Watchers are defined as entities that request (i.e., subscribe to) presence information about a user. There is fairly complex state associated with this subscription, and this state is dynamic. As a result, it is possible, and indeed useful, to subscribe to the watcher information for a particular subscriber. In order to enable this, a format is needed to describe the state of watchers. This specification describes an XML document format for such state.</t>
