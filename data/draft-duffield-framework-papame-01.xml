      <t>A wide range of traffic engineering and troubleshooting tasks rely onreliable, timely, and detailed traffic measurements. We describe apassive packet measurement framework that is (a) general enough toserve as the basis for a wide range of operational tasks, and (b)relies on a small set of primitives that facilitate uniformdeployment in router interfaces or dedicated measurement devices,even at very high speeds. This document describes the motivation forsuch a framework through several operational examples, defines themeasurement primitives (filtering, sampling, and hashing), andillustrates their use.</t>
