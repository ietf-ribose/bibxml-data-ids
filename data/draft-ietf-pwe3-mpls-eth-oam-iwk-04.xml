      <t>This document specifies the mapping of defect states between Ethernet Attachment Circuits (ACs) and associated Ethernet Pseudowires (PWs) connected in accordance to the PWE3 architecture [RFC3985] to realize an end-to-end emulated Ethernet service. This document augments the mapping of defect states between a PW and associated AC of the end-to-end emulated service in [PW-OAM-MSG- MAP]. In [PW-OAM-MSG-MAP], Ethernet OAM was not covered due to lack of Ethernet OAM maturity. However, since then, [Y.1731] and [802.1ag] have been completed, and this document specifies the mapping of defect states between Ethernet ACs and corresponding Ethernet PWs.</t>
