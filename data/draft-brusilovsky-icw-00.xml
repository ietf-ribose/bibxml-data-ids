      <t>The purpose of this Internet Draft is to start discussion on the issues involved in Internet Call Waiting Service (ICW), as part of interconnecting IP and Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN) with the intent of providing ICW service that is much needed by numerous dial-up Internet users. Interworking of the IP network and GSTN, based on open well-defined protocols, will promote interoperability of both the networks and systems built by different vendors. This Internet Draft is submitted with the goal of becoming an informational RFC. The rest of this document is as follows: Section 2 briefly describes the services offered to the end Subscriber. It is the support of these services that necessitates the proposed internetworking project. Section 3 describes the scope of the proposed project by introducing its overall architecture, identifying the interfaces to be standardized, describing experience with SIP for ICW. Sections 4, 5, and 6 respectively address security considerations, supply references, and provide the authors address, as required by [1]. Section 7 acknowledges individuals providing assistance in the creation of this document. Section 8 is the Appendix, which contains IN Tutorial and Figure A.</t>
