    <abstract>
      <t>This specification introduces a mechanism in PIM-SM [RFC4601] for the Last-Hop-Router (LHR) router to discover the stream information. Once this mechanism is available the complications of the shared tree procedures can be avoided. The document introduces a hard-state, reliable transport for the information about multicast streams active in the network. This specification uses the existing PIM reliability mechanisms defined by PIM Over Reliable Transport [RFC6559]. This is simply a means to transmit reliable PIM messages and does not require the support for Join/Prune messages over PORT as defined in [RFC6559].</t>
