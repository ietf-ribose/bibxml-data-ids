    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes a novel mechanism for Source Address Validation (SAV) message propagation based on Segment Routing policies (SR- policy). Traditional SAV mechanisms often rely on routing tables (RIB) and Policy-Based Routing (PBR), but these methods lack the flexibility and granularity needed for some network environments. By leveraging the flexibility and control capabilities of SR-policy, the proposed mechanism ensures that SAV messages are propagated along well-defined paths, ensuring efficient, secure, and accurate source address validation.</t>
