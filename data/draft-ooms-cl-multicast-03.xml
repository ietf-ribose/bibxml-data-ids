      <t>This draft proposes a new mechanism for multipoint-to-multipoint(mp2mp) communication in IP networks, namely Connectionless Multicast(CLM). Instead of a group address, a list of member addresses isencoded in the data packets.The traditional Host Group Model [DEER] for IP multicast requires aglobally unique address for each session. To support this model,multicast routing protocols create state per group in the routers.Like any connection oriented protocol, it suffers from scalabilityproblems in backbone networks where the number of groups to bemaintained can be huge. CLM does not have this problem, andadditionally has some other advantages. Its limitation lies in thenumber of members per multicast session, not in the number ofsessions. CLM will not replace the traditional multicast model. CLMoffers an alternative for mp2mp communication in the cases thattraditional multicast becomes problematic.The pros and cons of CLM are described and suggestions are made toalleviate the disadvantages. Furthermore different modes ofoperation are described: an end-to-end mode in close conjunction withSIP (Session Initiation Protocol [HAND]), as well as an interworkingmode with PIM-SM and Simple Multicast. Both IPv4 and IPv6 areconsidered.</t>
