      <t>This draft describes the methodology for benchmarking IGP Route Convergence. The applicability of this testing is described in [1] and the new terminology that it introduces is defined in [2]. Service Providers use IGP Convergence time as a key metric of router design and architecture. Customers of Service Providers observe convergence time by packet loss. IGP Route Convergence is a Direct Measure of Quality (DMOQ) when benchmarking the data plane and not the control plane. The test cases in this document are black-box tests that emulate the network events that cause route convergence, as described in [1]. Black-box test design accounts for all of the factors for route convergence time, as provided in [1]. The methodology and terminology is to be used for benchmarking route convergence and can be applied to any link-state IGP such as ISIS [3] and OSPF [4].</t>
