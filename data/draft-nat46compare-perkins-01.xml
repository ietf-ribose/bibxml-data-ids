      <t>IVI, IVI + DHCPv6, 1:N IVI, Bidirectional NAT, and SIPNAT have beenproposed to global Internet access to IPv6-only domains. Thesemethods are not all mutually exclusive, and we propose that IVI(along with its variants) along with SIPNAT may be consideredtogether as a more complete solution for enabling access from today'sIPv4 global Internet into IPv6-only domains. This would likely havethe effect of accelerating the adoption of IPv6, since with suchaccess enablements there would be much reduced incentive for newdeployments to require IPv4 addressability. As part of thediscussion, we also include a comparison of the various techniques sothe relative trade-offs may be more easily understood.</t>
