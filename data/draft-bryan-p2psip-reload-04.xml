      <t>This document defines REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD), apeer-to-peer (P2P) signaling protocol for use on the Internet. A P2Psignaling protocol provides its clients with an abstract storage andmessaging service between a set of cooperating peers that form theoverlay network. RELOAD is designed to support a P2P SessionInitiation Protocol (P2PSIP) network, but can be utilized by otherapplications with similar requirements by defining new usages thatspecify the kinds of data that must be stored for a particularapplication. RELOAD defines a security model based on a certificateenrollment service that provides unique identities. NAT traversal isa fundamental service of the protocol. RELOAD also allows accessfrom "client" nodes which do not need to route traffic or store datafor others.</t>
