      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular, it defines objects for managing remote network monitoring (RMON) devices for use on high speed networks. This document contains a MIB Module that defines these new objects and also contains definitions of some updated objects from the RMON-MIB in RFC 2819 and the RMON2-MIB in RFC 2021.
