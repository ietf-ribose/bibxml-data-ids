      <t>The current MVPN specifications do not define encoding and proceduresfor advertising in a single route binding of multiple multicaststreams of a given MVPN customer to a single provider's tunnel. Thisdocument defines such encoding and procedures. These procedures allowin certain situations to reduce MVPN control plane load (note thoughthat these procedures have no impact on the data plane load). Theprocedures specified in this document assume that BGP is used fortransmission of MVPN customers' routing information within theservice provider(s) infrastructure.</t>
