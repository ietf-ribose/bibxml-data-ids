      <t>The migration to post-quantum cryptography often calls for performing multiple key encapsulations in parallel and then combining their outputs to derive a single shared secret. This document defines the KEM combiner KDF( H(ss1) || H(ss2) ) which is considered to be a dual PRF in practice, even though not provably secure. This mechanism simplifies to KDF( ss1 || ss2 ) when used with a KEM which internally uses a KDF to produce its shared secret. RSA-KEM, ECDH, Edwards curve DH, and CRYSTALS-Kyber are shown to meet this criteria and therefore be safe to use with the simplified KEM combiner.</t>
