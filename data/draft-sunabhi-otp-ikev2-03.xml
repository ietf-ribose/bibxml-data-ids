      <t>IKE is a component of IPsec used for performing mutual authentication and establishing and maintaining security associations (SAs). This document presents the changes in Internet Key Exchange Version 2 for one time password. The proposed method of using OTP in IKEv2 not only enhances the security but also has less number of exchange messages as compared to existing OTP-EAP based method.</t>
