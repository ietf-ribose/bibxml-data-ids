      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a mechanism thatallows a User Agent Client (UAC) to request that a particularprotocol extension has to be used to process the request. The UserAgent Server (UAS) declines the request if it does not support theextension. Recently also means have been defined for the User AgentServer (UAS) to determine which extensions are supported by the UserAgent Client (UAC). Furthermore there are also means for requiring proxy servers to understand certain features.</t>
