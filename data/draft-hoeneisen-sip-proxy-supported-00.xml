      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a mechanism that allows a User Agent Client (UAC) to request that a particular protocol extension has to be used to process the request. The User Agent Server (UAS) declines the request if it does not support the extension. Recently also means have been defined for the User Agent Server (UAS) to determine which extensions are supported by the User Agent Client (UAC). Furthermore there are also means for requiring proxy servers to understand certain features.</t>
