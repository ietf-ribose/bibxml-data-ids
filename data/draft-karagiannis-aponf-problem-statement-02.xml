    <abstract>
      <t>As more and more modern network management applications grow in scale and complexity, their demands and requirements on the supporting communication network will increase. In particular, today network operators are challenged to create an abstract view of their network infrastructure and help service developers on using and programming this abstraction rather than manipulating individual devices. In this context, network management applications can be used to provide the required configuration and application programming interfaces to such service developers. The main goal of APONF is to (1) communicate the up to date abstract view of the network between the network management application systems and network management and controlling systems and (2) map the abstract view of the network into specific network management policies, i.e., device level configuration models.</t>
