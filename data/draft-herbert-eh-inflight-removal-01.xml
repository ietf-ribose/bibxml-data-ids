    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies an experimental method to allow routers to remove IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options Headers or Routing Headers from packets in flight. The goal is to reduce the probability of packets being dropped, because they contain these extension headers, without impacting functionality. An additional benefit is to limit visibility of information in extension headers to those nodes that need to process the headers.</t>
