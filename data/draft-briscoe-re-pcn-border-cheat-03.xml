      <t>Scaling per flow admission control to the Internet is a hard problem.The approach of combining Diffserv and pre-congestion notification(PCN) provides a service slightly better than Intserv controlled loadthat scales to networks of any size without needing Diffserv's usualoverprovisioning, but only if domains trust each other to comply withadmission control and rate policing. This memo claims to solve thistrust problem without losing scalability. It provides a sufficientemulation of per-flow policing at borders but with only passive bulkmetering rather than per-flow processing. Measurements aresufficient to apply penalties against cheating neighbour networks.</t>
