    <abstract>
      <t>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices. NETCONF can be carried over various transports such as TCP, SSH or else. QUIC provides useful semantics for Network management and NETCONF in particular as a single connection can carry multiple requests over streams, enabling much better efficiency and performance for both peers. QUIC provides shorter handshake and includes TLS. QUIC is also more adaptable to more difficult environments such as those with long delays. This document describes how to use NETCONF over the QUIC transport protocol, named NETCONFoQUIC.</t>
