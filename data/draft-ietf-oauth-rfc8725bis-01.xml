    <abstract>
      <t>JSON Web Tokens, also known as JWTs, are URL-safe JSON-based security tokens that contain a set of claims that can be signed and/or encrypted. JWTs are being widely used and deployed as a simple security token format in numerous protocols and applications, both in the area of digital identity and in other application areas. This Best Current Practices (BCP) specification updates RFC 7519 to provide actionable guidance leading to secure implementation and deployment of JWTs. This BCP specification furthermore replaces the existing JWT BCP specification RFC 8725 to provide additional actionable guidance covering threats and attacks that have been discovered since RFC 8725 was published.</t>
