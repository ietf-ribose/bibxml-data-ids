      <t>The O/TWAMP security mechanism requires that endpoints (i.e. both the client and the server) possess a shared secret. Since the currently- standardized O/TWAMP security mechanism only supports a pre-shared key mode, large scale deployment of O/TWAMP is hindered significantly. At the same time, recent trends point to wider IKEv2 deployment, which in turn calls for mechanisms and methods that enable tunnel end-users, as well as operators, to measure one-way and two-way network performance in a standardized manner. This document discusses the use of keys derived from an IKE SA as the shared key in O/TWAMP. If the shared key can be derived from the IKE SA, O/TWAMP can support cert-based key exchange, which would allow for more flexibility and efficiency. Such key derivation can also facilitate automatic key management.</t>
