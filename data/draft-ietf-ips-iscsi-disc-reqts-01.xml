      <t>This document describes the iSCSI [7] naming and discovery requirements. The requirements presented in this document have been agreed to by the members of the iSCSI naming and discovery team. This document complements the iSCSI IETF draft. Flexibility is the key guiding principle behind this requirements document. That is, an effort has been made to satisfy the needs of both small isolated environments, as well as large environments requiring secure/scalable solutions.</t>
