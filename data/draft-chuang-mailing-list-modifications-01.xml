      <t>Mailing-lists distribute email to multiple recipients by forwarding and potentially modifying messages to document the distribution to the recipients. Unfortunately forwarding breaks SPF (RFC7208) authentication and message modification breaks DKIM (RFC6376) authentication. This document is based on ARC (RFC8617) to provide a framework to describe forwarding with extensions to tolerate common mailing-list message modifications. This specification characterizes the mailing-list transforms such that a receiver can reverse them to enable digital signatures verification and attribution of the message content. These message modifications are: 1) adding a description string to the Subject header, 2) rewriting the From header, 3) removing the original DKIM-Signature and 4) appending a footer to the message body. This also specifies those modifications for the purpose of making them reversible.</t>
