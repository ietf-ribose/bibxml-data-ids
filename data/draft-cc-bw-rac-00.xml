      <t>Dynamic bandwidth management using ATM Resource Adjuster Cells provides the capability to support fast effective end-to-end bandwidth control for IP traffic transported over an ATM backbone network. This feature can open up potential new services for Service Providers to offer dynamic service levels traffic agreements to their customers. By offering dynamic service levels, Service Providers can broaden their scope of service differentiation. For example, using dynamic bandwidth feature, Service Providers can offer their customers real-time video or multimedia transport capability across the networks. Using Dynamic Resource Adjuster Cells (DRACs), the network supporting it can quickly adjust bandwidth without taking down the ATM network connection and re-establishing it. In a fast changing dynamic environment, this dynamic adjuster capability makes a difference in both performance and scalability.</t>
