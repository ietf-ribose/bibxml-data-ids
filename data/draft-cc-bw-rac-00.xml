      <t>Dynamic bandwidth management using ATM Resource Adjuster Cells providesthe capability to support fast effective end-to-end bandwidth controlfor IP traffic transported over an ATM backbone network. This featurecan open up potential new services for Service Providers to offerdynamic service levels traffic agreements to their customers. Byoffering dynamic service levels, Service Providers can broaden theirscope of service differentiation. For example, using dynamic bandwidthfeature, Service Providers can offer their customers real-time video or multimedia transport capability across the networks. Using Dynamic Resource Adjuster Cells (DRACs), the network supporting itcan quickly adjust bandwidth without taking down the ATM networkconnection and re-establishing it. In a fast changing dynamicenvironment, this dynamic adjuster capability makes a difference inboth performance and scalability.</t>
