      <t>This document outlines a method that may be used by authors of successor (or canceling) articles to authenticate their authorship of the original article. As a proto-article article passes through various agents they may include the hash of a secret string in a Cancel-Key header. Later if they wish to use a standard mechanism to remove the original article (eg Cancel or Supersede) they can include this string in the Cancel-Lock header to verify that they are entitled to perform this operation. Familiarity with the current News Article Format draft [ARTICLE] is assumed.</t>
