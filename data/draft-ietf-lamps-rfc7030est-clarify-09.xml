    <abstract>
      <t>This document updates RFC7030: Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) to resolve some errata that were reported, and which has proven to cause interoperability issues when RFC7030 was extended. This document deprecates the specification of "Content-Transfer- Encoding" headers for EST endpoints. This document fixes some syntactical errors in ASN.1 that were presented.</t>
