      <t>The cycle-based queuing and forwarding is an effective method to ensure that the transmission has a definite upper bound of jitter, as well as latency. The prerequisite for this method is to ensure that queuing resources do not conflict. In large-scale deterministic networks (LDNs), how to avoid the queuing resources conflict of this method is an open problem. This document presents a scheme of planning virtue periodic forwarding channel (VPFC) based on virtual periodic forwarding path (VPFP) in LDNs. The scheme can solve the queuing resources conflict of cycle-specified queuing and forwarding in nonlinear topology domain, thus ensuring the bounded latency of DetNet flow in the same periodic forwarding domain.</t>
