      <t>This document defines a YANG 1.1 data model for configuring global sets of X.509 certificates and SSH host-keys that can be referenced by other data models for trust. While the SSH host-keys are uniquely for the SSH protocol, the X.509 certificates may have multiple uses, including authenticating protocol peers and verifying signatures.
