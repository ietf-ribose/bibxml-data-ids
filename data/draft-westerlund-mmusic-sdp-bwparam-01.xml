      <t>The existing Session Description Protocol (SDP) bandwidth modifiers and their values include the bandwidth needed also for the transport and IP layers. When using SDP in protocols like SAP, SIP and RTSP and the involved hosts reside in networks running different IP versions, the interpretation of what type of lower layers that is included is not clear. This documents defines a bandwidth modifier that does not include transport overhead, instead additional packet rate attributes are defined. The transport independent bitrate value together with the packet rate can then be used to calculate the real bitrate over the actually used transport.</t>
