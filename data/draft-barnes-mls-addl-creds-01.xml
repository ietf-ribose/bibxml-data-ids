    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines two new kinds of credentials for use within the Message Layer Security (MLS) credential framework: UserInfo Verifiable Credentials and multi-credentials. UserInfo Verifiable Credentials allow clients to present credentials that associate OpenID Connect attributes to a signature key pair held by the client. Multi-credentials allow clients to present authenticated attributes from multiple sources, or to present credentials in different formats to support groups with heterogeneous credential support.</t>
