      <t>"BGP Routes with Color" have become a topic of interest in the IDR Working Group. The authors of the various proposals have many things in mind to solve with them, how a color might be used, and the operational model for their solution. In general, the solutions share some core properties: Routes for an IP endpoint, that have a domain-wide semantic element to differentiate forwarding (often called a color), and appropriate state to enable that differentiated forwarding. Examples of the technologies enabling differentiated forwarding include MPLS and Segment Routing. This document examines two of the current proposals - BGP Color-Aware Routing, and BGP Classful Transport - and proposes mechanisms to permit them to interoperate.</t>
