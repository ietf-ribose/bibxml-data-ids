      <t>In general, certificates need not be communicated with communication orstorage media that are integrity-secure or authentic. This is becausecertificates are digitally signed and users are expected to validate thesignatures using configured trust anchors. However, distribution oftrust anchor certificates, self-signed end-entity certificates, or bare(unsigned) public keys requires a mechanism for establishing theauthenticity of the certificate or public key.</t>
