      <t>This memo describes an option to the OSPF Version 2 specificationwhich allows the partial suppression of flooding between neighboringrouters. This suppression acts much like a floodgate, opening andclosing automatically when triggered by the proper conditions. Twotypes of flooding suppression are described, 1-Way and 2-Way. Theoption applies to standard areas, stub areas, and NSSAs. It worksover any OSPF interface. Routers with this option configured arebackward compatible with routers running an OSPFv2 compliantimplementation as defined in RFC 2328, and can be restricted to asubset of the OSPF routing domain. This option is applied onlybetween neighboring OSPF routers.</t>
