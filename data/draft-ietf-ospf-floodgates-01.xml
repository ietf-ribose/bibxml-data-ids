      <t>This memo describes an option to the OSPF Version 2 specification which allows the partial suppression of flooding between neighboring routers. This suppression acts much like a floodgate, opening and closing automatically when triggered by the proper conditions. Two types of flooding suppression are described, 1-Way and 2-Way. The option applies to standard areas, stub areas, and NSSAs. It works over any OSPF interface. Routers with this option configured are backward compatible with routers running an OSPFv2 compliant implementation as defined in RFC 2328, and can be restricted to a subset of the OSPF routing domain. This option is applied only between neighboring OSPF routers.</t>
