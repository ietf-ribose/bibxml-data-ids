      <t>This document describes a set of best practices for facilitating interactions between automated software agents (AI agents) using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). As agentic systems proliferate, they frequently utilize HTTP in ad-hoc ways, leading to interoperability challenges and the rise of proprietary, "walled garden" ecosystems. This document proposes a minimalist, standardized framework based on existing HTTP semantics to promote a more cohesive, efficient, and open ecosystem. The primary recommendations codify the principles of the Agentic Hypercall Protocol (AHP), including tool invocation via GET requests, a stateless authentication scheme, and the formalization of the 402 (Payment Required) status code to enable a native economic layer for the machine economy.</t>
