      <t>A Generic Associated Channel (G-ACH) has been defined as an extensionof the pseudowire Associated Channel Header (ACH) to enable therealization of a control/communication channel associated withMultiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs),MPLS pseudowires (PWs), MPLS LSP segments, and MPLS sections betweenadjacent MPLS-capable devices.The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of the MPLSarchitecture that identifies elements of the MPLS toolkit that may becombined to build a carrier grade packet transport network based onMPLS packet switching technology.This document describes how the G-ACH may be used to provide theinfrastructure that forms part of the Management CommunicationNetwork (MCN) and a Signaling Communication Network (SCN).Collectively, the MCN and SCN may be referred to as the DataCommunication Network (DCN). The document explains how MCN and SCNpackets are encapsulated, carried on the G-ACH, and demultiplexed for</t>
