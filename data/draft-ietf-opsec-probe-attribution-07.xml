      <t>Active measurements over the public Internet can target either collaborating parties or non-collaborating ones. Sometimes these measurements, also called probes, are viewed as unwelcome or aggressive. This document suggests some simple techniques for a source to identify its probes, allowing any party or organization to understand what an unsolicited probe packet is, what its purpose is, and more importantly who to contact. The technique relies on off-line analysis of the probe, therefore it does not require any change in the data or control plane. It has been designed mainly for layer-3 measurements.</t>
