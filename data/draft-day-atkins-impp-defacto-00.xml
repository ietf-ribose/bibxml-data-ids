      <t>This is a 'de facto IMPP charter' to accompany the IMPP submissions tothe IESG. Such an arrangement is not ordinarily part of the IETFprocess, but appears to be the most effective means of providingnecessary context to the IESG as it considers the IMPP documents. Thefirst part of this document describes the circumstances that have ledto this unusual de facto charter. The second part describes the IMPPcharter as it has been understood by the current chairs.</t>
