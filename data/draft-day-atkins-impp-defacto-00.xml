      <t>This is a 'de facto IMPP charter' to accompany the IMPP submissions to the IESG. Such an arrangement is not ordinarily part of the IETF process, but appears to be the most effective means of providing necessary context to the IESG as it considers the IMPP documents. The first part of this document describes the circumstances that have led to this unusual de facto charter. The second part describes the IMPP charter as it has been understood by the current chairs.</t>
