      <t>This document describes an approach for solving the 'last-mile' problem for multicast, especially SSM-style multicast, called Multicast Signaling Conduit Protocol (MSCP). It is intended to facilitate an endnode whose OS does not support IGMPv3, or who resides in a portion of the Internet infrastructure without multicast, to join multicast groups. It is especially intended for SSM-style groups, although it could be adapted for use for other multicast groups.</t>
