      <t>In order to transmit IPv6 packets on IEEE 802.11p networks there is a need to define a few parameters such as the recommended Maximum Transmission Unit size, the header format preceding the IPv6 base header, the Type value within it, and others. This document describes these parameters for IPv6 and IEEE 802.11p networks; it portrays the layering of IPv6 on 802.11p similarly to other known 802.11 and Ethernet layers, by using an existing Ethernet Adaptation Layer. In addition, the document attempts to list what is different in 802.11p compared to more 'traditional' 802.11a/b/g/n layers, layers over which IPv6 protocols run ok. Most notably, the operation outside the context of a BSS (OCB) has impact on IPv6 handover behaviour and on IPv6 security. An example of an IPv6 packet captured while transmitted over an IEEE 802.11p link is given.</t>
