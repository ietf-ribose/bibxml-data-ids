      <t>This draft introduces Multicast Control Protocol (MCOP) that may beused as a tool for multicast network management. MCOP providesmulticast network remote management with centralized informationdatabase located at Multicast Control Server (MCS). It allowsgradual, group and network specific multicast network deployment.MCOP protocol is used between MCS and routers that have directlyconnected multicast sources or receivers. The actual control is doneby MCOP enabled routers based on the information received from theMCS. MCOP router can filter IGMP/MLD reports and multicast packetsbefore they reach the IGMP/MLD processing layer or multicast routingstack of the router. MCOP is independent of multicast routingprotocols.</t>
