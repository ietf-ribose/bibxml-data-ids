      <t>This draft introduces Multicast Control Protocol (MCOP) that may be used as a tool for multicast network management. MCOP provides multicast network remote management with centralized information database located at Multicast Control Server (MCS). It allows gradual, group and network specific multicast network deployment. MCOP protocol is used between MCS and routers that have directly connected multicast sources or receivers. The actual control is done by MCOP enabled routers based on the information received from the MCS. MCOP router can filter IGMP/MLD reports and multicast packets before they reach the IGMP/MLD processing layer or multicast routing stack of the router. MCOP is independent of multicast routing protocols.</t>
