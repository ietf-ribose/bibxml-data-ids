      <t>TCP Cookie Transactions (TCPCT) [RFC6013] deter spoofing of |connections and prevent resource exhaustion, eliminating Responder(server) state during the initial handshake. The Initiator (client)has sole responsibility for ensuring required delays betweenconnections. The cookie exchange may carry data, limited to inhibitamplification and reflection denial of service attacks.This document provides a sockets Application Program Interface (API)to support "basic" and "advanced" TCPCT applications. TCP/IPapplications written using the sockets API have enjoyed a high degreeof portability.Copyright NoticeCopyright (c) 2011 IETF Trust and the persons identified as thedocument authors.
