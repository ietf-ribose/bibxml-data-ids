      <t>Historically, the meaning of an IP address has been to identify an interface on a network device. Routing protocols were developed based on the assumption that a destination address had this semantic. Over time, routing decisions were enhanced to route packets according to additional information carried within the packets and dependent on policy coded in, configured at, or signaled to the routers. Many proposals have been made to add semantics to IP packets by placing additional information existing fields, by adding semantics to IP addresses, or by adding fields to the packets. The intent is to facilitate enhanced routing decisions based on these additional semantics in order to provide differentiated paths for different packet flows distinct from simple shortest path first routing. We call this approach "Semantic Routing". This document describes the challenges to the existing routing system that are introduced by Semantic Routing. It then summarizes the opportunities for research into new or modified routing protocols to make use of new or additional semantics. This document is presented as study to support further research into clarifying and understanding the issues. It does not pass comment on the advisability or practicality of any of the proposals and does not define any technical solutions.</t>
