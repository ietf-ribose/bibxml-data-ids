      <t>This draft introduces a different mode for the mobility usage in IP networks. This mode does not modify the Mobile IP protocol specifications [2], but makes their use more efficient according to the movements of the mobile node as far as its communications are concerned. The Mobile IP mechanisms will be used only for the ongoing communications while the mobile node is in motion. That is, the Mobile IP mechanisms will be used for the communications established from an IP sub-network and which continue whenever the mobile node moves to another IP sub-network. For all the communications that are opened and closed in the same IP sub-network there is no need to use Mobile IP mechanisms even if the mobile node is away from its home network.</t>
