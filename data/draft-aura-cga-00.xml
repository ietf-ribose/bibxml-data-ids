      <t>Cryptographically generated addresses (CGA) are IPv6 addresses where the interface identifier is generated by hashing the address owner's public key. The address owner can then use the corresponding private key to assert address ownership and to sign messages sent from the address without any additional security infrastructure. This document describes a generic CGA format that can be used in multiple applications.</t>
