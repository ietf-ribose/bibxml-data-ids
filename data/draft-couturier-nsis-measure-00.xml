      <t>This document defines SQM (Signaling for QoS Measurement), an architecture for QoS measurements of IP flows along their paths. The goal of this architecture is to configure on demand several probes, and to collect and coordinate the results in a multi domain environment, in order to determine in real time the QoS experienced by a flow on several nodes of its path. A new signaling is used to install metering and reporting states in network nodes. A coordination of works related to NSIS, PSAMP and IPFIX could achieve the SQM specification.</t>
