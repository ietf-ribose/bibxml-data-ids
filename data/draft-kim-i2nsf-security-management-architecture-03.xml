      <t>This document describes an architecture for security management in Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) framework. This security management architecture consists of I2NSF User, Security Management System (i.e., Security Controller and Developer's Management System), and Network Security Functions (NSFs) in the I2NSF framework. I2NSF User consists of Application Logic, Policy Updater, and Event Collector. Security Controller consists of Security Policy Manager and NSF Capability Manager. This document explains their missions and the processing of security management in a high level. It also describes representative use cases, such as security management for the list of malware domains, security management for VoIP-VoLTE and time-dependent access control.</t>
