    <abstract>
      <t>In order to decrease handoff latency, the concept of pre-emptive provisioning is under investigation. This document describes an experimental extension that enables an accounting server to notify a NAS of a prospective handoff. This enables the NAS to reserve resources and obtain the session parameters prior to arrival of the client, potentially reducing handoff times. The extension described in this document may potentially be useful in enabling handoffs across access technologies and providers. However, whether the approach described in this document is effective, deployable or secure is the subject of current research. It is offered for RADIUS primarily because source code for RADIUS client and server implementations is readily available for research purposes. Given that this extension represents research work in progress, implementation of this specification for purposes other than research is not recommended.</t>
