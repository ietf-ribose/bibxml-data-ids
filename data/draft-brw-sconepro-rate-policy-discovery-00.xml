    <abstract>
      <t>Traffic exchanged over an attachment circuit may be subject to rate- limit policies. These policies may be intentional policies (e.g., enforced as part of the activation of the attachment circuit and typically agreed upon service subscription) or be reactive policies (e.g., enforced temporarily to manage an overload or during a DDoS attack mitigation). Networks already support mechanisms to advertize a set of network properties to hosts using Neighbor Discovery options. Examples of such properties are link MTU (RFC 4861) and PREFIX64 (RFC 8781). This document complements these tools and specifies a Neighbor Discovery option to be used in Router Advertisements (RAs) to communicate these policies to hosts. For address family parity, a new DHCP option is also defined.</t>
