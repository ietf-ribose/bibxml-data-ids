      <t>As requested in the Beijing meeting, this is an individual draft that expands on the usage tier/volume use case from [McDysan]. The feedback recorded in the Beijing conex meeting minutes was that a number of people were potentially interested in this use case, but that it was out of scope of the current charter, and/or could potentially be built out of the conex abstract mechanism.</t>
