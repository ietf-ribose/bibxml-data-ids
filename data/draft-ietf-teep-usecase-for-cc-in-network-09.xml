    <abstract>
      <t>Confidential computing is the protection of data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment. Confidential computing could provide integrity and confidentiality for users who want to run applications and process data in that environment. When confidential computing is used in scenarios which need network to provision user data and applications, TEEP architecture and protocol could be used. This usecase illustrates the steps of how to deploy applications, containers, VMs and data in different confidential computing hardware in network. This document is a use case and extension of TEEP architecture and could provide guidance for cloud computing, MEC (Multi-access Computing) and other scenarios to use confidential computing in network.</t>
