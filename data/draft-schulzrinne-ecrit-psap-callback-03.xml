      <t>After an emergency call is completed (either prematurely terminatedby the emergency caller or normally by the call-taker) it is possiblethat the call-taker feels the need for further communication or for aclarification. For example, the call may have been dropped byaccident without the call-taker having sufficient information aboutthe current situation of a wounded person. A call-taker may triggera callback towards the emergency caller using the contact informationprovided with the initial emergency call. This callback could, undercertain circumstances, then be treated like any other call and as aconsequence, it may get blocked by authorization policies or may getforwarded to an answering machine.The IETF emergency services architecture addresses callbacks in alimited fashion and thereby covers a couple of scenarios. Thisdocument discusses some shortcomings and raises the question whetheradditional solution techniques are needed.</t>
