      <t>When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to reduce sending traffic for some period of time. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for transporting overload and load information. While these proposals differ in many ways, they share similar data requirements. This document analyzes the data requirements of each proposal with a view towards proposing a common set of of Diameter Attribute-Value Pairs (AVPs).</t>
