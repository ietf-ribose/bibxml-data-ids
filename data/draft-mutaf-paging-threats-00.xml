      <t>This document is an analysis of threats that arise from using link layer paging technologies or IP paging in the Internet where denial-of-service attacks are common and easy. These problems fall in the scope of IP paging, since link layer paging technologies do not have provisions for repelling such threats and the source of an attack may be anywhere in the Internet. In addition, vulnerabilities that may be added by IP paging are also discussed.</t>
