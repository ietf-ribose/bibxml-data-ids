      <t>While there are several established protocols for end-to-end encryption, relatively little attention has been given to securely distributing the end-user public keys for such encryption. As a result, these protocols are often still vulnerable to eavesdropping by active attackers. Key Transparency is a protocol for distributing sensitive cryptographic information, such as public keys, in a way that reliably either prevents interference or detects that it occurred in a timely manner.</t>
