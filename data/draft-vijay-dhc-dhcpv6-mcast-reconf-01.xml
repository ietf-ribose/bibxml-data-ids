      <t>Stateless DHCPv6 [DHCPv6Light] is a light-weight DHCPv6 [DHCPv6]protocol in which the server manages only the service parameters likeDNS server addresses, NTP server addresses etc., and hence there isno need to maintain the state of the clients, perhaps, it doesn'tneed to store any information about the clients at all. So, arenumbering event or change in some of the configuration parameterscannot be notified to the clients by the stateless DHCPv6 server.This specification provides a solution for this.</t>
