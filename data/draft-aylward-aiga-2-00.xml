      <t>This document specifies the AI Governance and Accountability (AIGA) Protocol, a practical, economically viable, and technically enforceable framework for governing autonomous AI agents. AIGA is designed to address real-world deployment constraints, adversarial agent scenarios, and economic incentive alignment. The protocol is founded on a Tiered Risk-Based Governance model, applying proportional oversight to agents based on their capabilities. All agents are governed by an Immutable Kernel Architecture which provides a non-modifiable Trusted Computing Base (TCB) for enforcing policy. This is combined with Action-Based Authorization, where critical operations require real-time approval. To solve the single-point-of-failure problem, the protocol uses a Federated Authority Network of regional, cross-validating hubs and provides a Network-Level Quarantine Protocol for enforcement. The entire framework is designed around Economic Incentive Alignment, making compliance the most economically rational choice for operators. For high-assurance (T3-T4) scenarios, AIGA specifies advanced, redundant mechanisms including Multi-Vendor TEE Attestation (M-TACE), AI "Warden Triumvirate" Triage, Human Review Board (HRB) Multi- Signature, Peer Consensus Failsafe &amp; Identity Rotation, and Double Ratchet Cryptography.</t>
