    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines Multicast Virtual Private Network (VPN) extensions and procedures that allow fast failover for upstream failures by allowing upstream Provider Edges (PEs) to determine a single forwarder for a VPN multicast flow, without the downstream PEs' duplication prevention. The fast failover is accomplished by using Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) [RFC5798] or similar technologies for the upstream PEs to determine a single desinated fowarder. Also, this document introduces a new BGP Extended Community called "Upstream Forwarder Selection", carried by BGP VPN route so that the upstream PEs can inform downstream PEs the election behavior. The downstream PEs, accordingly, send C-multicast routes to both the primary and standby upstream PEs and forward the multicast flow comming from both sides to the CEs.</t>
