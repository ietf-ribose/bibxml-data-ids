      <t>This document presents a survey of some of the most popular Peer-to- Peer (P2P) streaming applications on the Internet. Main selection criteria were popularity and availability of information on operation details at writing time. In doing this, selected applications will not be reviewed as a whole, but we will focus exclusively on the signaling and control protocol used to establish and maintain overlay connections among peers and to advertise and download streaming content.</t>
