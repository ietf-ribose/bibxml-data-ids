      <t>This document is a summary of the results of meetings with actual manufacturers of industrial products, companies that establish and run social infrastructures (hereafter referred to as "Things companies"), and ICT enterprises about the challenges they face in realizing IoT. These meetings revealed that the Things companies are troubled by such as the vast gap between the product lifetimes of their company products and the pace at which generation changes occur in ICT technologies, the difference between the actual values and catalog values of the wave traveling ranges, and the enormous number of sensors that need to be installed. In order to deploy about IoT, we believe that the solutions to these primitive issues must be promoted in tandem with a service-oriented approach that places an emphasis on the effects.</t>
