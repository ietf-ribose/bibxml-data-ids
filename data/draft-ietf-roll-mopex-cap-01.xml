      <t>RPL allows different mode of operations which allows nodes to have a consensus on the basic primitives that must be supported to join the network. The MOP field in RFC6550 is of 3 bits and is fast depleting. This document extends the MOP field specification and adds a notion of capabilities using which the nodes can further advertise their support for, possibly optional, capabilities.</t>
