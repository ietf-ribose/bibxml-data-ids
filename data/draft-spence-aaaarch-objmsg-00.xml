      <t>This memo specifies the top level data objects to be carried in anAAA Protocol that supports the generic AAA architecture described inRFC 2903. It also specifies the required message types. Dataobjects and message types are defined in an abstract way withoutregard to encoding. The message types defined could be thought of asthe use cases (in the UML sense) for a generic AAA server. Theydefine what can be asked of or provided to a generic AAA server. Thedata objects specify what kinds of information can be routed amongthe AAA servers in the generic AAA infrastructure. Suggestions as towhich data objects would be carried in each message type areprovided.</t>
