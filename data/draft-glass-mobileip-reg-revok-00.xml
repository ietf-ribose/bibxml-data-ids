      <t>During the original design of Mobile IP, the potential need for an administrative domain to be able to actively revoke a current Mobile IP registration was recognized. Due to the lack of a specific scenario requiring such a mechanism, it was decided that a passive mechanism, namely short registration lifetimes, and the denial of a subsequent registration from a MN, would be sufficient for this purpose.</t>
