      <t>During the original design of Mobile IP, the potential need for anadministrative domain to be able to actively revoke a current MobileIP registration was recognized. Due to the lack of a specificscenario requiring such a mechanism, it was decided that a passivemechanism, namely short registration lifetimes, and the denial of asubsequent registration from a MN, would be sufficient for thispurpose.</t>
