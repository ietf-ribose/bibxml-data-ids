    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the framework for Distributed Conferencing (DCON). The framework draws inspiration from the work carried out in the XCON working group, which has defined a complete architecture for centralized conferencing. DCON is based on the idea that a distributed conference can be setup by appropriately orchestrating the operation of a number of XCON focus elements, each in charge of managing a certain number of participants. Interaction between each participant and the corresponding conference focus is based on the standard XCON framework, whereas inter-focus interaction is defined in this document.</t>
