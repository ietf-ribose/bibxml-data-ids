    <abstract>
      <t>The Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) signaling is described in RFC 4762. That document describes a mechanism called MAC Address Withdrawal to remove or unlearn MAC addresses which have been dynamically learned in a VPLS instance. Further work in progress defines an extension to MAC Address Withdrawal procedure which can greatly restrict the scope of MAC flushing. This document provides a flushing-free mechanism which removes the need for MAC address flushing in a VPLS instance. This mechanism is called MAC Address Switching.</t>
