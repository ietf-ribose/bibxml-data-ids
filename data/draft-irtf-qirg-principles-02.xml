    <abstract>
      <t>The vision of a quantum internet is to fundamentally enhance Internet technology by enabling quantum communication between any two points on Earth. To achieve this goal, a quantum network stack should be built from the ground up as the physical nature of the communication is fundamentally different. The first realisations of quantum networks are imminent, but there is no practical proposal for how to organise, utilise, and manage such networks. In this memo, we attempt lay down the framework and introduce some basic architectural principles for a quantum internet. This is intended for general guidance and general interest, but also to provide a foundation for discussion between physicists and network specialists.</t>
