      <t>This document is a proposal to the IETF/IAB and ISO/ITU to permit the current address administration and registration facilities of the ISO/ITU to assist in deploying some of the IP6 and Internet address forms. It is desired that the next generation Internet architecture and IP6 can be deployed uniformly with other internetworking standards across the world. It has also been desirable that in the process of developing IPng that harmonisation of the OSI and IP internetworking technologies and their addressing schemes occur.</t>
