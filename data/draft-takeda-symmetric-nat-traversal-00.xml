      <t>It is generally known that the binding acquisition for symmetric NATswith STUN (Simple Traversal of UDP through NATs) protocol will notyield a usable address for traversing symmetric NAT. The use ofsymmetric RTP allows you to accompolish symmetric NAT traversal onlyin situations where the other end is open to the Internet, or has afull-cone or a restricted-cone NAT. This document proposes ananalytical method for symmetric NATs to obtain more detailedcharacteristics of the symmetric NAT using STUN, and describes how wecan establish a peer-to-peer UDP connection even in situations whereNATs (including symmetric NATs) are present at both ends.</t>
