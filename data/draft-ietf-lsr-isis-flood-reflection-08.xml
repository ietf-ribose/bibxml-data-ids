    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a backwards compatible, optional IS-IS extension that allows the creation of IS-IS flood reflection topologies. Flood reflection permits topologies in which L1 areas provide transit forwarding for L2 using all available L1 nodes internally. It accomplishes this by creating L2 flood reflection adjacencies within each L1 area. Those adjacencies are used to flood L2 LSPDUs and are used in the L2 SPF computation. However, they are not utilized for forwarding within the flood reflection cluster except in pathological cases mentioned in Section 7. This arrangement gives the L2 topology significantly better scaling properties than traditionally used flat designs. As an additional benefit, only those routers directly participating in flood reflection are required to support the feature. This allows for incremental deployment of scalable L1 transit areas in an existing, previously flat network design, without the necessity of upgrading all routers in the network.</t>
