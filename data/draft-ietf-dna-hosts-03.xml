      <t>Hosts experiencing rapid link-layer changes may require efficient IPconfiguration change detection procedures than traditional fixedhosts. DNA is defined as the process by which a host collectsappropriate information and detects the identity of its currentlyattached link to ascertain the validity of its IP configuration.This document details best current practice for Detecting NetworkAttachment in IPv6 hosts using existing Neighbor Discoveryprocedures. Since there is no explicit link identification mechanismin the existing Neighbor Discovery for IP Version 6, the documentdescribes implicit mechanisms for identifying the current link.</t>
