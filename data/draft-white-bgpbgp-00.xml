      <t>A wide array of information is being carried (or proposed to be carried) through BGP peering sessions. While this information is necessary and valid, BGP was not designed to carry blobs of information, but rather network layer reachability and information related directly to forwarding traffic from peer to peer. This document proposes a new BGP message type with a well defined structure to use BGP peering sessions for information passed from provider to provider along edge peering points, the BGP based Generic transPort (bgpBGP). This message type is designed to allow any pair of BGP speakers to transfer information within an existing session, or for BGP peering semantics to be used with multihop sessions between "information exchange speakers" within an autonomous system. The new message type is designed to provide flexibility by allowing the encoding of virtually any information within a BGP session through the use of type-length-vector formatting.</t>
