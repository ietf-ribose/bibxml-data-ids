    <abstract>
      <t>Several algorithms have been proposed to deal with the group key management problem. The most promising are those based on Logical Key Hierarchies (LKH). An LKH reduces the size of the rekey messages, reducing also the storage and processing requirements. An improved LKH algorithm called LKH+2 is described here. Using LKH+2, a group manager can use keys already in the tree to derive new keys. Using previously known keys saves information to be transmitted to members when a membership change occurs and new keys have to be created or updated. LKH+2 achieves K log_2 n message size (K is the size of a key) for leave operations. It is alsoshown that the LKH+2 algorithm does not increase the storage andprocessing requirements when compared to other LKH schemes.</t>
