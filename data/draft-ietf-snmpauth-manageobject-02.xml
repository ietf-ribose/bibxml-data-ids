      <t>This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular, it describes a representation of the authentication communities defined in the companion memo: Authentication and Privacy in the SNMP as objects in the Internet Standard MIB. These definitions are consistent with the administrative strategies set forth in the companion memo: Administration of SNMP Communities.</t>
