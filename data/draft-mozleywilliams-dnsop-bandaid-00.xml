    <abstract>
      <t>The emerging field of agent-to-agent protocol standards introduces new requirements in order to facilitate discovery, trust signaling, session negotiation and communication. This document specifies a method for utilizing the Domain Name System (DNS) to facilitate scalable and interoperable discovery between AI agents. The proposed mechanism, referred to as _Brokered Agent Network for DNS AI Discovery_ (BANDAID), defines a structured DNS namespace and record usage model to support metadata exchange and capability advertisement. BANDAID introduces a leaf zone convention (e.g., _agents.example.com) containing Service Binding (SVCB) records (e.g., chat._agents.example.com) that encode application-specific metadata. These records enable agents to retrieve operational parameters prior to initiating a session, supporting both targeted lookups and capability-based discovery. The approach leverages existing DNS infrastructure, including DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD), DNSSEC, and DANE, to provide integrity, authenticity, and automation without requiring human intervention. Lastly, the draft for Domain Control Validation (DCV) proposes a best current practice to prove an agent is authorized to act on behalf of a domain. _This document proposes no change to the structure of DNS messages, and no new operation codes, response codes, resource record types, or any other new DNS protocol values._</t>
