      <t>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can be used to provide means of personal, terminal, and service mobility in a mobile Internet. This document describes two schemes for supporting service mobility in a SIP environment. The first assumes that call states are maintained and stored within the network and home network always controls calls and services of its subscribers. The second assumes that call states are stored in the mobile stations (MSs) and managed in a distributed manner, and the visited network controls users' calls and services.</t>
