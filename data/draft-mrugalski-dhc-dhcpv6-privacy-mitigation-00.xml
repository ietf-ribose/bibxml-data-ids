      <t>There is work ongoing in the dhc working group that discusses the various identifiers used by DHCPv6 and the potential privacy implications. This draft explores several migitation techniques that could be used to address the privacy issues in DHCPv6. This draft is expected to evolve significantly over time, but the ultimate goal is to standardize mitigation techniques the DHC working group considers useful.</t>
