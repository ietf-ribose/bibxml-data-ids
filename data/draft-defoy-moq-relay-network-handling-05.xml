    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a mechanism for conveying media-frame metadata for low-latency, high-throughput traffic such as Extended Reality (XR). It enables the Media over QUIC (MoQ) protocol to carry frame-level information defined by 3GPP to support functions including energy efficiency and congestion management in wireless networks. Because MoQ traffic is end-to-end encrypted, MoQ relays are expected to extract the metadata needed to perform these functions.</t>
