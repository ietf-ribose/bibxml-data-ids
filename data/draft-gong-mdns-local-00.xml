    <abstract>
      <t>Link-local networks such as home Internet of Things (IoT) and industrial Internet of Things are becoming increasingly prosperous, with a large number of small devices deployed in the link-local networks. These devices discover each other through ".local." domain names of DNS-based zero-configuration network protocol. However, the lack of specialized security operations to supervise link-local DNS resolution leads to some security risks. This memo addresses the potential risks associated with the leakage of link-local DNS traffic to external networks, the lack of identity authentication on ".local." domain requests, and the lack of rate-limiting on ".local." domain responses, which poses the leakage of link-local device information and the risk of DDoS attacks. Furthermore, the document proposes a set of best practices and technical solutions to mitigate these risks and ensure that ".local." domain name resolution remains confined within the local network segment.</t>
