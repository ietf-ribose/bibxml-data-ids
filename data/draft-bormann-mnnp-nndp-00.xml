      <t>This document describes an architecture and a set of protocols for distributing Netnews [RFC0977, RFC1036] via IP multicast enabled networks. The architecture is designed to be useful in the global Internet. In particular, it allows multiple news servers to cooperate on multicasting each new article only once. To facilitate scalability to tens of thousands of news servers, it also provides for receive-only multicast participants (that continue to send articles via conventional NNTP). This document is a submission to the IETF MNNP working group. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working groups' mailing list at ietf-mnnp@va.pubnix.com and/or the author.</t>
