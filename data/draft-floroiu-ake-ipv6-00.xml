      <t>This document proposes an authenticated key exchange scheme enabling twonodes to establish a security association in a way robust to man in themiddle attacks. The scheme is based on owner-bound IP addresses and DNSlookups.The proposed scheme relies on the fact that an attacker cannot timelyproduce a piece of information to match the output of a one wayfunction.</t>
