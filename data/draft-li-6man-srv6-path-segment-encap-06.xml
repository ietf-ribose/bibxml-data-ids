    <abstract>
      <t>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths by encoding an ordered list of instructions, called "segments". The SR architecture can be implemented over an IPv6 data plane, called SRv6. In some use-cases such as end-to-end SR Path Protection and Performance Measurement (PM), an SRv6 path needs to be identified. An SRv6 Path Segment can be used for identifying an SRv6 path. This document defines a P-flag in the Segment Routing Header to indicate the appearence of SRv6 Path Segment.</t>
