      <t>This memo documents problems with the DIGEST-MD5 Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) mechanism, as specified in RFC 2831. This document recommends DIGEST-MD5 to be marked as OBSOLETE in the IANA Registry of SASL mechanims and RFC 2831 to be moved to Historic status.Note A revised version of this draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as a Proposed Standard for the Internet Community. Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to ietf-sasl@imc.org.</t>
