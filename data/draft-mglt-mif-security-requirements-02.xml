      <t>Multiple Interface Nodes (MIF Nodes) may use their Multiple Interfaces to perform Mobility, Multihoming. Then, these MIF Nodes may also manage traffic between these Multiple Interfaces. Because IPsec has not been designed for Multiple Interfaces, MIF Nodes have difficulties to benefit from MIF features with IPsec protected communications. This document provides use cases where IPsec protected communications would take advantage of MIF features. From these uses cases, we identify the different IPsec features MIF Nodes would require. Then, we expose the limitations of the IPsec related protocols IKEv2 and MOBIKE regarding to these MIF features before listing the MIF IPsec Security Requirements that should be address by a extension of IKEv2 or MOBIKE.</t>
