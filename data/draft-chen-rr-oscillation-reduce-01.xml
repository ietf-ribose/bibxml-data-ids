      <t>This document proposes a simple revision to Route Reflection thatallows a Route Reflector to send a route advertisement (instead of aroute withdraw) in certain cases. The route advertisement helpsnarrow the gap between Route Reflection and IBGP full-mesh in termsof routing information. It has been shown that the proposed mechanismhelps achieve stable route selection and eliminate a number ofpersistent route oscillations involving Route Reflection.</t>
