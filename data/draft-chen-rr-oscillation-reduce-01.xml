      <t>This document proposes a simple revision to Route Reflection that allows a Route Reflector to send a route advertisement (instead of a route withdraw) in certain cases. The route advertisement helps narrow the gap between Route Reflection and IBGP full-mesh in terms of routing information. It has been shown that the proposed mechanism helps achieve stable route selection and eliminate a number of persistent route oscillations involving Route Reflection.</t>
