    <abstract>
      <t>Recently there has been widespread interest in using Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) as a substrate for other applications-level protocols. This document relates current IESG and IAB thinking on technical particulars of such use, including use of default ports, URL schemes, and HTTP security mechanisms. This thinking is subject to change as discussion continues and more experience is gained with such use.</t>
