      <t>This memo documents a proposed mechanism for a first stage of atransition from an unsigned DNS root to a signed root, such thatthe data in the root zone is accompanied by DNSSEC signatures toallow validation.The underlying reason for signing the root is to be able to providea more secure DNS hierarchy, where it is possible to distinguishfalse answers from correct answers. For the special case of the DNS root zone, an interim scheme isproposed. This scheme is mostly aimed at securing the root zoneitself for technical and operational reasons, and to giveoperational experience of DNSSEC.</t>
