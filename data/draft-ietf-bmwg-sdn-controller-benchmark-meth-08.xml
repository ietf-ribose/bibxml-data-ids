    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the methodologies for benchmarking control plane performance of SDN controllers. SDN controller is a core component in software-defined networking architecture that controls the network behavior. Terminology related to benchmarking SDN controllers is described in the companion terminology documentI-D sdn-controller-benchmark-term. SDN controllers have been implemented with many varying designs in order to achieve their intended network functionality. Hence, the authors have taken the approach of considering an SDN controller as a black box, defining the methodology in a manner that is agnostic to protocols and network services supported by controllers. The intent of this document is to provide a standard mechanism to measure the performance of all controller implementations.</t>
