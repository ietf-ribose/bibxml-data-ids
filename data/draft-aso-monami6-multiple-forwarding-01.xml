      <t>This document considers a mobile terminal with multiple interfaceswhich uses Mobile IPv6[1]. With multiple interfaces, the mobileterminal may use them simultaneously for communication with a peerdevice. Hence enabling the mobile terminal to achieve faulttolerance, load balancing and so on. This document deals with themobile terminal with multiple interfaces, so it is possible that eachkind/type of interface may have its own characteristics ordifferences.In particular, we take a closer look at the path between mobileterminal and its home agent. In the case when the mobile terminalhas multiple interfaces, there exists several paths to the homeagent. A general approach would be to first take a look at effectiveuse of the multiple interfaces from a pure Mobile IPv6 perspective.As a matter of course, RFC3775 is used as the basic reference withwhich we consider the multiple interfaced mobile terminal operatingin a Mobile IPv6 environment.</t>
