      <t>The use of centralized mobility management approaches -- such asMobile IPv6 -- poses some difficulties to operators of current andfuture networks, due to the expected large number of mobile users andtheir exigent demands. All this has triggered the need fordistributed mobility management alternatives, that alleviateoperators' concerns allowing for cheaper and more efficient networkdeployments.This draft describes a possible way of achieving a distributedmobility behavior with Client Mobile IP, based on Mobile IPv6 and theuse of Cryptographic Generated Addresses.</t>
