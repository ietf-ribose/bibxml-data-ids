      <t>HTTP was designed to be an extremely lightweight stateless protocol based on TCP. However actual implementation experience suggests that the overhead inherent in establishing a separate TCP connection for every request represents a significant performance problem. This proposal suggests an optional facility for HTTP version 1.1 which allows a client to create persistent connections with a server. This facility is also designed to work with proxy servers.</t>
