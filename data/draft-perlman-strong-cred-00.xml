    <abstract>
      <t>In a strong password-based protocol, the only thing the client needs to know is the user's password, and an eavesdropper, or someone impersonating either end, cannot do off-line password-guessing attacks. This sort of protocol can be used for credentials download, or for mutual authentication. Although password-based mutual authentication protocols can be used for credentials download, they are designed with some properties (such as not storing a password- equivalent at the server) that are not important in a credentials- download protocol. Therefore, a protocol designed specifically for credentials download can be fewer messages, higher performance at the server, and allow the server to operate in a stateless manner. Therefore it is possible, even likely, that different protocols might be preferable in one case (credentials download) than another.</t>
