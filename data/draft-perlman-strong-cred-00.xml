    <abstract>
      <t>In a strong password-based protocol, the only thing the client needsto know is the user's password, and an eavesdropper, or someoneimpersonating either end, cannot do off-line password-guessingattacks. This sort of protocol can be used for credentials download,or for mutual authentication. Although password-based mutualauthentication protocols can be used for credentials download, theyare designed with some properties (such as not storing a password-equivalent at the server) that are not important in a credentials-download protocol. Therefore, a protocol designed specifically forcredentials download can be fewer messages, higher performance at theserver, and allow the server to operate in a stateless manner.Therefore it is possible, even likely, that different protocols mightbe preferable in one case (credentials download) than another.</t>
