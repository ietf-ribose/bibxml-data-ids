      <t>The purpose of the INFO request for the Session Initiation Protocol(SIP), as described by RFC 2976, is to provide mid-session SIP UserAgent (UA)-to-SIP UA application data transport. In the years sincethe introduction of the INFO request, experience with the use of theINFO request indicates a number of problems. This document explainswhy there are INFO-based, proprietary protocols in the wild; theflaws of using INFO; and explains why it is not possible to create aframework to rescue INFO for general purpose use. Since SIP hasevolved considerably since the introduction of INFO, this documenthighlights some of the new, robust mechanisms for achieving the workthat previously led people to use INFO. As these mechanisms are nowavailable, this document formally deprecates the use of INFO for newusages beyond the existing standardized ones, namely RFC 3372 (SIP-T)and RFC 4497 (QSIG).Conventions Used in this DocumentThe key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].</t>
