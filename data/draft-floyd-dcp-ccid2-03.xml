      <t>This document contains the profile for Congestion Control Identifier 2, TCP-like Congestion Control, in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) [DCCP]. DCCP implements a congestion-controlled, unreliable flow of datagrams suitable for use by applications such as streaming media. The TCP-like Congestion Control CCID is used by senders who are able to adapt to the abrupt changes in the congestion window typical of the AIMD (Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease) congestion control in TCP. TCP-like Congestion Control is particularly useful for senders who would like to take advantage of the available bandwidth in an environment with rapidly changing conditions</t>
