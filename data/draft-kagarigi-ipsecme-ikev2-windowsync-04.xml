      <t>IKEv2 and IPsec protocols are widely used for deploying VPN. Inorder to make such VPN highly available and failure-prone, these VPNsare implemented as IKEv2/IPsec Highly Available (HA) cluster. Butthere are many issues in IKEv2/IPsec HA cluster. The draft "IPsecCluster Problem Statement" enumerates all the issues encountered inIKEv2/IPsec HA cluster environment.This draft proposes an extension to IKEv2 protocol to solve mainissues of "IPsec Cluster Problem Statement" in Hot Standby clusterand gives implementation advice for others. The main issues to besolved are:o IKE Message Id synchronization : This is done by obtaining themessage Id values from the peer and updating the values at thenewly active cluster member after the failover.o IPsec SA Counter synchronization : This is done by sendingincremented the values of replay counters by the newly activecluster member to the peer as expected replay counter value.</t>
