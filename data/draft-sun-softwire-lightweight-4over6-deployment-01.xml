      <t>Lightweight 4over6 is a mechanism which moves the translation function from tunnel lwAFTR (AFTR) to lwB4s (B4s), and hence reduces the mapping scale on the lwAFTR to per-customer level. This document discusses various deployment models of Lightweight 4over6. It also describes the deployment considerations and applicability of the Lightweight 4over6 architecture.</t>
