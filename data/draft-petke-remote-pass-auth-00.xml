      <t>Remote Passphrase Authentication provides a way to authenticate a user to a service by using a pass phrase over an insecure network, without revealing the pass phrase to eavesdroppers. In addition, the service need not know and does not learn the user's pass phrase, making this scheme useful in distributed environments where it would be difficult or inappropriate to trust a service with a pass phrase database or to allow the server to learn enough to masquerade as the user in a future authentication attempt. This scheme was inspired by Dave Raggett's Mediated Digest Authentication, draft-ietf-http-mda-00.txt. This specification is divided into five parts. Part Zero contains an extended introduction to the problem and potential solutions. Part One explains the mechanism. Part Two explains how to incorporate the mechanism into HTTP. Part Three explains the protocol between the service and deity. Part Four explains the GSS-API token formats. Feel free to start with Part One; Part Zero provides background information and is not a prerequisite for Part One.</t>
