      <t>The CAPWAP control channel and data channel split architecture has some benefits, such as relieving the capacity pressure of the AC, which has been discussed in [I-D.ietf-opsawg-capwap-alt-tunnel] and [I-D.xue-opsawg-capwap-separation-capability]. However, only single- provider scenario is considered so far. This document discusses the third-party WLAN service provider scenario (i.e. multi-provider), and proposes to extend CAPWAP for supporting this use case.</t>
