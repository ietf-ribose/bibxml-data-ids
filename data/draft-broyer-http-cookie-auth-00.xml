      <t>This document specifies an HTTP authentication scheme for use whencredentials are validated by an out-of-band mechanism (not definedhere) and later communicated to the server through the use of acookie. Which out-of-band mechanism should be used, and how, isdescribed by the 401 (Unauthorized) response body. It is commonpractice that this mechanism is an HTML form, sending the user'scredentials with the use of an HTTP POST request to a tier URL whichwill set a cookie in response; though this document doesn't precludethe use of other mechanisms.</t>
