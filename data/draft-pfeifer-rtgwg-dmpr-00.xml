      <t>Dynamic MultiPath Routing (DMPR) is a loop free path vector routing protocol with built-in support for policy based multipath routing. It has been designed from scratch to work at both low and high bandwidth networks - even with high packet loss. The objective was to keep routing overhead low and ensure a deterministic upper limit. DMPR can be used to manage huge networks with a similar feature set as BGPv4 except for the concept of autonomous systems.</t>
