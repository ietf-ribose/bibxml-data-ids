      <t>We describe a market mechanism for providing incentive for the reviewof IETF documents. Reviewers would be 'paid' by the IESG to for theirreviews. In turn, document authors would need to 'pay' the IESG totake up their documents. This mechanism rewards reviewers for theirreviews, thus (hopefully) increasing the quantity and quality ofreviews.</t>
