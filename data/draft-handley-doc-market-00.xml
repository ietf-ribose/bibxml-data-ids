      <t>We describe a market mechanism for providing incentive for the review of IETF documents. Reviewers would be 'paid' by the IESG to for their reviews. In turn, document authors would need to 'pay' the IESG to take up their documents. This mechanism rewards reviewers for their reviews, thus (hopefully) increasing the quantity and quality of reviews.</t>
