      <t>Several techniques are being developed which use IS-IS to deliver link state based layer 2 forwarding. The superset of the extensions proposed to IS-IS to allow these capabilities is found in [IS-IS- L2]. One technique for layer 2 forwarding is being specified in the IEEE 802.1aq task group, under the over-arching title of "Shortest Path Bridging" (SPB). SPB however only requires a subset of the proposed IS-IS extensions in [IS-IS-L2]. For clarity this informational draft documents only the subset required by SPB. In addition a high level introduction, describing how these TLVs are used is provided for those who do not follow the IEEE work in detail. A reference is also given to the normative IEEE 802.1aq document The ordering of material in this document follows that of Clause 28 of IEEE 802.1aq, to aid cross-referencing.</t>
