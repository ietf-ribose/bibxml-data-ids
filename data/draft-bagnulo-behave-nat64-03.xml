      <t>NAT64 is a mechanism for translating IPv6 packets to IPv4 packets andvice-versa. DNS64 is a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA records fromA records. These two mechanisms together enable client-servercommunication between an IPv6-only client and an IPv4-only server,without requiring any changes to either the IPv6 or the IPv4 node,for the class of applications that work through NATs. They alsoenable peer-to-peer communication between an IPv4 and an IPv6 node,where the communication can be initiated by either end usingexisting, NAT-traversing, peer-to-peer communication techniques.This document specifies NAT64, and gives suggestions on how theyshould be deployed.</t>
