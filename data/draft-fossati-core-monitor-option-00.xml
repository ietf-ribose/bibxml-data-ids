      <t>This memo defines Monitor, an additional Option for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) especially targeted at sleepy sensors. The Monitor Option complements the typical Observe pattern, enabling the tracking of a resource hosted by a node sleeping most of the time, by taking care of establishing and maintaining an Observe relationship with the (sleepy) origin on behalf of the (sleepy) client.</t>
