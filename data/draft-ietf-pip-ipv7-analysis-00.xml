      <t>This document describes how the IPv7 proposal called EIPIP (Extended IP using PIP) meets the evaluation criteria established by the Internet Engineering Steering Group and described in 'RFC-1380 IESG Deliberations on Routing and Addressing'. EIPIP is currently developed to be both a transition mechanism for a new IP protocol (PIP), and the new IP protocol. This document also includes how EIPIP meets the criteria described by Partridge/Kastenholz in their Internet Draft 'Criteria for Choosing IP Version 7 (IPv7)'.</t>
