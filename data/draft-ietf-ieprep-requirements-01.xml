    <abstract>
      <t>This document outlines user requirements for IP-based networks to enable and support an authorized emergency telecommunications service (ETS)for use by authorities to organize and coordinate emergency and disaster relief operations. It provides a basis from which ETS can be negotiated to provide user-acceptable communications. The requirements in this document relate to user expectation and are general, functional, and intended to provide wide latitude in implementation options. This document also provides in-depth background on the state of emergency telecommunication capabilities as they exist today and the motivation for supporting these in IP networks. Specific system requirements involving end-to-end and network issues are presented in [2].</t>
