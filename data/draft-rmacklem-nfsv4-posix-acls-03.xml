      <t>This document describes a potential protocol extension involving the addition of four new attributes to be used by servers to provide support for POSIX ACLs. The term POSIX ACLs refers to the ACL component of the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) 1003.1e draft 17 [IEEE] document for which sponsorship was withdrawn in January 1998. Although the draft POSIX standard that describes these ACLs was never ratified, several POSIX-based operating systems, such as Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD include support for them. The NFS Version 4 (NFSv4) ACLs described in [RFC8881] henceforth referred to as NFSv4 ACLs, use a different model and attempts to map between the ACLs of these two models have not been completely successful. In order to adequately support POSIX ACLs, this document proposes four new attributes that may optionally be used by an NFS Version 4, minor version 2 (NFSv4.2) server to support ACLs that conform to the aforementioned POSIX 1003.1e draft 17.</t>
