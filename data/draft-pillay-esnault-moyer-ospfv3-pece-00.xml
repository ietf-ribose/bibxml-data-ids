      <t>Many Service Providers (SPs) offer the Virtual Private Network (VPN)services to their customers, using a technique in which Customer Edge(CE) routers are routing peers of Provider Edge (PE) routers. TheBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used to distribute the customer'sroutes across the provider's IP backbone network, and MultiprotocolLabel Switching (MPLS) is used to tunnel customer packets across theprovider's backbone. This is known as a "BGP/MPLS IP VPN".Originally only IPv4 was supported and it was later extended tosupport IPv6 VPNs as well. Extensions were later added for thesupport of the Open Shortest Path First protocol version 2 (OSPFv2)as a PE-CE routing protocol for the IPv4 VPNs. This document extendsthose specifications to support OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3) as a PE-CErouting protocol. The OSPFv3 PE-CE functionality is identical tothat of OSPFv2 except for the differences described in this document.</t>
