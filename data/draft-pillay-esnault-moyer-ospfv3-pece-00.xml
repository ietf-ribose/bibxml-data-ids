      <t>Many Service Providers (SPs) offer the Virtual Private Network (VPN) services to their customers, using a technique in which Customer Edge (CE) routers are routing peers of Provider Edge (PE) routers. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used to distribute the customer's routes across the provider's IP backbone network, and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is used to tunnel customer packets across the provider's backbone. This is known as a "BGP/MPLS IP VPN". Originally only IPv4 was supported and it was later extended to support IPv6 VPNs as well. Extensions were later added for the support of the Open Shortest Path First protocol version 2 (OSPFv2) as a PE-CE routing protocol for the IPv4 VPNs. This document extends those specifications to support OSPF version 3 (OSPFv3) as a PE-CE routing protocol. The OSPFv3 PE-CE functionality is identical to that of OSPFv2 except for the differences described in this document.</t>
