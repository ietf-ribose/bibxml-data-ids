      <t>This memo is an implementation report about the peer-to-peer SIP system developed in the European IST Ambient Networks research project. This system replaces the traditional SIP proxy-registrar function with a distributed lookup mechanism, adds overlay functionality to the SIP signalling and to RTP traffic, takes care about media/packet relay lookup and insertion into the SIP/RTP paths, plus automatic adaptation of the voice transmission according to changing network conditions. Standard, unmodified SIP user agents are used for communication. The presented system is work in progress and this memo is an attempt to gather IETF community feedback about the described approach.</t>
