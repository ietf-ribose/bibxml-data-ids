      <t>Mailbox names often represent the names of human users. Many of these users throughout the world have names that are not normally represented by the users with just the ASCII repertoire of characters, and would therefore like to use their real names in their mailbox names. This protocol describes how mail clients can be enhanced to display mailbox names in non-ASCII characters through the use of a new RFC 2822 header field called 'Address-map'.</t>
