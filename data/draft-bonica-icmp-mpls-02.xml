      <t>The current memo documents extensions to ICMP that permit Label Switching Routers to append MPLS header information to ICMP messages. These ICMP extensions support an MPLS aware traceroute application that network operators can use to trace paths through the MPLS user plane. Although these extensions are not being proposed as Internet Standards, they are documented here because they have been implemented by several vendors and deployed by several operators.</t>
