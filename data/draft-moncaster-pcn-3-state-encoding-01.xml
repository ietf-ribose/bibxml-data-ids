      <t>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a mechanism designed to protectthe Quality of Service of inelastic flows. It does this by markingpackets when traffic load on a link is approaching or has exceeded athreshold below the physical link rate. This baseline encodingspecified how two encoding states could be encoded into the IPheader. This document specified an extension to the baselineencoding that enables three encoding states to be carried in the IPheader as well as enabling limited support for end-to-end ECN.Status (to be removed by RFC Editor)This memo is posted as an Internet-Draft with an intent to eventuallybe published as an experimental RFC. The PCN Working Group will beasked to adopt this memo as a Working Group document describing oneof several possible experimental PCN encoding schemes. The intentionis that the title of this document will change to avoid confusionwith the three state marking scheme.Changes from previous draftsFrom 00 to 01:o Checked terminology for consistency with[I-D.ietf-pcn-baseline-encoding]o Minor editorial changes.</t>
