      <t>iKP - the Internet Keyed Payments protocol - defines an architecture for secure payments involving three or more participants. 'Architecture' means that iKP specifies a base protocol with a number of options that can be selected to meet varying business or security requirements. 'Secure payments' means that iKP employs cryptographic techniques to minimize potential risks concerning payments over the open Internet. 'Three or more parties' means that iKP addresses scenarios in which buyers and sellers invoke third-parties such as credit card systems or banks to accomplish payment transactions.</t>
