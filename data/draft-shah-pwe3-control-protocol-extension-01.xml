      <t>This document describes a mechanism along with extensions to [PWE3- CONTROL] draft that enable a PE to signal to the remote PE additional dynamic information about the pseudowire. This information may either be related to the operations of the pseudowire such as operational state of the Attachment circuit, the state of the pseudowire forwarders, the IP address and/or MAC address of the attached CE, or may affect the setup of the pseudowire, such as traffic engineering parameters, security related information, etc.</t>
