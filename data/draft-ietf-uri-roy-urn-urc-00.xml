      <t>This document describes how the author would implement Uniform Resource Names (URNs) and Uniform Resource Characteristics (URCs), such that the basic concepts and technology can be usable by today's World-Wide Web clients and servers. It is intended to identify the key ingredients which make the WWW extensible and open to the introduction of URNs and URCs, and thereby steer the implementors of URI technology toward more consistent solutions.</t>
