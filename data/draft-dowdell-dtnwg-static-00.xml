      <t>Static Routing in Delay-Tolerant Networks cannot make full use of standard IPv4 or IPv6 static routing as defined in section 7.4 of [RFC1812], due to the DTN feature of Late Binding where the IP address or addresses associated with an Endpoint Identifier may not be known when a packet is originated. This draft presents a specification for static routing in the DTN environment.</t>
