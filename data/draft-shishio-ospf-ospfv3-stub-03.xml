      <t>OSPFv3 accommodates for the possibility to indicate through the R-bitif a router is an active router and should be taken intoconsideration as a transit device. Another method available is thev6-bit indicating if a router or link should be excluded from IPv6routing calculations.A direct result is that OSPFv3 has "no transit capability"potentially based upon the setting of R-bit and V6-bit, unlike thestub OSPFv2 router functionality. This feature proposal has aspurpose to re-introduce existing OSPFv2 stub router behavior intoOSPFv3 to keep the operational service provider experience used todeploy, troubleshoot and be familiar with OSPFv2 stub routing.OSPFv3 has similar metric field information field of all of LSAs,with exception of the Link-LSA, so RFC3137 method can be re-utilizedin OSPFv3.To drive consistency between OSPFv2 and OSPFv3, there should be nextto supporting both R-bit and v6-bit be support for"max-metric".</t>
