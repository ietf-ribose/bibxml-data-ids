      <t>One of the potential problems with the "map-and-encapsulate"approaches to routing architecture is that there is a significantchance of packets being dropped while a mapping is being retrieved.Some approaches pre-load ingress tunnel routers with at least part ofthe mapping database. Some approaches try to solve this by providingintermediate "default" routers which have a great deal more knowledgethan a typical ingress tunnel router. This document proposes ascheme which does not drop packets yet does not require a great dealof knowledge in any router. However, there are still some issuesthat need to be worked out.</t>
