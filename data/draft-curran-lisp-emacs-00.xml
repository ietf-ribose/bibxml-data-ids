      <t>One of the potential problems with the "map-and-encapsulate" approaches to routing architecture is that there is a significant chance of packets being dropped while a mapping is being retrieved. Some approaches pre-load ingress tunnel routers with at least part of the mapping database. Some approaches try to solve this by providing intermediate "default" routers which have a great deal more knowledge than a typical ingress tunnel router. This document proposes a scheme which does not drop packets yet does not require a great deal of knowledge in any router. However, there are still some issues that need to be worked out.</t>
