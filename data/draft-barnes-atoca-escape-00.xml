      <t>Recipients of emergency alerts need to be able to verify that an alert they receive was issued by an authorized source. The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) provides a standard way of encoding alert information, but does not provide any security features that would support authentication of alert originators. This document describes a security wrapper for Common Alerting Protocol objects to allow alerts to be signed by alert originators. Please send feedback to the atoca@ietf.org mailing list.</t>
