      <t>This document describes an additional Rx remote procedure call that may be used to obtain the size of an AFS-3 volume dump from an AFS-3 Volume Service. While an RPC already exists for this purpose (AFSVolGetSize), this document proposes a more flexible mechanism that is able to more accurately determine the size of a volume dump in a greater number of cases. Internet Draft Comments Comments regarding this draft are solicited. Please include the AFS-3 protocol standardization mailing list (afs3-standardization@openafs.org) as a recipient of any comments.</t>
