      <t>This document describes a two-stage call-setup mechanism, with the resource management protocol interleaved between the two stages. The objective of such a mechanism is to enable deployment of robust IP Telephony services. The first phase ensures that resources are made available before the phone rings and the participants of the call are 'invited' to participate. The second phase involves the alerting of the user after the network resources are reserved. This draft presents the call signaling requirements that lead to this design, and the specific SIP extension of an INVITE that does not ring the far-end phone.</t>
