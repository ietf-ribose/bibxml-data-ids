      <t>This document describes a two-stage call-setup mechanism, with theresource management protocol interleaved between the two stages. Theobjective of such a mechanism is to enable deployment of robust IPTelephony services. The first phase ensures that resources are madeavailable before the phone rings and the participants of the callare 'invited' to participate. The second phase involves the alertingof the user after the network resources are reserved. This draftpresents the call signaling requirements that lead to this design,and the specific SIP extension of an INVITE that does not ring thefar-end phone.</t>
