      <t>In SIMPLE based presence and messaging applications, it is necessary for the user to be able to configure a number of pieces of information. One of the most common types of information is a list of URIs. List management is useful outside the scope of SIMPLE as well, for instance in conferencing. There are many reasons why it would be beneficial to manage the lists in a similar fashion regardless of the application. Before the selection of the actual protocol(s) to manage the lists there is a need to describe their semantics on an abstract level. This document proposes the semantics for SIMPLE list manipulation protocol.</t>
