    <abstract>
      <t>The Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution provides Designated Forwarder election procedures for multihomed Ethernet Segments. These procedures have been enhanced further by applying Highest Random Weight (HRW) algorithm for Designated Forwarder (DF) election in order to avoid unnecessary DF status changes upon a failure. This document improves these procedures by providing a fast Designated Forwarder election upon recovery of the failed link or node associated with the multihomed Ethernet Segment. The solution is independent of the number of EVIs associated with that Ethernet Segment and it is performed via a simple signaling between the recovered PE and each of the other PEs in the multihoming group.</t>
