      <t>Many presence applications use availability information about a presentity to show a watcher their readiness to communicate. In the case of real-time multimedia communications, the readiness of the presentity to communicate does not entail that the network topography will permit communication to occur. Accordingly, this document specifies a means to integrate Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) with presence. Presentities employing the Presence Information Data Format (PIDF) can use the extensions in this draft to advertise their ability to undergo a preliminary ICE check, and thus allow watchers to instigate ICE tests to ascertain whether or not the intervening network is friendly to real-time multimedia communication. In a presence application, the results of this test could be displayed to watchers as the relative "connectivity status" of the presentity.</t>
