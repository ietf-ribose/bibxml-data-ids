    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents an extension to the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol for the purpose of a group key management. The protocol is in conformance with the Multicast Security (MSEC) key management architecture, which contains two components: member registration and group rekeying. Both components require a Group Controller/Key Server to download IPsec group security associations to authorized members of a group. The group members then exchange IP multicast or other group traffic as IPsec packets. This document obsoletes RFC 6407. This documents also updates RFC 7296 by renaming one of transform types defined there.</t>
