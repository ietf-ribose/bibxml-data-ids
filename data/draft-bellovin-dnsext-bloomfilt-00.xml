      <t>Some aspects of DNSSEC, such as NXDOMAIN error messages, require an authenticated answer. Producing this answer requires complex mechanisms, online storage of the zone's secret key, expensive online computations, or massive zone files. As an alternative, we propose storage of authenticated pointers to Bloom filters. This scheme provides large reductions in the size of, and computational expense to produce, partially-signed zone files.</t>
