      <t>This paper create a method using a simple implementation to inform the traffic source at a very early stage that the network is becoming overload or congested and to ask the source to slow down its transmission rate. For simplicity, the network only indicates congesition to the node where data transmission rate will be reduced or increased adaptively. For the consideration of asymmetric routing and to shorten long control delay time, the congestion notification message generated for the incipient congestion in the network should immediately routed back according to its source address. Upon receiving this message, the source terminal discards this message and immediately initiates its congestion control, then it sends message to tell the network node to stop adding it.</t>
