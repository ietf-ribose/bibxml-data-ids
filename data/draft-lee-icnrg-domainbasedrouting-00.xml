      <t>This memo describes a scalable routing scheme for information centric networks. Moving the focus from "nodes" to "information objects" raises scalability issue because aggregation of flat name for objects is not easy task and the number of addressable information objects is so huge than the IP address space. For scalable routing, we propose hierarchically-organized domain architecture. A domain is a "logical group" of information objects and each domain has its own ID. The concatenation of domain IDs from top level domain to the current domain plays the role of "locator". Thus, we can get scalable routing table and it is more scalable by means of "topology reduction". More challenging issue is name-based forwarding. It is hard to aggregate forwarding table due to flat name space, therefore we propose "reactive path setup".</t>
