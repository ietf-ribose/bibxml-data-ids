      <t>6to4 [1] defines a mechanism for allowing sites to communicateusing IPv6 over the public IPv4 Internet. It does so by assigning ablock of IPv6 addresses corresponding to any 'public' (globally-scoped)IPv4 address, and a means of tunneling IPv6 traffic destined for suchaddresses over the IPv4 Internet. In this way, any site which isconnected to the IPv4 Internet and which has at least one global IPv4address assigned to it, can communicate with IPv6.</t>
