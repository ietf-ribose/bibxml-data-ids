      <t>Proxy servers play a central role as an intermediary in theestablishment of sessions in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).In that role, they define and impact policies on call routing,rendezvous, and other call features. However, there is no standardmeans by which network elements can have any influence on sessionpolicies, such as the codecs that are to be used. As such, ad-hoc andnon-conformant techniques have been deployed to allow for suchsession policy mechanisms. In this document, we discuss a completeand standards-based mechanism for session policies.</t>
