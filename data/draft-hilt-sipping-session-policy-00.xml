      <t>Proxy servers play a central role as an intermediary in the establishment of sessions in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). In that role, they define and impact policies on call routing, rendezvous, and other call features. However, there is no standard means by which network elements can have any influence on session policies, such as the codecs that are to be used. As such, ad-hoc and non-conformant techniques have been deployed to allow for such session policy mechanisms. In this document, we discuss a complete and standards-based mechanism for session policies.</t>
