      <t>This document defines a standard profile for Bogon OriginAttestations (BOAs). A BOA is a digitally signed object thatprovides a means of verifying that an IP address block holder has notauthorized any Autonomous System (AS) to originate routes that areequivalent to any of the addresses listed in the BOA, and alsoprovides a means of verifying that BGP speaker is not using an AS asa BGP speaker without appropriate authority to use that AS. Theproposed application of BOAs is intended to fit within therequirements for adding security measures to inter-domain routing,including the ability to support incremental and piecemeal deploymentof such measures, and does not require any changes to thespecification of BGP.</t>
