      <t>This document describes an extension to the naming mechanism ofdisruption tolerant networks (RFC4838) to support intentional naming.Intentional naming is a means by which a source node specifies thedestination node(s) for a bundle in terms of predicates on attributesof the node(s), instead of by a canonical endpoint identifier (EID)of the node. Intentional naming is closely tied to the concept ofbinding, as described in RFC 4838. Since information required toroute an intentionally named bundle may not be available at thesource node, this information must be supplied at one or moresubsequent nodes along the bundle's path toward its destination(s).The architecture required for an intentional naming capability in aDTN must support the notion that a bundle can make progress towardits destination(s) in the absence of complete binding information.In this document we describe a framework for intentional naming in aDTN, propose a syntax for intentional names, and describe adistributed procedure for late or partial binding. We also presentsample use cases for late binding and a notional name bindingalgorithm, called GRAIN, that can deliver bundles to intentionalnames with geographic and role attributes, e.g. "first responderswithin a kilometer of a specified location." Finally, we discuss thelimitations in our current ability to field an ideal intentionalnaming system (i.e., one that can support generic intentional names),and we suggest a somewhat restrictive framework that is both usefuland feasible to deploy.</t>
