      <t>This document defines a protocol independent message format for requesting and reporting state related to keys or buttons. The document also defines a SIP Event Package to make use of this extensible framework through the SIP SUBSCRIBE &amp; NOTIFY messages. The draft currently defines key event sub-packages to represent the state of telephone dial pads, feature buttons found on many commercial telephones, standard keyboards as well as support for user or device specific buttons (for instance, a 'Double Latte' button). The event package and associated key packages can be used to enable new SIP services where an application or SIP entity requires notification of user interface activity either associated with a particular SIP session or simply in relation to the device itself.</t>
