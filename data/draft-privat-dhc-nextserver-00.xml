      <t>This proposal allows host configuration to be split between two different address servers, potentially under different administration. This ability may be useful to satisfy specific regulatory, operational or business model requirements, as well as to provide support for secondary address servers. This draft proposes a new DHCP option called the DHCP Next Server option. A DHCP server can use this option to redirect clients to a secondary server.</t>
