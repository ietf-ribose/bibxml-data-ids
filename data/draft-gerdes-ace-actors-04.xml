      <t>Constrained nodes are small devices which are limited in terms of processing power, memory, non-volatile storage and transmission capacity. Due to these constraints, commonly used security protocols are not easily applicable. Nevertheless, an authentication and authorization solution is needed to ensure the security of these devices. Due to the limitations of the constrained nodes it is especially important to develop a light-weight security solution which is adjusted to the relevant security objectives of each participating party in this environment. Necessary security measures must be identified and applied where needed. This document gives an overview of the necessary terminology and introduces the actors in an architecture as guidance for the development of authentication and authorization solutions for constrained environments. The actors represent the relationships between the logical functional entities involved. We also present a problem description for authentication and authorization in constrained-node networks, i.e. networks where some devices have severe constraints on memory, processing, power and communication bandwidth.</t>
