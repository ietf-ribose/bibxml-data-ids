      <t>This document defines a token format for verifying with non- repudiation the sender of and authorization to send information related to the originator of personal communications. A cryptographic signature is defined to protect the integrity of the information used to identify the originator of a personal communications session toward a terminating entity. The cryptographic signature is defined with the intention that it can confidently verify the originating persona even when the signature is sent to the terminating party over a potentially unsecure channel. The Persona Assertion Token (PASSporT) is particularly useful for many personal communications applications over IP networks and other multi-hop interconnection scenarios where the originating and terminating parties may not have a direct trusted relationship.</t>
