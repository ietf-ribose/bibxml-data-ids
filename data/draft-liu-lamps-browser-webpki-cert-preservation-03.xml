    <abstract>
      <t>The management of Web PKI certificate resources presents a challenge when the misalignment of ownership and management rights over certificate resources of one organization creating a risk of unilateral suspension and revocation by another competing organizations. This situation undermines the stability of critical infrastructure and affects the integrity of authentication systems. To address these concerns, this document proposes a mechanism that allows Internet browsers to create a customized management view of certificate resources, enabling them to override verification results from specific certification authorities as needed. This approach enhances security, facilitates stakeholder collaboration, and preserves the operational integrity of essential industry systems.</t>
