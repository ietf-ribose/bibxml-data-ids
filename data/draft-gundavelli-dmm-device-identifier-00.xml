      <t>Network Access Identifier (NAI) is an identifier used by access networks for identifying users requesting access to the network. A user may access the network using more than one device, but all using the same NAI and the associated credentials. There are various use- cases where an access network needs to unambiguously identify a device used for accessing the network, and NAI is not sufficient for such determination. This document describes a device identifier structure and also identifies the potential stable identifiers that are present on a dual-radio device which can be used as a device identifiers. This document also describes mechanisms where the device can generate device identifiers using cryptographic methods. These generated identifiers are transient in nature and are unique to a given access network. Device identifier is intended to be shared only with a trusted access network which holds the user's network access credentials and for which the identifier was generated.</t>
