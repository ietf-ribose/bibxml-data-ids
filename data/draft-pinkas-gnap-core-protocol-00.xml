      <t>This protocol enables an Authorization Server (AS) to issue access tokens to permit an end-user using a client software to perform operations on a protected resource hosted by a Resource Server (RS). These access tokens allow to support capabilities and/or user attributes. The protocol includes means of specifying how the end-user can potentially be involved in an interactive fashion during the process. The client and/or the RS will use these interaction mechanisms to involve the end-user, as necessary, to take decisions. The protocol uses HTTPS for all communications between the client and the AS, as well as between the client and the RS.</t>
