      <t>This memo describes a rate adaptation algorithm for conversational video services. The solution conforms to the packet conservation principle and uses a hybrid loss and delay based congestion control algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated over both simulated Internet bottleneck scenarios as well as in a LTE (Long Term Evolution) system simulator and is shown to achieve both low latency and high video throughput in these scenarios.</t>
