    <abstract>
      <t>In DNS operations, automated scanners are commonly employed by the operator of a parent zone to detect the presence of specific records, such as CDS or CSYNC, in child zones, indicating a desire for delegation updates. However, the presence and periodicity of these scanners are typically implicit and undocumented, leading to inefficiencies and uncertainties. ￼ This document proposes an extension to the semantics of the DSYNC resource record, as defined in [I-D.draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify], allowing parent zones to explicitly signal the presence and scanning interval of such automated scanners. This enhancement aims to improve transparency and coordination between child and parent zones.
