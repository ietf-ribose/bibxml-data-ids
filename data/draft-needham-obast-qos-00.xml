      <t>This document outlines some of the fundamental requirements and issues related to the control and maintenance of quality of service (QoS) in an Open Base Station Transport (OBAST) architecture. It begins with a review of a baseline OBAST architecture, highlighting those elements that are particularly relevant to QoS provisioning, then discusses the requirements for QoS within this framework. In particular, the requirements for control and maintenance of QoS during mobility handoffs, and for support of adaptive applications, is addressed.</t>
