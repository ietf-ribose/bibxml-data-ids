    <abstract>
      <t>This is an extension to the XDR specification to allow for bits to be described and sent. With protocols that have a large number of boolean values the existing standard requires each to be individually packed into a 32-bit value. This addition does not alter any existing XDR data streams or effect existing implementations. * This specification describes how to pack a bit-boolean and short bit-width data values into the 32-bit XDR block chunks. * And this specification describes how to describe them by extending "The XDR Language Specification" to include bits. * And a new namespace declaration type is specified to aid in the reduction of name collisions in large projects. While in draft status, a new Open Source XDR generation tool is being developed [xdrgen].</t>
