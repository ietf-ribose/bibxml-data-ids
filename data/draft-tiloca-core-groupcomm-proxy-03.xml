    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the operations performed by a forward-proxy or reverse-proxy, when using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) in group communication scenarios. Such CoAP proxy processes a single request, sent by a CoAP client over unicast, and distributes the request over IP multicast to a group of CoAP servers. It then collects the individual responses from these CoAP servers and sends these responses to the CoAP client such that the client is able to distinguish the responses and their origin servers through addressing information.</t>
