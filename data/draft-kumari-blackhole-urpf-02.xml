      <t>Remote Triggered Black Hole (RTBH) filtering is a popular and effective technique for the mitigation of denial of service attacks. This document expands upon destination-based RTBH filtering by outlining a method to enable filtering by source address as well. It also defines a standard BGP community for black hole prefixes to simplify associated semantics.</t>
