      <t>As networks migrate towards IPv6, some entities still have the requirement for IPv4 configuration. DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341] provides a mechanism for obtaining IPv4 configuration information dynamically in IPv6 networks. DHCPv4/DHCPv6 Active Leasequery allows a client to get real-time DHCP address binding information data via TCP. This document describes an extension of DHCPv6 Active Leasequery to provide an mechanism to getting real-time DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 lease information.</t>
