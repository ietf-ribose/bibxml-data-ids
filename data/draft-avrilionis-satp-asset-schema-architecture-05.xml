    <abstract>
      <t>A management architecture for asset schemas and profiles is needed to enable entities in the tokenized assets ecosystem to instantiate tokens within one or more asset networks. An asset network may be constrained to support only a select class or type of token to be present in the network. In the SATP protocol, the receiving gateway at the destination network is assumed in its preparatory stages to evaluate the transfer request of a tokenized asset from the sending gateway at the origin network. In order to evaluate the proposed transfer, the receiving gateway must have access to the asset definition schema upon which the token was based in the origin network. The current document discusses the management architecture for the asset definition schema and the schema-profiles derived from the definition schema.</t>
