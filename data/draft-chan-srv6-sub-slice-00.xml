      <t>This document describes how to achieve further slicing or traffic engineering interoperability between vendors without the use of SRH. Slicing or traffic engineering information is encapsulated as part of the SRv6 SID. Use of IP longest prefix match approach to identify the further slicing via sub- slice identifier. The traffic engineering from one end to another end is seen as segment by segment approach. This approach could solve the scalability of traffic engineering tunnels required in a huge network, which order of N^2 has be considered.</t>
