      <t>In the context of IPv4-IPv6 interconnection (or interworking),several solutions have been proposed within IETF. Some of thesesolutions require the definition of a new IPv4-Embedded IPv6 addresswhich is used to represent an IPv4-only host in an IPv6 realms andthe definition of a new mechanism called DNS64 for synthesizing aAAAA record, representing an IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address in the DNSsystem, from the A record representing the IPv4 address of the IPv4-only host . This IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address, when managed by atranslator, is to be considered as "fake" address in a DNS systemsince it is not necessarily assigned to any host's interfacequalified by the associated name.This document defines a new DNS record type and query type toidentify IPv4-Embedded IPv6 address from native IPv6 ones. The newrecord type and query type aim at helping the requesting party toenforce its policies and avoid crossing NAT64 boxes when possible.Native addresses are to be preferred.</t>
