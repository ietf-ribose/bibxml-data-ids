      <t>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are a class of networks in whichboth the routers and their interconnects are constrained. LLNrouters typically operate with constraints on processing power,memory, and energy (battery power). LLN router supported trafficflows include point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and multipoint-to-point. The IPv6 Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) provides themechanisms to support those traffic flows. The currently availablesecurity services in RPL will not protect against a compromisedinternal node that can also construct and disseminate fake messages. In this document, a service is described that prevents an internalattacker from impersonating a Destination Oriented Directed AcyclicGraph (DODAG) root. Moreover, the establishment and maintenance ofany cryptographic key is out of the scope of the current RPLproposal. In this document a service that allows nodes to agree onlocal keys with their neighborhood is also presented.</t>
