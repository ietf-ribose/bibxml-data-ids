      <t>This document introduces a new client type (COPS-ODRA) for the COPS protocol to support dynamic DiffServ admission control. The Policy Decision Point (PDP) acts as a 'Bandwidth Broker' for the Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) which is requesting resources. The use of the defined mechanism is suited for (but it is not limited to) the Integrated Services operation over Diffserv networks. This document represents the updated version of draft-salsano-issll- cops-odra-00.txt and is issued only for reference. Another new client type called COPS-DRA (Diffserv Resource Allocation) includes all the functionality of COPS-ODRA adding the support of combined Outsourcing and Provisioning model.</t>
