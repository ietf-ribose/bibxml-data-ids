      <t>LoST maps service identifiers and location information to servicecontact URIs. If a LoST client wants to discover available servicesfor a particular location, it will perform a &lt;listServicesByLocation&gt;query to the LoST server. However, the response from the LoST serverdoes not provide information about the geographical region for whichthe returned service list is valid. Therefore, this documentproposes a ServiceListBoundary to assist the client to not miss achange in available services when moving.</t>
