      <t>Some IPTV deployments that are using the Real Time Streaming Protocol(RTSP) require the ability of the server to notify clients aboutasynchronous events occurring during an RTSP session. Currentdeployments typically use the ANNOUNCE method of RTSP 1.0 for sendingsuch asynchronous events from a server to clients by using someproprietary extensions. However, the ANNOUNCE method has beenremoved from the current RTSP 2.0 draft, leaving the newspecification without a mechanism for sending asynchronous messagesfrom the server. This memo describes a use case for such anasynchronous message and proposes a new RTSP 2.0 method.</t>
