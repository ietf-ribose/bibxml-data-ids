    <abstract>
      <t>This document gives the authors' opinion of a rough outline of (1) the problems to be addressed by the proposed IETF HTTP-NG Working Group; (2) the requirements on the solution; and (3) the architecture of the solution. It draws heavily on contributions from the whole Protocol Design Group of the W3C HTTP-NG Activity. A suite of problems should be addressed, summarized as observing that the World Wide Web's tremendous success has created some strains on the Internet, its users, and its application developers. The requirements on the solution include modularity, extensibility, scalability, and efficiency. The proposed solution is to factor HTTP, the Web's central protocol, into three layers and look into performance improvements in the lower two of those resultant layers.</t>
