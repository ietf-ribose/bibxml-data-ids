    <abstract>
      <t>CBOR has many advantages over other data serialization formats. One of its strengths is specifications and guidelines for serializing data deterministically, such that multiple agents serializing the same data automatically achieve consensus on the exact byte-level form of that serialized data. Nonetheless, determinism is an opt-in feature of the specification, and most existing CBOR codecs put the primary burden of correct deterministic serialization and validation of deterministic encoding during deserialization on the engineer. This document specifies a set of norms and practices for CBOR codec implementors intended to support deterministic CBOR ("dCBOR") at the codec API level.</t>
