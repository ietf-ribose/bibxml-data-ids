    <abstract>
      <t>In this draft, we address to potential adapt authorization frameworks for the future AI agent. An extension is proposed in the OAuth 2.0 protocol with an optional field *target_id* for granular authorization. It can be seen useful for the future virtual/physical AI agents. By explicitly identifying the target during authorization, the draft aims to support precise permission management and enhance traceability. Serveral risks can be mitigated through the proposed extension, such as potential unauthorized or malicious behavior of AI components in the netowrk, while the compatibility of existing OAuth 2.0 workflows is still maintained.</t>
