      <t>A drawback with many NAT UDP hole punching techniques is thekeepalive traffic necessary to keep the UDP binding open. It itnecessary to send keepalives frequently because it is not possible todetermine or modify the NAT's binding lifetime. This keepalivetraffic causes server load and additional network traffic, which isespecially problematic with battery-operated wireless devices.This document describes two mechanisms to discover NATs and firewallsand a mechanism to query and control their binding lifetime. Withthese mechanisms, UDP binding discovery and UDP keepalive traffic canbe reduced to involve only the necessary NATs or firewalls. Thiseliminates the keepalive traffic to servers, and vastly reduceskeepalive traffic across the network. At the same time, backwardscompatibility with NATs and firewalls that do not support thisspecification is retained, which allows for incremental deployment ofthis mechanism.This document is discussed on the SAFE mailing list,&lt;http://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/safe&gt;.</t>
