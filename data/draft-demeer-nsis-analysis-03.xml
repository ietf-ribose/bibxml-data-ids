      <t>This memo provides a brief analysis of existing IP quality of service (QoS) solutions and the implied signalling issues. This analysis is intended to point out open issues in QoS signalling. Moreover, this analysis is done in order to understand whether the strict QoS requirements imposed by future fixed and mobile applications are satisfied by the existing IP QoS solutions. The existing IP QoS solutions can be categorized as follows: * End-to-end per-flow resource reservation protocols * Integrated Services over Differentiated Services * Statically assigned trunk reservations based on Differentiated Services * Dynamic trunk reservations with Aggregated RSVP</t>
