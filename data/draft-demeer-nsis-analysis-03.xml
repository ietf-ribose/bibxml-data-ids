      <t>This memo provides a brief analysis of existing IP quality of service(QoS) solutions and the implied signalling issues. This analysis isintended to point out open issues in QoS signalling. Moreover, thisanalysis is done in order to understand whether the strict QoSrequirements imposed by future fixed and mobile applications aresatisfied by the existing IP QoS solutions. The existing IP QoSsolutions can be categorized as follows:* End-to-end per-flow resource reservation protocols* Integrated Services over Differentiated Services* Statically assigned trunk reservations based onDifferentiated Services* Dynamic trunk reservations with Aggregated RSVP</t>
