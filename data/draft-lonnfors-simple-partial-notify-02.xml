      <t>A Presence service can have constraints for delivering presence information to devices with low data processing capabilities, small display, and limited battery power. Other limitations can be caused by the interface between the terminal and the network, i.e. over radio links with high latency and low bandwidth. This memo presents a solution that aids in reducing the impact of those constrains and to increase efficiency, by introducing a mechanism called partial notification.</t>
