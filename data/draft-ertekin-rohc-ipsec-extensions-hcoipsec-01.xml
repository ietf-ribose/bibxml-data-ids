      <t>Integrating RoHC with IPsec (RoHCoIPsec) offers the combined benefits of IP security services and efficient bandwidth utilization. Before this can be realized, however, several extensions to the Security Policy Database (SPD), the Security Association Database (SAD), and the IPsec process are required.
