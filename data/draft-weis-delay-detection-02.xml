      <t>This memo describes a one-way measurement of IP packet end to end delay. Delay detection is enabled by a sender of an IP Internet Protocol datagram placing a timestamp in the packet declaring the time at which it was sent. The receiver of the datagram can then judge how recently it was sent and choose a policy action, which could include discarding packets deemed to be 'too old' (having a timestamp too far into the past) or 'too new' (having a timestamp that is too far into the future).</t>
