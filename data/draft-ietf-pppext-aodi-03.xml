      <t>Always On/Dynamic ISDN (AO/DI) is a networking service that provides an always-available connection to TCP/IP-based services through a specific wide area connection. This service provides several advantages over current practices for dial-up access to Internet services. * For the end-user, there is no need to dial-up the service each time access is desired. * For the Internet service provider, it is possible to give the end-user a notification, such as the arrival of new mail. * For the Local Exchange Carrier, the switched circuit trunk utilization is more efficient.</t>
