      <t>This document is a response to the call for a working group to examine the Process for Organization of Internet Standards (POISED). The document contains one possible set of solutions to the issues examined by the POISED working group. It does not reflect a position of the working group and is not necessarily a consensus view. The document suggests the replacement of the current technology development bodies of the Internet (the IAB, IETF, IESG, and IRTF) with a new, streamlined structure. We refer to this community as the Technical Task Force of the Internet. The document also deals at length the with questions of accountability of boards to the general membership. The document recommends a set of procedures, such as open meetings, and discusses ways of handling the selection and approval process for personnel changes. The document considers many of these issues within the broader context of the Internet Society as well as the Technical Task Force.</t>
