      <t>The number of ways to subscribe-to (and to unsubscribe-from) e-mail mailing lists is as varied as the number of programmers designing mailing list software. For some lists, for example, users (un)subscribe by sending a request to &lt;listname&gt;-request@host.domain. For others lists the address is majordomo@host.domain with the request to (un)subscribe embedded in the message body. Yet others set up special hosts to satisfy this need, such as &lt;listname&gt;@list-off.domain. In this Internet Draft we offer two new e-mail headers intended to make mailing list subscription and unsubscription easier and more uniform: List-Subscribe and List-Unsubscribe.</t>
