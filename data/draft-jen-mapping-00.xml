      <t>This draft discusses the different requirements that mapping tosupport mobility has versus mapping to support routing scalability.In mobility solutions, packets are forwarded to the location wheremapping information is stored so that they can be encapsulated to thefinal destination. In routing scalability solutions, mappinginformation needs to be available at packet entry points to thenetwork. Attempts to use one mapping system for both purposes canlead to high overhead in either mapping information distribution orotherwise mapping information discovery, as well as stale mappinginformation being used for data forwarding.</t>
