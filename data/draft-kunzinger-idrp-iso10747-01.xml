      <t>This draft document contains the complete text of ISO/IEC International Standard 10747, which specifies an inter-domain routing protocol commonly referred to as 'IDRP'. It is made available in this form as part of an agreement between the Internet Society and ISO/IEC JTC1 (which is responsible for Information Technology standards as a joint activity of ISO and IEC). Those figures that could easily be rendered in ASCII are included, but it was not possible to create ASCII replicas for all figures included in the International Standard. The PostScript version of this document that includes all the figures is available (URL = ftp://merit.edu/pub/iso/idrp.ps.Z).</t>
