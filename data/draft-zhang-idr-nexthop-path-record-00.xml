      <t>As the BGP is deployed in a single Autonomous System using converged networks such as Seamless MPLS, it is desirable for BGP to carry more IGP nexthop pathway information to help select routing more intelligently. One example of a Seamless MPLS deployment is the Mobile BackHaul (MBH) deployment with multiple IGPs Areas per ASN. This document describes a new optional transitive path attribute, NEXTHOP_PATH_RECORD ATTRIBUTE for BGP that records the next hop path which can be used by BGP network management to monitor and manage the BGP infrastructure via management interfaces (such as I2RS).</t>
