      <t>SRv6 is being rapidly deployed and is currently primarily used in trusted-domain backbone networks. However, we have also observed that SRv6 is beginning to extend toward end-user devices, e.g., in SD-WAN deployments. SD-WAN can be deployed in third-party clouds or at customer sites, causing the physical boundary of SRv6 to become blurred. This introduces certain security issues, such as middlebox filtering and unauthorized access to others’ VPN in Section 8.1 and Section 6 in [I-D.draft-ietf-spring-srv6-security]. This proposal mitigates these risks by using SID as source address in SRv6 packets.</t>
