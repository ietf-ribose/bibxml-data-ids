      <t>Compound TCP (CTCP) is a modification to TCP's congestion control mechanism for use with TCP connections with large congestion windows. This document describes the Compound TCP algorithm in detail, and solicits experimentation and feedback from the wider community. The key idea behind CTCP is to add a scalable delay-based component to the standard TCP's loss-based congestion control. The sending rate of CTCP is controlled by both loss and delay components. The delay-based component has a scalable window increasing rule that not only efficiently uses the link capacity, but on sensing queue build up, proactively reduces the sending rate.</t>
