      <t>The Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVPv1) has been on the standards track within the IETF for a number of years. During that time, the level of vendor support and deployment has been relatively slow, despite the desire of many to deploy technology to deliver services with different levels of quality of service (QoS) to their customers. The reasons for this are arguably well-understood and documented and are not the focus of this memo. This memo is proposing a (NSIS Transport Layer Protocol) NTLP, that is a modified version of RSVPv1 specified in RFC2205. Furthermore, it provides design guidelines and specifications for the development of the NLTP that is based on a modified version of RSVPv1.</t>
