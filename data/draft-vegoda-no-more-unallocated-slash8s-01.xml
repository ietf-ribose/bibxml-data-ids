      <t>It has been common for network administrators to filter IP traffic coming from unallocated IPv4 address space. Now that there are no longer any unallocated IPv4 /8s, this practise is more complicated, fragile and expensive. Network administrators are advised to remove filters based on the registration status of the address space. This document explains why any remaining filters for unallocated IPv4 /8s should now be removed on border routers and documents those IPv4 unicast prefixes that should not be routed across the public Internet.</t>
