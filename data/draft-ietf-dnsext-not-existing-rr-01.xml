      <t>This draft present an alternative to NXT records, used to achieveauthenticated denial of existence of a domain name, class and type. Problems with NXT records, as specified in RFC 2535, are identified.One solution, the NO record, is presented.The NO record differ from the NXT record by using a cryptographichash value instead of the domain name. This prevent an adverseryfrom collecting information by 'chaining' through a zone. It alsoremove delegation point concerns in NXT records. The document alsodescribe hash truncation and record merging that reducesstorage/network load.</t>
