      <t>Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers. MPTCP protocol defines seven subtypes in MPTCP v0 [RFC6824] and ten subtypes in MPTCP v1 [RFC8684] to differentiate message types and implement some additional functions during a session. This draft proposes an enhancement to support Subtype Capability Exchange during MPTCP connection establishment in order to improve elastic scalability of MPTCP protocol. It includes: 1) requirements for which this kind of capability exchange during handshake is important for a MPTCP session; 2) a typical flow for Subtype Capability Exchange between peers; 3) a feasible solution on protocol design is suggested.</t>
