    <abstract>
      <t>Some Internet client entities on the Internet make inferences about the administrative relationships among services on the Internet based on the domain names at which they are offered. At present, it is not possible to ascertain organizational administrative boundaries in the DNS, therefore such inferences can be erroneous in various ways. Mitigation strategies deployed so far will not scale. The solution offered in this memo is to provide a means to make explicit assertions regarding the administrative relationships between domain names.</t>
