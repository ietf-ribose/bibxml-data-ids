      <t>This draft mainly describes centralized anycast layer 3 gateway solution in TRILL campus. Comparing to traditional VRRP based active-standby layer 3 gateway solution, this solution can achieve better load balancing and scalability. Anycast nickname, anycast gateway IP and MAC are introduced. It can ensure inter-subnet traffic forwarding in flow-based load balancing mode among all physical layer 3 gateways. To avoid sending duplicated ARP reply message to the end system, ARP master gateway election mechanism is introduced. The election algorithm is described in this draft.</t>
