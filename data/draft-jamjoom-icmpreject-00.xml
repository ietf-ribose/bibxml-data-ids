      <t>This document specifies the incorporation of a Reject message to ICMP to improve a server’s ability for controlling TCP connection requests during periods of overload beyond dropping them. The Reject message serves two purposes: (1) it can inform a connecting host (the client) to completely abort the connection attempt as if a connection timeout has expired, and (2) modify the retransmission timeout interval to reduce the client’s wait times and also to break the re-synchronization of connection requests when multiple SYN packets are dropped. Introducing an additional ICMP message, as opposed to modifying the behavior of TCP, was motivated by the need for backward compatibility (i.e., a host can ignore the ICMP Reject message without affecting the behavior of TCP) and incremental deployment.</t>
