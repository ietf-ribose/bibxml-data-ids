      <t>In a distributed network environment such as a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, it is often necessary to know that a peer is alive and, if not, detect quickly that a peer has failed and subsequently re- started. It is also necessary to detect failures where only a subset of the existing mobility sessions are affected. Furthermore, failure indication should be possible without waiting for an explicit query from a peer. This document outlines a protocol to address such path and session reliability for Proxy Mobile IPv6.</t>
