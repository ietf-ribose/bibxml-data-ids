      <t>In a distributed network environment such as a Proxy Mobile IPv6domain, it is often necessary to know that a peer is alive and, ifnot, detect quickly that a peer has failed and subsequently re-started. It is also necessary to detect failures where only a subsetof the existing mobility sessions are affected. Furthermore, failureindication should be possible without waiting for an explicit queryfrom a peer. This document outlines a protocol to address such pathand session reliability for Proxy Mobile IPv6.</t>
