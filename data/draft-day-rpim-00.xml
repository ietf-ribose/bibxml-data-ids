      <t>This document is an alternative approach to defining the requirementsfor a presence information protocol. It may be usefully compared andcontrasted with ''Presence Information Protocol Requirements'' by LisaDusseault, draft-dusseault-pipr-00.txt. Although worthy in manyrespects, that document includes numerous desiderata, designconsiderations, and implementation concerns. This document attemptsto define only requirements, and a minimal set of requirements atthat. In addition, this document treats ''presence'' and ''instantmessaging'' as distinct entities for the purpose of definingrequirements. We leave open the possibility of a single protocolfulfilling both sets of requirements, without requiring it.</t>
