      <t>This document is an alternative approach to defining the requirements for a presence information protocol. It may be usefully compared and contrasted with ''Presence Information Protocol Requirements'' by Lisa Dusseault, draft-dusseault-pipr-00.txt. Although worthy in many respects, that document includes numerous desiderata, design considerations, and implementation concerns. This document attempts to define only requirements, and a minimal set of requirements at that. In addition, this document treats ''presence'' and ''instant messaging'' as distinct entities for the purpose of defining requirements. We leave open the possibility of a single protocol fulfilling both sets of requirements, without requiring it.</t>
