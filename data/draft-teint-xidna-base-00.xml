      <t>Prior to Internationalised Domain Names in Applications (IDNA), therehas been no standard method for domains, names, addresses and similaridentifiers to use characters outside the ASCII repertoire. Thisstill applies to many identifiers that are no domain names, such asemail addresses (local-part), newsgroup names, etc.This document extends the mechanism defined in IDNA to otherprotocols and their identifiers. As with IDNA, these identifiers maybe drawn from a large repertoire (Unicode) and are mapped tobackward-compatible identifiers using only ASCII characters.For valid domain names, X-IDNA produces the same encoding as IDNA,even when these domain names are embedded in other addresses.</t>
