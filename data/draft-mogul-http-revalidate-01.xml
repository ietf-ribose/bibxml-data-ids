      <t>The HTTP/1.1 specification [1] currently defines a ``proxy-revalidate'' Cache-control directive, which forces a proxy to revalidate a stale response before using it in a reply. There is no mechanism defined that forces a proxy, but not an end-client, to revalidate a fresh response. The lack of such a mechanism is due to an error in drafting RFC2068, and appears to create problems for use of the Authorization header, the Digest Access Authentication extension [2], the State Management Mechanism [3], and several other proposed extensions. This document discusses the problem and several possible solutions, and proposes to add a new ``s-maxage'' directive as the best available solution.</t>
