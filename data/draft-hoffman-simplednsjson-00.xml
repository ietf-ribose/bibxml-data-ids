      <t>This document describes a JSON-based format for simple DNS queries and responses. In this case, "simple" means "only useful for getting A and AAAA records". This document also defines the application/ simpledns+json media type. The primary use case of this format is programs that do not want to take on the programmatic overhead needed to use messages in the application/dns-udpwireformat media type. [ This paragraph is to be removed when this document is published as an RFC ] Comments on this draft can be sent to the DNS over HTTP mailing list at https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/dnsoverhttp .</t>
