      <t>This memo describes IGAP, which allows user IP user clients and IP routers or network access servers to verify whether they can participate in a multicast group they hope and transport some information about it. IGAP is derived from IGMPv2, which can make users join a multicast group, who has the claim to participate a multicast group in a service. It's important for service providers to protect their revenue source.</t>
