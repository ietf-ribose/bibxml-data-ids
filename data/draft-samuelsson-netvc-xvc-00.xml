      <t>This document presents a high-level technical description of the xvc video codec. The xvc video codec is a novel video codec that was released in its first version in September 2017. This document provides some technical information as well as a discussion section around how the xvc codec meets the objectives of the NETVC Working Group. The document also includes results comparing a recent revision of xvc with recent revisions of AV1 and HM for three different test cases; All-Intra, single pass Random-Access, and multi-pass Random-Access. The average compression gain (BD-rate for PSNR-Y) for xvc ranges from 3% to 20% for the different test cases.</t>
