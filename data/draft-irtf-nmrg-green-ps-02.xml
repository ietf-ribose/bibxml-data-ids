      <t>Reducing humankind's environmental footprint and making technology more sustainable are among the biggest challenges of our age. Networks play an important part in this challenge. On one hand, they enable applications that help to reduce this footprint. On the other hand, they contribute to this footprint themselves in no insignificant way. Methods to make networking technology itself "greener" and to manage and operate networks in ways that reduces their environmental footprint without impacting their utility therefore need to be explored. This document outlines a corresponding set of opportunities, along with associated research challenges, for networking technology in general and management technology in particular to become "greener", i.e., more sustainable, with reduced greenhouse gas emissions and less negative impact on the environment.</t>
