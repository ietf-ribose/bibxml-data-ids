    <abstract>
      <t>The DTNRG research group has defined the experimental Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) [RFC5326] and the Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) [RFC6260] mechanism for the 'ipn' URI scheme. Finally, RFC5050 [RFC5050] defines values for the Bundle Administrative Record Type. All of these describe fields that are subject to a registry. For the purpose of its research work, the group has created ad-hoc registries. As the specifications are stable and have multiple interoperable implementations, the group would like to hand off the registries to IANA for official custody. This document describes the actions needed to be executed by IANA.</t>
