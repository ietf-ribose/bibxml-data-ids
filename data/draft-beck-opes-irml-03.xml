    <abstract>
      <t>The Intermediary Rule Markup Language (IRML) is an XML-based language that can be used to specify rules for the execution of Web services in general and OPES content services in particular. OPES services are a new class of applications running on network intermediaries, such as caches, proxies, gateways, etc. or dedicated (callout) servers. They are invoked through intermediaries acting on behalf of application endpoints. IRML is designed to serve as a simple and efficient, but yet powerful language to express the service execution policies of application endpoints. IRML rules are typically processed by intermediaries that trigger the execution of OPES services according to these rules and policies.</t>
