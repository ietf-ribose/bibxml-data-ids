      <t>This document describes the addition of three new attributes that are used by servers to support POSIX ACLs. The term POSIX ACLs refers to the ACL component of the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) 1003.1e draft 17 [IEEE] document for which sponsorship was withdrawn in January 1998. Although the draft POSIX standard that describes these ACLs was never ratified, several POSIX based operating systems, such as Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD include support for them. The NFS Version 4 (NFSv4) ACLs described in [RFC8881] henseforth referred to as NFSv4 ACLs, use a different model and attempts to map between the ACLs of these two models has not been completely successful. As such, this document proposes three new attributes that may optionally be used by an NFS Version 4, minor version 2 (NFSv4.2) server to support ACLs that conform the afor mentioned POSIX 1003.1e draft 17.</t>
