      <t>A typical requirement with any cryptographic key management system is to provide discovery, retrieval, distribution, and management of keys across entities needing to perform the necessary security operations. However there exists no standard mechanism to automatically discovery the keys, but rather the keys are either provisioned statically or shared beforehand via non standard mechanisms. This document defines machanisms for an entity to automatically discover the key(s) associated with other entities using the WebFinger protocol.</t>
