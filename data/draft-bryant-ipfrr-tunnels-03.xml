      <t>This draft describes an IP fast re-route mechanism that providesbackup connectivity in the event of a link or router failure. In theabsence of single points of failure and asymmetric costs, themechanism provides complete protection against any single failure.If perfect repair is not possible, the identity of all theunprotected links and routers is known in advance.This IP Fast Reroute advanced method was invented in 2002 and draft(draft-bryant-ipfrr-tunnels-00.txt) describing it was submitted tothe IETF in May 2004. It was one of the first methods of achievingfull repair coverage in an IP Network, and as such the draft has beenwidely referenced in the academic literature.The authors DO NOT propose that this IPFRR method be implementedsince better IPFRR advanced method capable of achieving full repaircoverage have subsequently been invented.</t>
