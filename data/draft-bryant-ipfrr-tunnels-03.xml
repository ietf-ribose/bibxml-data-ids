      <t>This draft describes an IP fast re-route mechanism that provides backup connectivity in the event of a link or router failure. In the absence of single points of failure and asymmetric costs, the mechanism provides complete protection against any single failure. If perfect repair is not possible, the identity of all the unprotected links and routers is known in advance. This IP Fast Reroute advanced method was invented in 2002 and draft (draft-bryant-ipfrr-tunnels-00.txt) describing it was submitted to the IETF in May 2004. It was one of the first methods of achieving full repair coverage in an IP Network, and as such the draft has been widely referenced in the academic literature. The authors DO NOT propose that this IPFRR method be implemented since better IPFRR advanced method capable of achieving full repair coverage have subsequently been invented.</t>
