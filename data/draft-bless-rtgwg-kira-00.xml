      <t>This document describes the Kademlia-directed ID-based Routing Architecture KIRA. KIRA offers highly scalable zero-touch IPv6 connectivity, i.e., it can connect hundred thousands of routers and devices in a single network (without requiring any form of hierarchy like areas). It is self-organizing to achieve a zero-touch solution that provides resilient (control plane) IPv6 connectivity without requiring any manual configuration by operators. It works well in various topologies and is loop-free even during convergence. The architecture consists of the ID-based network layer routing protocol RÂ²/Kad in its routing tier and a Path-ID-based forwarding tier. The topological independent IDs can be embedded into IPv6 addresses, so that KIRA provides zero-touch IPv6 connectivity between KIRA nodes.</t>
