      <t>Routing protocols that have been designed to run within a singleadministrative domain ("IGPs") generally do so by assigning a metricto each link, and then choosing as the installed path between twonodes the path for which the total distance (sum of the metric ofeach link along the path) is minimized. BGP, designed to providerouting over a large number of independent administrative domains("autonomous systems"), does not make its path selection decisionsthrough the use of a metric. It is generally recognized that anyattempt to do so would incur significant scalability problems, aswell as inter-administration coordination problems. However, thereare deployments in which a single administration runs severalcontiguous BGP networks. In such cases, it can be desirable, withinthat single administrative domain, for BGP to select paths based on ametric, just as an IGP would do. The purpose of this document is toprovide a specification for doing so.</t>
