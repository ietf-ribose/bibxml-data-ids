      <t>Facsimile (Fax) has a long tradition of being a telephony applicationfrom one terminal device to another, where the terminal deviceconsists of a paper input device (scanner), a paper output device(printer), and a limited amount of processing power. The transmissionof data end-to-end is accompanied by negotiation (to ensure that thescanned data can be rendered at the recipient) and confirmation ofdelivery (to give the sender assurance that the final data has beenreceived and processed.) Over time, facsimile has been extended toallow for PCs connected running software to send and receive fax, tosend data other than paper images, as well as many extensions to thebasic image model, e.g., recent ITU fax standards for color fax.Other delivery extensions have included sub-addressing (additionalsignals after the call is established to facilitate automated routingof faxes to desktops or mailboxes), and enhanced features such asfax-back, polling, and even the transfer of binary files. Many mechanisms for sending fax documents over the Internet have beendemonstrated and deployed and are currently in use. This document summarizes the requirements for Internet Fax asdiscussed in the IETF Internet Fax working group. It is an attempt toestablish a baseline of agreed-to requirements against which anyproposal for Internet Fax can be judged. This document encompasses therequirements for both 'real-time' fax as well as 'store and forward'fax (both terms defined in Section 2).</t>
