      <t>This document introduces two schemes that provide a per-packetauthentication and integrity service in the context of the ALC andNORM protocols. The first scheme is based on digital signatures.Because it relies on asymmetric cryptography, this scheme generates ahigh processing load at the sender and to a lesser extent at areceiver, as well as a significant transmission overhead. It istherefore well suited to low data rate sessions. The second schemerelies on a group Message Authentication Code (MAC). Because thisscheme relies symmetric cryptography, MAC calculation andverification are fast operations, which makes it suited to high datarate sessions. However it only provides a group authentication andintegrity service, which means that it only protects againstattackers that are not group members.</t>
