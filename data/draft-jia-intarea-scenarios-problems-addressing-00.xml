    <abstract>
      <t>The Internet Protocol (IP) has been the major technological success in information technology of the last half century. As Internet become pervasive, IP start replacing communication technology for domain-specific solutions. However, domains with specific requirements as well as communication behaviors and semantics still exists and represent what [RFC8799] recognizes as "limited domains". When communicating within limited domains, the address semantic and format may differ with respect to the IP address one. As such, there is a need to adapt the domain-specific addressing to the Internet addressing paradigm. In certain scenarios, such adaptation may raise challenges. This document describes well-recognized scenarios that showcase possibly different addressing requirements which are challenging to be accommodated in the IP addressing model. These scenarios highlight issues related to the Internet addressing model and call for starting a discussion on a way to re-think/evolve the addressing model so to better accommodate different domain-specific requirements.</t>
