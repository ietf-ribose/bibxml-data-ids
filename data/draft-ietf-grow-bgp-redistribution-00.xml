      <t>This document proposes the redistribution extended community. Thisnew extended community allows a router to influence how a specificroute should be redistributed towards a specified set of eBGPspeakers. Several types of redistribution communities are proposed.The first type may be used to indicate that a specific route shouldnot be announced over a specified set of eBGP sessions. The secondtype may be used to indicate that the attached route should only beannounced with the NO_EXPORT community over the specified set of eBGPsessions and the third type may be used to indicate that the attachedroute should be prepended n times when announced over a specified setof eBGP sessions.</t>
