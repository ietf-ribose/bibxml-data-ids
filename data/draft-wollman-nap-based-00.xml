      <t>This document describes NAP-based addressing, a scheme for abstracting and encoding hierarchical addresses in a name service in such a way as to allow the entities responsible for various levels in an address to change their portions independently and scaleably. As a byproduct, it also defines a particular addressing scheme which the author believes to be appropriate for the existing model of Internet connectivity.</t>
