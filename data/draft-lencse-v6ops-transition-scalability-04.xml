    <abstract>
      <t>Several IPv6 transition technologies have been developed to provide customers with IPv4-as-a-Service (IPv4aaS) for ISPs with an IPv6-only access and/or core network. All these technologies have their advantages and disadvantages, and depending on existing topology, skills, strategy and other preferences, one of these technologies may be the most appropriate solution for a network operator. This document examines the scalability of the five most prominent IPv4aaS technologies (464XLAT, Dual Stack Lite, Lightweight 4over6, MAP-E, MAP-T) considering two aspects: (1) how their performance scales up with the number of CPU cores, (2) how their performance degrades, when the number of concurrent sessions is increased until hardware limit is reached.</t>
