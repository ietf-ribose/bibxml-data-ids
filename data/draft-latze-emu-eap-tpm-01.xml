      <t>This document describes an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [RFC3748] method for identity distribution, authentication and session key distribution using the Trusted Computing Group's (TCG) Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The TPM has been defined by the TCG in order to establish a root of trust and measurements in (consumer) computers. It provides several cryptographic functions and a secure storage for keys and hashes. There is also a TPM specification for mobile devices called Mobile Trusted Module (MTM), which can also be used for EAP-TPM. This new EAP method allows network authentication, which also supports user anonymity, the usage of different user identities for the authentication with different network operators, result indication, and a fast re-authentication.</t>
