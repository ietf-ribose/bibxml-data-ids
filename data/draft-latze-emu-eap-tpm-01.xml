      <t>This document describes an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)[RFC3748] method for identity distribution, authentication andsession key distribution using the Trusted Computing Group's (TCG)Trusted Platform Module (TPM). The TPM has been defined by the TCGin order to establish a root of trust and measurements in (consumer)computers. It provides several cryptographic functions and a securestorage for keys and hashes. There is also a TPM specification formobile devices called Mobile Trusted Module (MTM), which can also beused for EAP-TPM. This new EAP method allows network authentication,which also supports user anonymity, the usage of different useridentities for the authentication with different network operators,result indication, and a fast re-authentication.</t>
