      <t>IPv4 migrating to IPv6 is a network layer issue, it is not easy tomandate the application in the host to change in the first place, thenetwork layer may have to have a solution to support conventionalIPv4 appliations in the IPv6 only network, especially when there aremultiple applications need to be supported. This document describesa mechanism for providing a host-based IPv6 translation technologywhich could guarantee IPv4 application backward compatibility. A newwell known IPv6 prefix is used for the destination addresstranslation and network assigned prefix will be used for sourceaddress translation.</t>
