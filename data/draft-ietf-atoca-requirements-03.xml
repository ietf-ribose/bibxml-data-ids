      <t>Before, during and after emergency situations various agencies need to provide information to a group of persons or to the public within a geographical area. While many aspects of such systems are specific to national or local jurisdictions, emergencies span such boundaries and notifications need to reach visitors from other jurisdictions. This document provides terminology, requirements and an architectural description for protocols exchanging alerts between IP-based end points.</t>
