    <abstract>
      <t>Used in a Massive Data Center (MDC), BGP-LS and BGP-SPF need link neighbor discovery, liveness, and addressability data. Link State Over Ethernet protocols provide link discovery, exchange AFI/SAFIs, and discover addresses over raw Ethernet. These data are pushed directly to BGP-LS/SPF, obviating the need for centralized controller architectures. This protocol is more widely applicable, and has been designed to support a wide range of routing and similar protocols which need link discovery and characterisation.</t>
