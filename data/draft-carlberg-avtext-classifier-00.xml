      <t>This document defines a new RTP header extension. The purpose of the extension is to provide additional information that further distinguishes the RTP datagram (and its payload) from other datagrams containing the same type of payload. The information may be used by application layer gateways to drop packets, or place them in a lower priority outbound queue. Or, through deep packet inspection, information stored in the classifier header extension may be used to (re)set diff-serv code points set in the IP header that may be have reset at ingress/egress boundaries of a diff-serv domain.</t>
