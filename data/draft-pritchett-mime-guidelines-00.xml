      <t>The introduction of MIME brings the standards required to construct robust mail user agents. These agents will quite often have presentation semantics. In many cases, the way to present a multipart message is clear based on the message, but there are times when this is not true. This document proposes a mechanism for dealing with those cases.</t>
