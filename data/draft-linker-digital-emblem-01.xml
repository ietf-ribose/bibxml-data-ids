    <abstract>
      <t>In times of armed conflict, the protective emblems of the red cross, red crescent, and red crystal are used to mark _physical_ assets. This enables military units to identify assets as respected and protected under international humanitarian law. This draft explores how one could apply the protective emblems to _digital_, network- connected infrastructure using a _digital emblem_, and defines the requirements of a digital emblem, emphasizing security requirements. Notably, a digital emblem has a unique combination of security requirements, namely, authentication, accountability, and a property that we call _covert inspection_. Covert inspection means that those wishing to authenticate assets as protected must be able to do so without revealing that they may attack unprotected entities.</t>
