      <t>THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL SUBMISSION PROPOSING A CHANGE TO draft-ietf- sip-refer. IT IS FOR DISCUSSION ONLY. This document defines the REFER method. This SIP extension requests that the recipient REFER to a resource provided in the request. It provides a mechanism allowing the party sending the REFER to be notified of the outcome of the referenced request. This can be used to enable many applications, including call transfer. In addition to the REFER method, this document defines the referevent option tag, the refer event package, and the Refer-To request header.</t>
