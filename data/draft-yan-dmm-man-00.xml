    <abstract>
      <t>Based on IPv6, multiple mobility management protocols have been developed and generally they can be classified into two types: network-based and host-based. Different protocols have different functional requirements on the network element or the terminal and then a scheme should be used in order to support the negotiation and selection of adopted mobility management protocol when a terminal accesses to a new network. In this draft, this issue is considered and analyzed.</t>
