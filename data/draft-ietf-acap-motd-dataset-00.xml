      <t>The Application Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP] is designed to support remote storage and access of common application option, configuration and preference information. Once such piece of information is the 'Message of the Day' greeting, used by system administrators to communicate important information to all users when they begin to use a system. This document describes a common format for storing MOTD information in ACAP, how site administrators may configure their ACAP MOTD service to allow multiple groups within the site to provide custom MOTD information, and how a client should access and use this information.</t>
