    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides environment security requirements for the SFC architecture. Environment security requirements are independent of the protocols used for SFC - such as NSH for example. As a result, the requirements provided in this document are intended to provide good security practices so SFC can be securely deployed and operated. These security requirements are designated as environment security requirements as opposed to the protocol security requirements.</t>
