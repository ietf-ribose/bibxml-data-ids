    <abstract>
      <t>Since services delivered from cloud need delicate coordination among the client, network and cloud, this draft defines a new Segment to provide service routing and addressing functions by leveraging SRv6 Segment programming capabilities. With Computing Segments proposed, the network gains its capability to identify and process SAN header in need and a complete service routing procedure can be achieved.</t>
