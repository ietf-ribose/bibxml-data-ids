    <abstract>
      <t>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) provide numerous benefits: reduced delivery cost for cacheable content, improved quality of experience for End Users and increased robustness of delivery. For these reasons they are frequently used for large-scale content delivery. As a result, existing CDN providers are scaling up their infrastructure and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are deploying their own CDNs. It is generally desirable that a given content item can be delivered to an end user regardless of that end user's location or attachment network. This creates a requirement for interconnecting standalone CDNs so they can interoperate as an open content delivery infrastructure for the end-to-end delivery of content from Content Service Providers (CSPs) to end users. However, no standards or open specifications currently exist to facilitate such CDN interconnection. The goal of this document is to outline the problem area for the IETF with a view towards creating a working group. This working group would work on interoperable and scalable solutions for CDN interconnection.</t>
