      <t>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) provide numerous benefits: reduceddelivery cost for cacheable content, improved quality of experiencefor End Users and increased robustness of delivery. For thesereasons they are frequently used for large-scale content delivery.As a result, existing CDN providers are scaling up theirinfrastructure and many Network Service Providers (NSPs) aredeploying their own CDNs. It is generally desirable that a givencontent item can be delivered to an end user regardless of that enduser's location or attachment network. This creates a requirementfor interconnecting standalone CDNs so they can interoperate as anopen content delivery infrastructure for the end-to-end delivery ofcontent from Content Service Providers (CSPs) to end users. However,no standards or open specifications currently exist to facilitatesuch CDN interconnection.The goal of this document is to outline the problem area for the IETFwith a view towards creating a working group. This working groupwould work on interoperable and scalable solutions for CDNinterconnection.</t>
