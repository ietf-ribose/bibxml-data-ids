      <t>When a Diameter server or agent becomes overloaded, it needs to be able to gracefully reduce its load, typically by informing clients to reduce or stop sending traffic for some period of time. Otherwise, it must continue to expend resources parsing and responding to Diameter messages. This document proposes a concrete, application-independent mechanism to address the challenge of communicating load and overload state among Diameter peers, and specifies an algorithm for load abatement to address such overload conditions as they occur. The load abatement algorithm is extensible, allowing for future documents to define additional load abatement approaches.</t>
