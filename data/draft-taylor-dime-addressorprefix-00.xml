      <t>Section 4.3.1 of the Diameter base specification [RFC6733] defines a number of derived AVP data formats. This collection includes the Address format, which is suitable for encoding complete addresses. In some potential applications, however, there is a requirement to encode a prefix rather than a complete address. This document defines the AddressOrPrefix derived AVP data format, modelled after the Address format defined in [RFC6733], but allowing the same AVP to represent a prefix of any length up to a full address. This document updates RFC 6733.</t>
