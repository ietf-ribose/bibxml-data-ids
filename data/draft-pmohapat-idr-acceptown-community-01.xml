    <abstract>
      <t>It may be useful for a BGP speaker in an autonomous system to receive and accept its own advertised route from a route reflector with more fine-grained route control. For example, the route reflector can change certain attributes of a route as desired, and then re- advertise it back to the originator. Though it is possible to perform such policy control directly at the originator, it may be operationally cumbersome in a network with a large number of border routers having complex BGP policies. This draft defines a new and well-known BGP community value, ACCEPT_OWN, that signals a BGP speaker to accept an UPDATE message and process the associated routes even when the ORIGINATOR_ID or the NEXT_HOP matches that of the receiving speaker.</t>
