      <t>Efficient techniques for rapid restoration must be addressed within GMPLS. This document describes extensions to RSVP-TE signaling in support of shared mesh restoration. Shared mesh restoration describes restoration plans in which restoration capacity is shared across multiple independent failures. In particular, this document proposes extensions enabling reservation of restoration capacity, LSP restoration, LSP reversion and LSP deletion.</t>
