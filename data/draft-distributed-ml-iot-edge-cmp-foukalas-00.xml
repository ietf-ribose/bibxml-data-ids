      <t>Next generation Internet requires decentralized and distributedintelligence in order to make available a new type ofexperience to serve the user's interests. Such new serviceswill be enabled by deploying the intelligenceover a high volume of IoT devices in a form of distributedprotocol. Such a protocol will orchestrate the machine learning(ML) application in order to train the aggregated data availablefrom the IoT devices. The training is not an easy task in sucha distributed environment, where the amount of connected IoTdevices will scale up and the needs for both interoperabilityand computing are high. This draft, addresses both issuesby combining two emerging technologies known as edge AIand fog computing. The protocol procedures aggregate the datacollected by the IoT devices into a fog node and apply edge AIfor data analysis at the edge of the infrastructure. Theanalysis of the IoT requirements resulted in an end-to-end MLprotocol specification which is presented throughout this draft.</t>
