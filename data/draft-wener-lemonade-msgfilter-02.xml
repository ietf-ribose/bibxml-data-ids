      <t>In a mobile environment it is often desirable to allow a user to restrict or constrain the set of messages that will be sent to the mobile device. There may be several reasons. The user may not want to pay for the bandwidth consumed, they may not want to to consume memory on the phone or they may just want to restrict what they get "bothered" by while in a mobile environment. This draft defines a way to allow the user to restrict message sets per folder.</t>
