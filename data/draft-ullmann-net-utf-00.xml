      <t>The Internet is no longer a creature of the United States, much less of DARPA (the US Defence Advance Research Projects Agency). It is now an international network, and the ability to communicate in any of the world languages on an equal footing is an imperative. This draft attempts to track the development of ISO 10646, a moving target at this writing. The reference citation below is to the 2nd 10646 draft, for which balloting has just concluded. (June 1992). It is therefore expected that this memo will potentially change until the publication of IS 10646.
