      <t>Virtual machines, or virtualized servers, basically allow onephysical server to support multiple hosts (20, 30, or hundreds of).As virtual machines are introduced to Data center, the number ofhosts within one data center can grow dramatically, which couldcreate tremendous impact to networks and hosts.This document describes reasons why it is still desirable to havevirtual machines in Data Center to be in one Layer 2 network andpotential problems this type of Layer 2 network will face. The goalis to justify why it is necessary for IETF to create a working groupto work on interoperable and scalable solutions for data center(s)with large number of virtual machines.</t>
