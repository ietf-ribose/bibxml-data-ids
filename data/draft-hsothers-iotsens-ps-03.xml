    <abstract>
      <t>In framework of future 6G the need for easy and secure connectivity between a great amount of small devices as sensors and household appliances will be essential. Such massive Internet of Things (mIoT) requires authentication methods which are reliable also in case of vulnerable wireless links and work for simple cheap (dumb) devices. Aim of this document is to lay ground for the need for new authentication models and admission methods in the framework of devices (e.g., machines in IoT communication) within a (wireless or wireline-based) network. Simple devices may only have a minimum amount of physical interfaces available. As an example for establishing an out-of-band channel for exchange of authentication material radio sensing technology may serve. This is currently under investigation for Wireless LAN and upcoming cellular radio at both IEEE and 3GPP.</t>
