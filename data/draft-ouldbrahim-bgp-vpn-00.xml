    <abstract>
      <t>VPN information can be piggybacked into BGP to allow a network-based VPN to auto-discover its membership and adequate information needed before any data exchange between private sites takes place across the backbone. Other drafts (e.g.[VPN-RFC2547]) also piggyback VPN information onto the backbone instance of BGP. However, [VPN- RFC2547] implicitly allows only for a single reachability mechanism (also BGP piggybacking) and a single tunneling mechanism (MPLS). This draft allows for the explicit indication of the reachability modes supported (e.g. piggybacking or virtual router) and the tunneling mechanisms supported, by a VPN device. The purpose of this draft is to define a common VPN information protocol that can be used for both piggybacking and virtual router schemes. It allows for the auto-discovery of the nodes in a particular VPN, the selection of the reachability mechanism to use, and the selection of the tunneling protocol to use.</t>
