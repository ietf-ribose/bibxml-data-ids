      <t>VPN information can be piggybacked into BGP to allow a network-basedVPN to auto-discover its membership and adequate information neededbefore any data exchange between private sites takes place acrossthe backbone. Other drafts (e.g.[VPN-RFC2547]) also piggyback VPNinformation onto the backbone instance of BGP. However, [VPN-RFC2547] implicitly allows only for a single reachability mechanism(also BGP piggybacking) and a single tunneling mechanism (MPLS).This draft allows for the explicit indication of the reachabilitymodes supported (e.g. piggybacking or virtual router) and thetunneling mechanisms supported, by a VPN device. The purpose of thisdraft is to define a common VPN information protocol that can beused for both piggybacking and virtual router schemes. It allows forthe auto-discovery of the nodes in a particular VPN, the selectionof the reachability mechanism to use, and the selection of thetunneling protocol to use.</t>
