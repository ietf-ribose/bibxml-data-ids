      <t>This document specifies an information retrieval protocol for digital library. This protocol has two parts: standard search Webservice, which defines the format of query words and the search results; a method to find and select such search Webservice. By using this protocol, all the databases including web page database, digital issue database, and video database, can release the uniform search Webservice, though these databases may have different metadata standards and architectures. And these Webservice can be easily found and visited by search systems. This very protocol makes it possible that users can obtain all kinds of information on the Internet in single search engine, but not visit lots of different search engines one by one.</t>
