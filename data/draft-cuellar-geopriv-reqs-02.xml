    <abstract>
      <t>Location-based services, navigation applications, emergency services, management of equipment in the field, and other location-dependent services need geographic location information about a target (user, resource or other entity). There is a need to securely gather and transfer location information for location services, protecting the privacy of the individuals involved. This document describes the requirements for the geopriv Location Object (used to transfer location data and perhaps some other information) and for further IETF protocols that use this Location Object as an embedded protocol. We focus on authorization, integrity and privacy requirements.</t>
