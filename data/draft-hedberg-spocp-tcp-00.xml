      <t>The SPOCP protocol has been described in [SPOCP]. The description is done in general terms and is not done in such a way that implementers can directly implement the protocol. To make that possible there has to be a mapping defined between the more abstract description and a bits on the wire description. This document represents one possible mapping.</t>
