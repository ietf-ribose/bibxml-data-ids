    <abstract>
      <t>It has been observed that the current IETF standard designations, STD nnnn and BCP nnnn designation, have not worked well. Problems have been found when one of them is used either as a stable reference for external specifications or as a combined reference for multiple documents linked together into a single document. This document proposes two changes to these designations. The first of these changes would create a new document series and assign a new number and acronym to a specification when it enters the first level of the Standards Track (or is first designated as a BCP). The second would migrate the concept of STDs and BCPs numbering of RFCs into actual documents that detail what they identify, their publication information and their change history. The document also specifies a set of minor standards process changes to accommodate and integrate the new style of doing things that is represented by the new document series.</t>
