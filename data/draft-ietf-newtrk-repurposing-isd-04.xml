      <t>It has been observed that the current IETF standard designations, STDnnnn and BCP nnnn designation, have not worked well. Problems havebeen found when one of them is used either as a stable reference forexternal specifications or as a combined reference for multipledocuments linked together into a single document. This documentproposes two changes to these designations. The first of thesechanges would create a new document series and assign a new numberand acronym to a specification when it enters the first level of theStandards Track (or is first designated as a BCP). The second wouldmigrate the concept of STDs and BCPs numbering of RFCs into actualdocuments that detail what they identify, their publicationinformation and their change history. The document also specifies aset of minor standards process changes to accommodate and integratethe new style of doing things that is represented by the new documentseries.</t>
