      <t>The IESG returned the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) draft to the working groupdue to concerns about the security and scalability of binding updates(BUs) sent to correspondent nodes and the associated IPsec processingthat is specified in the draft. Since that time discussions havecontinued to attempt to define what is really needed to make bindingupdates secure while taking into consideration the aspect ofscalability as well as the fact that IPsec may not be the mostsuitable security mechanism for securing BUs between MNs and CNs.</t>
