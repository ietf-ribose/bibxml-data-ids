      <t>The IESG returned the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) draft to the working group due to concerns about the security and scalability of binding updates (BUs) sent to correspondent nodes and the associated IPsec processing that is specified in the draft. Since that time discussions have continued to attempt to define what is really needed to make binding updates secure while taking into consideration the aspect of scalability as well as the fact that IPsec may not be the most suitable security mechanism for securing BUs between MNs and CNs.</t>
