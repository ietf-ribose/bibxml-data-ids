      <t>The practice and need for active network measurement is wellestablished, however current tools are not well suited to thistask, mostly because the protocols which they employ have notbeen designed for measurement of the modern Internet.The IP Measurement Protocol (IPMP) is based on packet-probes, andis designed to allow routers to participate in measurements by theinsertion of path information as the probe passes between a pair ofhosts. IPMP is tightly constrained and easy to implement.</t>
