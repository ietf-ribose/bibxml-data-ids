      <t>Networks that use SIP to start and stop sessions between their userswill frequently be upgraded with software and hardware changes.Users will similarly frequently change their client software and theway they use the network. In order to allow troubleshooting andregression testing, it is useful to provide debugging as part of thenetwork fabric. This draft describes a SIP private header thattriggers logging of SIP signalling and identifies logs at mulitipleSIP entities as belonging to a single end-to-end session.</t>
