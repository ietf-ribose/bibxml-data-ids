      <t>Networks that use SIP to start and stop sessions between their users will frequently be upgraded with software and hardware changes. Users will similarly frequently change their client software and the way they use the network. In order to allow troubleshooting and regression testing, it is useful to provide debugging as part of the network fabric. This draft describes a SIP private header that triggers logging of SIP signalling and identifies logs at mulitiple SIP entities as belonging to a single end-to-end session.</t>
