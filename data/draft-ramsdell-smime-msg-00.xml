      <t>S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) provides aconsistent way to send and receive secure MIME data. Based on thepopular Internet MIME standard, S/MIME provides the followingcryptographic security services for electronic messaging applications:authentication, message integrity and non-repudiation of origin (usingdigital signatures) and privacy and data security (using encryption). S/MIME can be used by traditional mail user agents (MUAs) to addcryptographic security services to mail that is sent, and to interpretcryptographic security services in mail that is received. However,S/MIME is not restricted to mail; it can be used with any transportmechanism that transports MIME data, such as HTTP. As such, S/MIMEtakes advantage of the object-based features of MIME and allows securemessages to be exchanged in mixed-transport systems. Further, S/MIME can be used in automated message transfer agents thatuse cryptographic security services that do not require any humanintervention, such as the signing of software-generated documents andthe encryption of FAX messages sent over the Internet.</t>
