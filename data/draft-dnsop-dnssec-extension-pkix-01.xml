    <abstract>
      <t>The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were standardized a couple of decades ago but it has not been widely deployed. Thus, a vast majority of DNS messages in the real world are still vulnerable to various kinds of integrity attacks like cache poisoning attacks. This document describes a mechanism that extends the current DNSSEC protocol in such a way that guarantees the integrity of DNS messages using PKIX certificates without any dependencies on other entities in the DNS infrastructure.</t>
