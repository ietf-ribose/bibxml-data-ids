      <t>Often, multiple IMAP clients need to coordinate changes to a commonIMAP mailbox. Examples include different clients for the same user,and multiple users accessing shared mailboxes. These clientsneed a mechanism to synchronize state changes for messages within themailbox. They must be able to guarantee that only one client can changemessage state (e.g., message flags or annotations) at any time. Anexample of such an application is use of an IMAP mailbox as a messagequeue with multiple dequeueing clients.The Conditional Store facility provides a protected update mechanism formessage state information that can detect and resolve conflicts betweenmultiple writers.</t>
