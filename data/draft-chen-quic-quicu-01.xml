    <abstract>
      <t>QUIC Unreliable (QUICU) is an extension of the QUIC protocol for unreliable data transmission, mainly through the definition and use of three new types of frames, namely the Expire Offset Frame, Boundary Frame, and Correlation Frame. The main purpose of this extension is to reduce data delivery delay. Through controlling the timing and scope of packet losses, QUICU reduces useless transmission to improve transmission efficiency, reduces head-of-line blocking to improve transmission timeliness, which are beneficial to delay- sensitive applications, especially audio and video applications. This document describes the motivation, the operations, and the wire formats of the three new types of frames.</t>
