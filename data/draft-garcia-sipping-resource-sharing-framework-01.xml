      <t>This memo proposes a SIP framework used for advertising and searching for shared resources, such as services or files, within a given community. The memo defines the signaling used by users to signal the availability of resources stored in their User Agents (UA). It also provides the signaling for users to perform searches of available resources and monitor changes in existing resources. Additionally, we provide the signaling used to access a resource. These methods can be used in (but are not limited to) SIP peer-to- peer systems based on centralized, semi-centralized or fully distributed architectures.</t>
