      <t>There are 3 major functions that must be performed to achievemulticast Label Switching. 1) Label Allocation, which requires eachmulticast Label Switching Router (LSR) to have a label value rangethat it uses. 2) Label Binding, using the labels allocated, a LSRmust assign them to multicast routes. 3) Label Binding Distribution,after binding label values to routes, they must be distributed toother LSRs so they all forward on a common and consistentdistribution tree.In this document we present how labels are allocated uniquely across multicast capable LSRs on a LAN and point-to-point IP subnets.</t>
