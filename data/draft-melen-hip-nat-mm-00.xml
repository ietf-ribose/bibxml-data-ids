      <t>This document defines extensions for HIP mobility and multihomingmechanisms to operate in network environments with NAT devices. Theextensions are based on the ICE protocol that allows twocommunicating end-hosts to establish a direct communications pathwith each other even when residing in separate private addressrealms. The focus of the extensions in this document is on fault-tolerance with symmetric locator pairs, and load-balancing is alsodiscussed. This document also updates RFC5206.</t>
