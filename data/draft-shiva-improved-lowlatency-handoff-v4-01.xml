      <t>We are considering the IETF Mobile IP WG proposed Low Latency Handoffdraft[2] in the different network scenerios and suggesting one simplersolution with low loss, reduced number of timers, reduced network overhead, along with the low latency. One more achievement will be reduction in the dependency on exact L2 trigger timing and Pre-Registration timer expiration in Combined Handoff method[2].</t>
