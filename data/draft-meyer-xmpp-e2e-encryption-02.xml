      <t>This document specifies "XTLS", a protocol for end-to-end encryptionof Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) traffic. XTLSis an application-level usage of Transport Layer Security (TLS) thatis set up using the XMPP Jingle extension for session negotiation andtransported using any streaming transport as the data deliverymechanism. Thus XTLS treats the end-to-end exchange of XML stanzasas a virtual transport and uses TLS to secure that transport,enabling XMPP entities to communicate in a way that is designed toensure the confidentiality and integrity XML stanzas. The protocolcan be used for secure end-to-end messaging as well as other XMPPapplications, such as file transfer.</t>
