    <abstract>
      <t>[RFC7854] and [RFC8671] define Pre-Policy Adj-RIB-In, Post-Policy Adj-RIB-In, Pre-Policy Adj-RIB-Out and Post-Policy Adj-RIB-Out Route- Monitoring messages. A route unmodified by the inbound policy is included both in Pre-Policy Adj-RIB-In as well as Post-Policy Adj- RIB-In Route-Monitoring messages when both the Pre-Policy and Post- Policy Route-Monitoring modes are enabled. Similarly, a route unmodified by the outbound policy is included in Pre-Policy Adj-RIB- Out as well as Post-Policy Adj-RIB-Out Route-Monitoring messages. To avoid duplicate inclusion of routes unmodified by policy either in Adj-RIB-In or Adj-RIB-Out this document defines two methods.</t>
