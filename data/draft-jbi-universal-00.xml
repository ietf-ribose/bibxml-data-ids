      <t>IPv6 transition is becoming an important research topic recently. In traditional architecture, transition mechanisms are closely connected with application, protocol stack, and network equipments. This makes the transition process very complicated, and increases the difficulty of network management. In this document, we present a new network architecture called Univer6. It uses IPv6 as a unified middle layer,thus can adapt to various kinds of applications and network equipments. Univer6 will help provide a smooth transition towards IPv6, simplify network management process, and accelerate the development of IPv6.</t>
