      <t>This document describes an alternative way of providing Internet addressing and access. The addressing scheme builds on the idea of an 'IP Network Address Translator (NAT) [1], and relies on the Internet Service Provider's, gateway systems (hosts/routers) providing dynamic address translation from a pool of IP addresses. The access scheme splits each country/region into areas that are covered by local service providers who provide a Point of Presence (PoP) to the Internet. The areas will be defined by grouping together telephone area dial codes. Each area would be allocated to a service provider in much the same way as an independent radio station is licensed to use a given frequency. The dial-up users will gain access to their local service providers' PoP by calling a national 'local' number. The PTT's will direct all the calls to the service provider that has the concession for the users' area. Overall it is hoped that the proposals within this memo will act as a catalyst towards resolving the IP addressing problems and provide a foundation towards improving and rationalising dial-up access to the Internet.</t>
