      <t>In mobile backhaul network, traditional configuration and diagnoses mechanisms base on device-level management tools and manual processing are ill-suited to meet the requirements of today's scalable, flexible, and complex network. Thanks to the new innovation of Interface to the Routing System's (I2RS) programmatic interfaces, as defined in [I-D.ward-i2rs-framework], an alternative way has been rolled out to control the configuration and diagnose the operation results. This document discusses the use case of I2RS in mobile backhaul network.</t>
