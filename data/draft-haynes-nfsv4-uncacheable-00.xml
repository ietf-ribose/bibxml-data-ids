      <t>The Network File System v4.2 (NFSv4.2) allows a client to cache directory entries (dirents) for files. By caching dirents, the client avoids querying the server to refresh information. One issue with this caching is that under Access Based Enumeration, the client can not determine if the user has permission to view the dirent's attributes. We introduce a new file attribute called uncacheable which indicates that the client MUST NOT cache the attributes for that dirent. This document extends NFSv4.2 (see RFC7863).</t>
