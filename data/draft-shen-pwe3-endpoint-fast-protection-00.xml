      <t>This document specifies a mechanism for protecting pseudowires (PW) against egress attachment circuit (AC) failure and egress PE failure. Designed on the basis of multi-homed CE, upstream label assignment and context specific label switching, the mechanism enables local repair to be performed immediately upon a failure. In particular, the router at point of local repair (PLR) can redirect PW traffic to a protector PE via a bypass LSP in the order of tens of milliseconds, achieving fast protection that is comparable to MPLS fast reroute.</t>
