    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes several use cases of Intent-Based Networking (IBN) and the methodologies to differ each use case by following the lifecycle of a real IBN system. It includes the initial system awareness and data collection for the IBN system and the construction of the IBN system, which consists of intent translation, deployment, verification, evaluation, and optimization. Practice learning and general learning are also summarized to instruct the construction of next generation network management systems with the integration of IBN techniques. Finally, this document discusses three aspects for the deployment of IBN systems on the real world. They are Multi- Domain Deployment, Network Digital Twin, and IBN with Artificial Intelligence (AI).</t>
