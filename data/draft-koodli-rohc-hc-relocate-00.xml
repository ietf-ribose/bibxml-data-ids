      <t>In networks with limited bandwidths, such as wireless cellularnetworks, compression of IP and transport headers may be employed toobtain better utilization of the available spectrum capacity. Whenheader compression is used along with handoffs in such networks,the header compression context needs to be relocated from one IPaccess point (i.e., a router) to another in order to achieve seamlessoperation. In this document, we propose a mechanism to achieve thiscompression context relocation using IPv6 and Mobile IPv6.</t>
