      <t>In networks with limited bandwidths, such as wireless cellular networks, compression of IP and transport headers may be employed to obtain better utilization of the available spectrum capacity. When header compression is used along with handoffs in such networks, the header compression context needs to be relocated from one IP access point (i.e., a router) to another in order to achieve seamless operation. In this document, we propose a mechanism to achieve this compression context relocation using IPv6 and Mobile IPv6.</t>
