      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) supports the initiation,modification, and termination of media sessions between user agents.These sessions are managed by SIP dialogs, which represent a SIPrelationship between a pair of user agents. Because dialogs arebetween pairs of user agents, SIP's usage for two-partycommunications (such as a phone call), is obvious. Communicationssessions with multiple participants, generally known as conferencing,are more complicated. This document defines a framework for how suchconferencing can occur. This framework describes the overallarchitecture, terminology, and protocol components needed for multi-party conferencing.</t>
