      <t>This document works to harmonize the vCard directory information card and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) standards by extending both standards to support a common directory card entity. Additional LDAP attributes and object classes, and additional properties for vCard are defined. A standard mapping process between the two designed to support vCard's goal of being a transport format between directories (not just LDAP) is defined.</t>
