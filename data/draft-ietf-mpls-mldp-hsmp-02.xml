      <t>This draft introduces a hub &amp; spoke multipoint LSP (or HSMP LSP for short), which allows traffic both from root to leaf through P2MP LSP and also leaf to root along the co-routed reverse path. That means traffic entering the HSMP LSP from application/customer at the root node travels downstream to each leaf node, exactly as if it is travelling downstream along a P2MP LSP to each leaf node. Upstream traffic entering the HSMP LSP at any leaf node travels upstream along the tree to the root, as if it is unicast to the root, and strictly follows the downstream path of the tree rather than routing protocol based unicast path to the root.</t>
