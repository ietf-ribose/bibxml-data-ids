      <t>This draft describes a profile for compressing RTP/UDP/IP using theEfficient Protocol Independent Compression (EPIC) [2] scheme.The RObust Header Compression [1] scheme is designed to compresspacket headers over error prone channels. It is built around anextensible core framework that can be tailored to compress newprotocol stacks by adding additional ROHC profiles.This profile gives behaviours similar to (a subset of) thefunctionality of [1] and is useful to show how EPIC would work on aprotocol stack about which much is already known.</t>
