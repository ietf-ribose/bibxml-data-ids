      <t>This draft describes a profile for compressing RTP/UDP/IP using the Efficient Protocol Independent Compression (EPIC) [2] scheme. The RObust Header Compression [1] scheme is designed to compress packet headers over error prone channels. It is built around an extensible core framework that can be tailored to compress new protocol stacks by adding additional ROHC profiles. This profile gives behaviours similar to (a subset of) the functionality of [1] and is useful to show how EPIC would work on a protocol stack about which much is already known.</t>
