      <t>In networks supporting IPv6 the Internet Control Message Protocolversion 6 (ICMPv6) plays a fundamental role with a large number offunctions, and a correspondingly large number of message types andoptions. A number of security risks are associated with uncontrolledforwarding of ICMPv6 messages. On the other hand, compared with IPv4and the corresponding protocol ICMP, ICMPv6 is essential to thefunctioning of IPv6 rather than a useful auxiliary.This document provides some recommendations for ICMPv6 firewallfilter configuration that will allow propagation of ICMPv6 messagesthat are needed to maintain the functioning of the network but dropmessages which are potential security risks.</t>
