      <t>This document describes the extensions needed by certain features for the purpose of RSVP Graceful Restart. One of these extensions refers to the ability of a node to recover the ERO in the case it has performed an ERO expansion before control plane restart. Also a small modification is proposed in the basic procedure to support simultaneous multiple node restarts in a network. Specifically, a node should use a non- zero Recovery Time while in the recovery phase. This allows a node to determine at restart time if any of its neighbors has previously restarted and it is currently in the recovery phase.</t>
