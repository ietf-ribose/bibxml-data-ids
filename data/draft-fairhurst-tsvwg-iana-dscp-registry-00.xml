      <t>The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture specifies use of the DSField in the IPv4 and IPv6 packet header to carry the Diffserv Codepoint (DSCP). The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains a registry of assigned DSCP values. This update to RFC2474 requests a change to the IANA assignment method for Pool 3 of the registry to change this to Standards Action assignment. The update also removes permission for Local Use of the codepoints that form Pool 3 of the DSCP registry.</t>
