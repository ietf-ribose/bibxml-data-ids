    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a post-quantum cryptography (PQC) strategy for Domain Name System Security (DNSSEC) that includes two types of algorithms: one or more conservatively designed algorithms that are unlikely ever to need to be replaced, and one or more low-impact drop-in algorithms that are used the same way as a traditional signature algorithm. The conservatively designed algorithms can be used in a mode of operation that mitigates the operational impact of a large signature size. The combination provides both the routine performance of the low-impact algorithm and a resilient fallback to the conservatively designed choice. The draft outlines the strategy, provides recommendations for future testing and deployment, and highlights operational considerations in adopting PQC for DNSSEC.</t>
