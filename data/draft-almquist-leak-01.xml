      <t>This memo discusses how routers can 'leak' routing information learned from one routing domain into another routing domain. Although this memo is not an official product of the Router Requirements working group, it is being published as an Internet Draft because it is required reading for those who wish to actively participate in the Router Requirements sessions during the IETF meeting in Atlanta.</t>
