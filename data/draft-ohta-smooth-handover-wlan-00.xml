      <t>This memo describes, based on the experience of MIS (Mobile Internet Services, Inc.) for commercial mobile IP service over IEEE 802.11b based wireless LAN environment, how smooth handover between access points is implemented. The major obstacle for the smooth handover is time required to scan frequency bands and latency of mobile registration is not so much a problem, both of which is solved with terminals having two transceivers.</t>
