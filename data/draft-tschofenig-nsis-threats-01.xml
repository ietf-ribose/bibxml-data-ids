      <t>As the work in the NSIS working has begun to describe requirements and the framework people started thinking about possible security implication. This document should provide a starting point for the discussion at the NSIS working group mailing list regarding the security issues that have to be addressed by a protocol or within the framework. This document does not describe vulnerabilities of a particular protocol or threats of published NSIS framework proposals. This memo is furthermore meant to create awareness for security issues within the NSIS group. Security requirements related to the threat scenarios are described in [1].</t>
