      <t>The deployment of carrier-side stateless solution requires some particular considerations in mobile network contexts. The widely existed legacy network restricts the development of IP address provisioning based on DHCP-PD. The memo provided several potential approaches to facilitate the issues and provide the possibilities leveraging 3GPP mechanism. The stateless algorithm is required to be updated depending to the preferred solution accordingly.</t>
