      <t>The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has a certaincomputational and communication overhead with respect to the numberof round-trips required and the cryptographic operations involved.In remote access situations, the Extensible Authentication Protocol(EAP) is used for authentication, which adds several more round tripsand consequently latency.To re-establish security associations (SA) upon a failure recoverycondition is time consuming, especially when an IPsec peer, such as aVPN gateway, needs to re-establish a large number of SAs with variousend points. A high number of concurrent sessions might causeadditional problems for an IPsec peer during SA re-establishment.In order to avoid the need to re-run the key exchange protocol fromscratch it would be useful to provide an efficient way to resume anIKE/IPsec session. This document proposes an extension to IKEv2 thatallows a client to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway in a highlyefficient manner, utilizing a previously established IKE SA.A client can reconnect to a gateway from which it was disconnected.The proposed approach uses a ticket to store state information thatis later made available to the IKEv2 responder for re-authentication.Restoring state information by utilizing a ticket is one possibleway. This document does not specify the format of the ticket butrecommendations are provided.</t>
