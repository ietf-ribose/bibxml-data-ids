    <abstract>
      <t>The RFC Series has evolved to allow for the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs. While English remains the required language of the Series, the encoding of RFCs is now in UTF-8, allowing for a broader range of characters than typically used in the English language. This document describes requirements and guidelines for the RFC Editor regarding the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs. This document obsoletes RFC 7997. The differences reflect changes in the practices of the RFC series since RFC 7997 was published, and makes further changes based on agreements in the IETF community about what characters are allowed in RFCs.
