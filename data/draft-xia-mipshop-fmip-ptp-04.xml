      <t>Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers specification currently does notexplicitly define prefix management over point-to-point links when amobile node uses a prefix to formulate a new care-of-address. Inthis document a mechanism is developed for a previous access routerto request unique prefixes from a new access router, and in turn, theprevious access router advertises the prefixes to the mobile node fora new care-of-address configuration. Extensions to Mobile IPv6 FastHandovers specification are also specified in this document.</t>
