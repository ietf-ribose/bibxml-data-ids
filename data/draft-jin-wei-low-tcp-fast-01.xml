      <t>This document proposes FAST TCP, a modification to the TCP congestioncontrol algorithm for high-speed long-distance networks. The AIMD congestion control algorithm in the current TCP has equilibrium and dynamic problems that become more and more severe as bandwidth-delay product increases. FAST TCP uses feedbackinformation, in addition to packet loss, to address these problems in order to stabilize a network around a fair and efficientoperating point. .</t>
