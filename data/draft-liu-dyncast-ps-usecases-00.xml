      <t>Service providers are exploring the edge computing to achieve better response time, control over data and carbon energy saving by moving the computing services towards the edge of the network in 5G MEC (Multi-access Edge Computing) scenarios, virtualized central office, and others. Providing services by sharing computing resources from multiple edges is an emerging concept that is becoming more useful for computationally intensive tasks. Ideally, services should be computationally balanced using service-specific metrics instead of simply dispatching the service in a static way, e.g., to the geographically closest edge since this may cause unbalanced usage of computing resources at edges which further degrades user experience and system utilization. This draft provides an overview of scenarios and problems associated with realizing such scenarios. The document identifies several key areas which require more investigations in terms of architecture and protocol to achieve balanced computing and networking resource utilization among edges providing the services.</t>
