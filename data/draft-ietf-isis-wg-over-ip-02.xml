      <t>This draft describes an optional implementation technique within IS-IS [ISO90, Cal90a, Cal90b] used today by several ISPs for routing within their clouds. IS-IS is an interior gateway routing protocol developed originally by OSI and used with IP extensions as IGP. This draft describes how to encapsulate IS-IS packets in IPv4 [Pos81] format. Such an encapsulation has many advantages, one of those being the possibility to run integrated IS-IS on anything that understands IPv4, including avian carriers [Wai90]. Encapsulation of IS-IS PDUs in IPv6 is outside the scope of this document.</t>
