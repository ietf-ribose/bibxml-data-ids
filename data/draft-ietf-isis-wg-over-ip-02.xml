      <t>This draft describes an optional implementation technique withinIS-IS [ISO90, Cal90a, Cal90b] used today by several ISPs for routingwithin their clouds. IS-IS is an interior gateway routing protocoldeveloped originally by OSI and used with IP extensions as IGP. Thisdraft describes how to encapsulate IS-IS packets in IPv4 [Pos81]format. Such an encapsulation has many advantages, one of thosebeing the possibility to run integrated IS-IS on anything thatunderstands IPv4, including avian carriers [Wai90]. Encapsulation ofIS-IS PDUs in IPv6 is outside the scope of this document.</t>
