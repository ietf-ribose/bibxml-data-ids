    <abstract>
      <t>Data transfer using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is often interrupted by canceled requests or dropped connections. If the intended recipient can indicate how much of the data was received prior to interruption, a sender can resume data transfer at that point instead of attempting to transfer all of the data again. HTTP range requests support this concept of resumable downloads from server to client. This document describes a mechanism that supports resumable uploads from client to server using HTTP.</t>
