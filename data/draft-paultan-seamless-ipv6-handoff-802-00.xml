      <t>To achieve seamless layer 3 handover, mobile nodes must be able to perform movement detection and neighborhood candidate access routers discovery quickly and efficiently. In this document, we present a conceptual overview on how to extend the IEEE 802.11 Management frames to carry extensible application- specific Information Element, which allow access points to advertise the capabilities information of its associated network/provider and to improve movement detection. We believe that mobile nodes can thus dynamically discover neighboring candidate access routers or networks more quickly and efficiently, and also to obtain valuable capabilities information so as to select the 'best' target access router to initiate seamless handover.</t>
