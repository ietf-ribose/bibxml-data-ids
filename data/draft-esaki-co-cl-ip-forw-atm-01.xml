      <t>The framework of high throughput with small latent IP packet delivery architecture using ATM technology in large scaled heterogeneous internets keeping the current communication paradigm is studied. This memo discusses on how to carry TCP/IP over ATM, or in general, how to carry connectionless and/or connection oriented network layer protocol over connection oriented QoS-ed datalink layer. Low latency property of ATM is fully extracted both for connectionless and connection oriented communication over TCP/IP without changing the current architecture of TCP/IP network. Regarding connection oriented IP packet forwarding, source host, having the mapping functionality between flow-ID (e.g. in the SIPP16 header) and VCI/VPI value, forwards connection oriented IP packets cell-by-cell. Connectionless IP packets can be also transferred cell-by-cell through the dedicated (concatenated) ATM-VCCs which bypass IP processing at the intermediate routers, when the cache for re-directed ATM-VCCs is hit. Otherwise, they will be forwarded to the adjacent router (hop-by-hop IP forwarding). Also, the active connectionless IP packet flow can use a dedicated ATM-VCC as a IP forwarding cache.</t>
