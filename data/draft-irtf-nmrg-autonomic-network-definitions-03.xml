    <abstract>
      <t>Autonomic systems were first described in 2001. The fundamental goal is self-management, including self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing and self-protection. This document applies the concepts of autonomic systems to a network, and describes the definitions and design goals of Autonomic Networking. The high-level goal for an autonomic function is to have minimal dependencies on human administrators or centralized management systems. This usually implies distribution across network elements.</t>
