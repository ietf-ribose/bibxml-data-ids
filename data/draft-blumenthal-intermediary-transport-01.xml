      <t>The growth of the Internet has witnessed an emergence of transport services that rely on or can benefit from assistance of network intermediaries between communicating end-points. Such services, for example, include TCP performance enhancements, multimedia packet filtering, header compression, and prevention of Denial-of-Service.
