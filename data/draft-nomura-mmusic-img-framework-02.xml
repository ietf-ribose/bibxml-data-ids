      <t>This document defines a framework for the delivery of Internet Media Guides (IMGs). A media guide is a set of information (metadata) describing the features of multimedia content in order to subscribe to, manage and exchange multimedia content. Several protocols and methods exist that are able to deliver metadata over the Internet, giving information on Internet services, media and content. This existing knowledge is used to provide a general framework for Internet Media Guides and outlines existing scalability and flexibility issues, along with the desirable features that can solve these problems.</t>
