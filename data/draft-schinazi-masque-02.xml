      <t>This document describes MASQUE (Multiplexed Application Substrate over QUIC Encryption). MASQUE is a framework that allows concurrently running multiple networking applications inside an HTTP/3 connection. For example, MASQUE can allow a QUIC client to negotiate proxying capability with an HTTP/3 server, and subsequently make use of this functionality while concurrently processing HTTP/3 requests and responses. This document is a straw-man proposal. It does not contain enough details to implement the protocol, and is currently intended to spark discussions on the approach it is taking. Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the MASQUE IETF mailing list masque@ietf.org (mailto:masque@ietf.org) or on the GitHub repository which contains the draft: https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/masque-drafts (https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/masque-drafts).</t>
