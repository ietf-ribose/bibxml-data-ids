    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a standardized protocol for *discovery and invocation of AI agents* over HTTP. It defines a common metadata format for describing AI agents (including capabilities, I/O specifications, supported languages, tags, authentication methods, etc.), a semantic search mechanism to discover and match agents based on capabilities, and a unified RESTful invocation interface for calling those agents. The goal is to enable cross-platform interoperability among AI agents by providing a *“discover and match”* mechanism and a *unified invocation entry point* via standard HTTP. Security considerations, including authentication and trust measures, are also discussed. This specification aims to facilitate the formation of multi-agent systems by making it easy to find the right agent for a task and invoke it in a consistent manner across different vendors and platforms.</t>
