      <t>This document defines a simple protocol for retrieving metadata about named entities, or named collections of entities. The goal of the protocol is to profile various aspects of HTTP to allow requesters to rely on certain, rigorously defined, behaviour. This document is a product of the Research and Education Federations (REFEDS) Working Group process.</t>
