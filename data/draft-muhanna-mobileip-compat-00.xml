    <abstract>
      <t>Mobile-IP, together with several other supporting standards such as Reverse Tunneling and the Challenge-Response extensions, have all been recently revised. Although such revisions are for the most part backward compatible with the original versions, sometimes static configuration of Mobile Nodes and Mobility Agents is required to ensure smooth transition and avoid any possible conflict between different standard versions implemented by already-deployed equipment. In this draft we define compatibility extensions for Mobile-IP Agent Advertisement, Registration Request and Registration Reply messages that allow all Mobile-IPv4 entities to dynamically synchronize their 'compatibility versions', defined as the versions of the Mobile-IP standards that a particular node is able to support. This solution offers a dynamic mechanism which informs all entities involved in a Mobile-IP exchange of the version of the standard they support, therefore reducing the need to statically configure such information at Mobile Nodes or Mobility Agents</t>
