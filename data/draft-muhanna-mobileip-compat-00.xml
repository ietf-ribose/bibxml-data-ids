      <t>Mobile-IP, together with several other supporting standards suchas Reverse Tunneling and the Challenge-Response extensions, haveall been recently revised. Although such revisions are for themost part backward compatible with the original versions,sometimes static configuration of Mobile Nodes and Mobility Agentsis required to ensure smooth transition and avoid any possibleconflict between different standard versions implemented byalready-deployed equipment. In this draft we define compatibilityextensions for Mobile-IP Agent Advertisement, Registration Requestand Registration Reply messages that allow all Mobile-IPv4entities to dynamically synchronize their 'compatibilityversions', defined as the versions of the Mobile-IP standards thata particular node is able to support. This solution offers adynamic mechanism which informs all entities involved in aMobile-IP exchange of the version of the standard they support,therefore reducing the need to statically configure suchinformation at Mobile Nodes or Mobility Agents</t>
