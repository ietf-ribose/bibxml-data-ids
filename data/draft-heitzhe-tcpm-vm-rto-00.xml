      <t>A Round Trip Time (RTT) estimate that decays performs badly in a bursty environment. A round trip time estimator that does not decay for a period of time is proposed. It does not require a minimum value to be configured. It works equally well when the typical RTT is 100uS as when it is 10 seconds.</t>
