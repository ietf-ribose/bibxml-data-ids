      <t>This document proposes a way to synchronise existing trust anchors automatically between a child zone and its parent. The protocol can be used for other Resource Records that are required to delegate from a parent to a child such as NS and glue records. The synchronization allows for a third party to be involved, thus the protocol is suitable for both cases, whether you have to communicate to the registry or to the registrar.</t>
