      <t>Application- and transport-layer gateways are considered harmful to the Internet since they hinder the operation of existing and new end-to-end protocols. A survey of such upper-level gateways shows that they exist because of realm-specific performance, security, and protocol needs of certain portions of the Internet. Expecting this realm-specific functionality to be added manually deployted to every end hosts or application is, conversely, harmful to the flexibility of using the Internet to link disparate networks.</t>
