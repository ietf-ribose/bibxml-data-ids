    <abstract>
      <t>RFC9252 specifies that implementations MUST provide a mechanism to control advertisement of SRv6-based BGP service routes on a per neighbor and per service basis. This document provides analysis on the problems that may be encountered if the SRv6-based service routes are received by the MPLS-only PEs. Some currently used SRv6-based service routes advertisement controlling methods by configuration or network planning are also described. And this document proposes an automatic advertisement controlling method for SRv6-based service routes by defining a new Capability Code for SRv6-based BGP service capability.</t>
