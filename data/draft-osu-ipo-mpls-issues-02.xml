      <t>This draft presents a summary of issues related to transmission of IP packets over optical networks. This is a compilation of many drafts presented so far in IETF. The goal is to create a common document, which by including all the views and proposals will serve as a better reference point for further discussion. The novelty of this draft is that we try to cover all the main areas of integration and deployment of IP and optical networks including architecture, routing, signaling, management, and survivability.</t>
