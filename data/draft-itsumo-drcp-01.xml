      <t>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a frameworkfor passing configuration information to hosts [DHC]. DHCP was,however, designed for hosts on a fixed LAN, not for nodes roamingamong commercial wireless networks. A Mobile IP [MIP] Foreign Agentgives some powerful plug and play capability for roaming hosts,especially when combined with some recent proposals [e.g., MIPA,MIPC, MIPD, MIPN, HAW, CEL, TIA]. Mobile IP functionality, howeveris not always needed and for some dynamic networks it may beundesirable to use Foreign Agents. This draft proposes a lightweightdynamic configuration protocol, called the Dynamic Registration andConfiguration Protocol (DRCP). DRCP borrows heavily from DHCP andcan switch to using DHCP protocol if only DHCP servers are present inthe network; but adds features critical to roaming users. Mostimportantly, DRCP allows rapid configuration by moving addressconsistency checking from the critical path. Other new featuresallow: a) clients to know when to get a new address independent ofthe layer-2 access technology, b) efficient use of scarce wirelessbandwidth, c) clients to be routers, d) dynamic addition or deletionof address pools to any DRCP node, and e) message exchange withoutbroadcast.</t>
