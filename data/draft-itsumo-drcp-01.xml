    <abstract>
      <t>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides a framework for passing configuration information to hosts [DHC]. DHCP was, however, designed for hosts on a fixed LAN, not for nodes roaming among commercial wireless networks. A Mobile IP [MIP] Foreign Agent gives some powerful plug and play capability for roaming hosts, especially when combined with some recent proposals [e.g., MIPA, MIPC, MIPD, MIPN, HAW, CEL, TIA]. Mobile IP functionality, however is not always needed and for some dynamic networks it may be undesirable to use Foreign Agents. This draft proposes a lightweight dynamic configuration protocol, called the Dynamic Registration and Configuration Protocol (DRCP). DRCP borrows heavily from DHCP and can switch to using DHCP protocol if only DHCP servers are present in the network; but adds features critical to roaming users. Most importantly, DRCP allows rapid configuration by moving address consistency checking from the critical path. Other new features allow: a) clients to know when to get a new address independent of the layer-2 access technology, b) efficient use of scarce wireless bandwidth, c) clients to be routers, d) dynamic addition or deletion of address pools to any DRCP node, and e) message exchange without broadcast.</t>
