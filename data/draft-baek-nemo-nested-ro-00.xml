      <t>This document describes a nested NEMO Route Opimization (NNRO) protocol for the communications between any two nodes in the same nested mobile network. A nested NEMO Route Opimization message is used to exchange the routing information between two mobile network nodes in the same nested mobile network. The protocol is designed in a way such that the mobility of the entire nested mobile network is transparent to the nodes therein.</t>
