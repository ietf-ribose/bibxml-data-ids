      <t>This document will provide guidance on the design of methods to avoid congestion collapse and to react to incipient congestion. The present document is for discussion and comment by the IETF. If published, it plans to update or replace the Best Current Practice in BCP 41, which currently includes "Congestion Control Principles" provided in RFC2914. The current recommendations and requirements on this topic are distributed across many documents in the RFC series. This document therefore seeks to gather and consolidate these recommendations in an annexe. Based on these specifications, and Internet engineering experience, the document provides input to the design of new congestion control methods in protocols. This revision updates the source to a modern XML format, and is for discussion by tsvwg.</t>
