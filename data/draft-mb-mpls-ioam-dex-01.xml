    <abstract>
      <t>In-Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM), defined in RFC 9197, is an on-path telemetry method to collect and transport the operational state and telemetry information that can be used in calculating various performance metrics. IOAM Direct Export (IOAM- DEX) is one of the IOAM Option types, in which the operational state and telemetry information are collected according to the specified profile and exported in a manner and format defined by a local policy. MPLS Network Actions (MNA) techniques are meant to indicate actions to be performed on any combination of Label Switched Paths (LSPs), MPLS packets, and the node itself, and also to transfer data needed for these actions. This document explores how MNA can be used for collecting on-path operational state and telemetry information using IOAM-DEX Option.</t>
