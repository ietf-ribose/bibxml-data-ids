      <t>A midcom agent does not know whether to ask for a ruleset to be installed in a middlebox or not. Even when it does ask, in some situations the middlebox does not know how to apply the ruleset. This document tries to solve these problems without adding an overwhelming amount of complexity to every agent and middlebox.</t>
