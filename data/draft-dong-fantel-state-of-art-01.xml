    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides an overview of routing technologies that address the needs of traffic engineering and load balancing, with a focus on fast notification for example in adaptive or perceptive routing. As the scale and complexity of networks grow, these technologies are becoming increasingly important when fault tolerance and rapid convergence are critical. This document explores existing solutions from both the IETF and the broader industry, highlighting their applicability to various use cases, including AI workloads and general services that demand low-latency, fault recovery, and dynamic load distribution across data center networks and inter data center. It also offers suggestions for potential IETF initiatives to further develop and standardize these techniques.</t>
