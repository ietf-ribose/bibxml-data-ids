      <t>With the growing requirements for reliable Internet connectivity,increasing number of enterprises choose to acquire Internetconnectivity from more than one Internet Service Providers (ISPs) forthe purpose of connectivity redundancy and traffic load distribution.The potential of large number of multi-connection sites impose directchallenge on routing aggregation and consequently on scalability ofthe global Internet routing. Hence a solution is highly desirablewhich provides the benefit of multi-connection as well as the betterscalability of the global routing system. In addition, such solutionneeds to be simple enough to be operationally manageable. With thefast growth of ISP networks as well as enterprise networks, networkmanageability is becoming an increasingly important requirement. Thisdocument describes a solution which achieves the stated goals.</t>
