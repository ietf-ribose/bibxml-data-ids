      <t>With the growing requirements for reliable Internet connectivity, increasing number of enterprises choose to acquire Internet connectivity from more than one Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for the purpose of connectivity redundancy and traffic load distribution. The potential of large number of multi-connection sites impose direct challenge on routing aggregation and consequently on scalability of the global Internet routing. Hence a solution is highly desirable which provides the benefit of multi-connection as well as the better scalability of the global routing system. In addition, such solution needs to be simple enough to be operationally manageable. With the fast growth of ISP networks as well as enterprise networks, network manageability is becoming an increasingly important requirement. This document describes a solution which achieves the stated goals.</t>
