      <t>Multipath transmission is an important way to improve the quality of service for message transport. This document defines a multipath message transmission protocol, which is a special application profile of multipath transport protocol suite defined in Multipath Transport System Based on Application-level Relay (MPTS-AR). Apart from behaviors of user agent defined in MPTS-AR, user agent should be also responsible for message reliable transmission,including connective session establishment, sequenced deliver, select acknowledgement, retransmission, recombination and congestion avoidance, etc. This document describes those new or changed behaviors, and expands the MPTP format to meet them.Moreover this document illustrates the details of multipath transmission mechanism reference to the reliable transmission characteristics.</t>
