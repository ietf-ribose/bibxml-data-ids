      <t>This document defines new method of calculating the authentication HASHof the IKE [RFC-2409] protocol. It fixes known problems with the IKE.The way the HASH is currently defined in the [RFC-2409] does not authen-ticate the ISAKMP [RFC-2408] packet header, nor does it authenticate anyextra ISAKMP payloads inside phase 1 ISAKMP packets. This causes a secu-rity problem when using extra ISAKMP payloads as already defined in theIKE and DOI [RFC-2407] (vendor ID payload, INITIAL-CONTACT notificationetc). There is also suggestion how to fix the Phase 2 authenticationhashes so that they will also authenticate the ISAKMP packet header.</t>
