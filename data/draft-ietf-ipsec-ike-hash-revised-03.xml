      <t>This document defines new method of calculating the authentication HASH of the IKE [RFC-2409] protocol. It fixes known problems with the IKE. The way the HASH is currently defined in the [RFC-2409] does not authen- ticate the ISAKMP [RFC-2408] packet header, nor does it authenticate any extra ISAKMP payloads inside phase 1 ISAKMP packets. This causes a secu- rity problem when using extra ISAKMP payloads as already defined in the IKE and DOI [RFC-2407] (vendor ID payload, INITIAL-CONTACT notification etc). There is also suggestion how to fix the Phase 2 authentication hashes so that they will also authenticate the ISAKMP packet header.</t>
