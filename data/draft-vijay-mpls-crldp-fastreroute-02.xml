      <t>This document proposes extensions to existing CR-LDP for setting up MPLS backup tunnels. These tunnels can protect Label Switched Paths on an exclusive bandwidth basis or shared bandwidth on the back up paths, as desired by the initiator of the tunnel at the head end node. Several backup segments are maintained for a single LSP and they are meant to provide link and node failure protection along various segments of the LSP. Sharing of backup segments across multiple LSPs is also facilitated to achieve scalability</t>
