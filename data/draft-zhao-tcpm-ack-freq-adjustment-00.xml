      <t>TCP Delayed ACK is a widely deployed mechanism that can effectively reduce protocol overhead in many scenarios. The TARR option has been defined, which allows a sender to request a specific ACK frequency from a receiver. However, there is no clear method for adjusting the ACK frequency during data transmission over a TCP connection. This document provides a method for adjusting the ACK frequency by considering the different phases of congestion control algorithms.</t>
