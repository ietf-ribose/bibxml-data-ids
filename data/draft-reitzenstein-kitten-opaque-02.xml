    <abstract>
      <t>This specification describes a Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL, RFC4422) authentication mechanisms based on the OPAQUE asymmetric password-authenticated key agreement (PAKE) protocol. The mechanism offers two distinct advantages over the SCRAM family of mechanisms. The underlying OPAQUE protocol provides the ability for clients to register without the server having to have access to the clear text password of an user, preventing password exfiltration at registration. Secondly a successful authentication produces a long- term secret key specific to the user that can be used to access encrypted server-side data without needing to share keys between clients via side-band mechanisms. When used in combination with TLS or an equivalent security layer these mechanisms allow for secure channel binding.</t>
