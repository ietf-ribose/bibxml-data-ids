      <t>This document introduces some of the extensions required in existing IGP routing protocols to support sub-sequent signalling for dynamically established SONET/SDH circuits using GMPLS-based control plane architecture [GMPLS-ARCH]. In particular, it specifies the GMPLS routing extensions to OSPF and IS-IS routing protocols for SONET/SDH networks using [GMPLS-RTG] as guideline. The current document is based on the Traffic Engineering (TE) extensions defined in [OSPF-TE] and [ISIS-TE]. It supports link bundling (aka TE Links) as defined in [MPLS-BDL]. This document proposes several new sub-TLVs for SONET/SDH network control which complement those proposed in [GMPLS-OSPF] and [GMPLS-ISIS]. The proposed encoding does not preclude any further integration in these documents that the current one intends to complement.</t>
