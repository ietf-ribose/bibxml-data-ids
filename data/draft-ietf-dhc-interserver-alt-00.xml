      <t>The DHCP protocol is designed to allow for multiple DHCP servers, so that reliability of DHCP service can be improved through the use of redundant servers. To provide redundant service, all of the DHCP servers must be configured with the same information about assigned IP addresses and parameters; i.e., all of the servers must be configured with the same bindings. Because DHCP servers may dynamically assign new addresses or configuration parameters, or extend the lease on an existing address assignment, the bindings on some servers may become out of date. The DHCP inter-server protocol provides an automatic mechanism for synchronization of the bindings stored on a set of cooperating DHCP servers. This draft is a direct extension of draft-ietf-dhc-interserver-00.txt, but has been renamed draft-ietf-dhc-interserver-alt-00.txt since an alternative proposal (also a direct extension of draft-ietf-dhc-interserver-00.txt but in a different direction) exists named draft-ietf-dhc-interserver-01.txt.</t>
