      <t>The ICE-TCP mechanism is currently regarded as of limited usefulnessdue to the low success rate of TCP simultaneous open for NATtraversal. This document presents a vision of the ICE-TCP documentas an extensible framework for negotiating a variety of approachesfor establishing a TCP connection between NATed hosts. This documentfurther proposes significantly extending the current set ofcollection mechanisms to encompass a wide variety of technologiesthat are currently available, including UPnP, SOCKS, and Teredo.Because several of these technologies are already widely deployed,the direct connection rate should be significantly higher than usingstraight TCP alone. We envision that as future TCP connectionestablishment techniques are developed, they too will specify an ICEencoding that will allow their negotiation.</t>
