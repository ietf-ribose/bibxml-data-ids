      <t>Network Slicing is one of the core featrures in 5G. End-to-end network slicing consists of 3 major types of network segments: Access Network (AN), Mobile Core Network (CN) and Transport Network (TN). This draft describes the procedure of mapping relationship between 5G end-to-end network slice into and transport network slice defined in IETF. This draft also intends to expose some gaps in the existing network management plane and data plane to support inter-domain network slice mapping. Further work may require cooperation between IETF and 3GPP (or other standard organizations). The definition of data model, signaling protocol extension and new encapsulation is out of the scope of this draft.</t>
