      <t>Certain established and longstanding terms of art, used as technical terminology, are now considered contentious and can be considered harmful when used in discussion, in debate, and in reading, following, accepting the authority of, and complying with, existing technical documentation that unfortunately uses those terms that were not considered to be at all contentious, but clear and entirely uncontroversial normal use, when that technical documentation was originally authored or published. The use of such now-deplorable terms of art should be deprecated, and those terms should ideally be replaced with approved, accepted, more effective, inoffensive terms of art wherever possible. Any new use of those original terms must be carefully considered and fully justified before that use is agreed by consensus and submitted for careful approval in documents. Recommended replacement substitute terms should be considered for inclusion instead. A process for identifying and recommending replacements to those harmful terms is outlined here.</t>
