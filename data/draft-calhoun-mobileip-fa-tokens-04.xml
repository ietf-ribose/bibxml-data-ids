      <t>The Mobile IP Working Group has been working on defining its AAA requirements, which currently supports a Key Distribution Center (KDC) model that issues temporary session keys for use between the mobility nodes. In order to support real-time traffic, the Mobile IP architecture also requires that hand-off be done in a quick and efficient manner, and has provisions to allow new foreign agents to retrieve the session keys from the AAA infrastructure.</t>
