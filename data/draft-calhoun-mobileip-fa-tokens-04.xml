      <t>The Mobile IP Working Group has been working on defining its AAArequirements, which currently supports a Key Distribution Center(KDC) model that issues temporary session keys for use between themobility nodes. In order to support real-time traffic, the Mobile IParchitecture also requires that hand-off be done in a quick andefficient manner, and has provisions to allow new foreign agents toretrieve the session keys from the AAA infrastructure.</t>
