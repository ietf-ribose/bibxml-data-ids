      <t>Mesh Confirmation Protocol (Mesh/Confirm) is a three-party Web Service that supports a transactional second factor confirmation mechanism that provides a superset of the capabilities of traditional second factor authentication schemes. The three parties in the protocol are Enquirer who posts a confirmation request, a Responder who may or may not respond to the request and the Broker which provides a repository to which requests and responses are posted.
