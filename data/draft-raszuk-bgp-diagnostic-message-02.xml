      <t>BGP protocol lacks self diagnostic tools which would allow formonitoring and detection of any possible bgp state databasedifferences between BGP_RIB_Out of the sender and BGP_RIB_In of thereceiver over BGP peering session. It also lacks of build inmechanism to inform peer about subset of prefixes received oversession which experienced some errors and which per protocolspecification either resulted in attribute drop or "treat-as-withdraw" action.The intention of this document is to start a new class of work whichwill make BGP protocol and therefor assuring services constructedwith the help of BGP protocol to become much more reliable androbust.</t>
