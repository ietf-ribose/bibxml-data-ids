      <t>This draft offers a proposal to form a new IAB program called the RFC Editor Future Development Program. This proposal is based on the discussions held during three virtual meetings in September and October 2019, and requests a new program, open to all, that will drive consensus around any changes to the RFC Editor model through extensive community engagement and outreach to a broad set of stakeholder communities.</t>
