    <abstract>
      <t>This memo aims to highlight specific "residual" threats in Mobile IPv6 protocol. We call these threats "residual" simply because they were rightfully deemed not urgent during the design of Mobile IPv6 protocol. However, these threats are somehow benefiting from new mechanisms and/or extensions built on top of Mobile IPv6 protocol to improve their effects and likelihood. Hence, our main goal is to motivate designers to re-assess their potential taking into consideration these new mechanisms.</t>
