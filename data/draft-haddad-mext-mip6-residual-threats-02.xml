      <t>This memo aims to highlight specific "residual" threats in MobileIPv6 protocol. We call these threats "residual" simply because theywere rightfully deemed not urgent during the design of Mobile IPv6protocol. However, these threats are somehow benefiting from newmechanisms and/or extensions built on top of Mobile IPv6 protocol toimprove their effects and likelihood. Hence, our main goal is tomotivate designers to re-assess their potential taking intoconsideration these new mechanisms.</t>
