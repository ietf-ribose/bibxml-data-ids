      <t>This draft specifies some new PDU operations intended to optimizeSNMP requests for performance.This draft is not a complete specification, but merely is intendedto illustrate concepts which can then be discussed within the EoSworking group. A complete specification will be completed after theagreed features and packet structure is fairly well solidified sothe author doesn't have to rewrite large portions of stuff ;-).There are no error handling codes or elements of procedures definedyet. The concepts, however, have been thought out about a lot.Feedback on what you see within would be greatly appreciated at thispoint.</t>
