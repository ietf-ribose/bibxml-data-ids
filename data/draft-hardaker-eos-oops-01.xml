      <t>This draft specifies some new PDU operations intended to optimize SNMP requests for performance. This draft is not a complete specification, but merely is intended to illustrate concepts which can then be discussed within the EoS working group. A complete specification will be completed after the agreed features and packet structure is fairly well solidified so the author doesn't have to rewrite large portions of stuff ;-). There are no error handling codes or elements of procedures defined yet. The concepts, however, have been thought out about a lot. Feedback on what you see within would be greatly appreciated at this point.</t>
