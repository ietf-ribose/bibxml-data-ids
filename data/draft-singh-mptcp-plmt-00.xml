      <t>The single path transport provided by the Transmission ControlProtocol (TCP) can be extended to a multipath transport session formulti-homed end hosts by coupling several TCP connections overmultiple interfaces of the end hosts. Payload Multi-connectionTransport (PLMT) is a multipath protocol variant that encodes allthe control/signaling information in the payload of TCP connectionsand therefore requires no additional TCP options. PLMT allows forthe simultaneous use of the multiple connections over potentiallydisjoint paths while being mostly backward compatible to single pathtransport of TCP. PLMT operates as an additional protocol layerbetween the network stack and the application layer. This documentdescribes PLMT as an example for a multipath mechanism that couldpossibly be realized entirely in the user-space of an operatingsystem.</t>
