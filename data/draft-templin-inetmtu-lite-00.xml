      <t>The nominal Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the Internet has become 1500 bytes, but existing IP/*/IPv4 tunneling mechanisms impose an encapsulation overhead that can reduce the effective path MTU to smaller values. Additionally, existing IP/*/IPv4 tunneling mechanisms are limited in their ability to discover and utilize larger MTUs. This document specifies minimal mechanisms for conveying packets over IP/*/IPv4 tunnels that address these issues.</t>
