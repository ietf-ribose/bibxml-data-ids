      <t>This document specifies the payload format for encapsulating QuickTime media streams in the Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP). This specification is intended for QuickTime media/codec types that are not already handled by other RTP payload specifications. Each QuickTime media track within a movie is sent over a separate RTP session and synchronized using standard RTP techniques. A static QuickTime payload type (if assigned) or a dynamic payload type may be used. A QuickTime header within the RTP payload is defined to carry the media type and other media specific information. A packetization scheme is defined for the media data. This specification is intended for streaming stored QuickTime movies as well as live QuickTime content.</t>
