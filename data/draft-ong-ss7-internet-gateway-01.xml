      <t>This memo describes the Bay Networks Gateway architecture for interworking of PSTN SS7 with Internet. Signaling System 7 (SS7) networking is the primary means used in the PSTN for control of circuit-switched connections and value added PSTN services such as freephone (800/888) number translation, calling card validation and Intelligent Network services. The Gateway architecture provides a scalable method of supporting interworking between SS7 network elements and Internet elements such as a Remote Access Server (RAS). The Gateway architecture can support connection control and database access. Gateway design, functions and protocol are described.</t>
