      <t>While an IPv6 site is being renumbered, both DHCPv6 and ND may beused to reconfigure the host addresses. This may cause potentialaddress configuration conflicts during renumbering procedure. Theissue mainly include two situations: a) Address configuration methodconflict, which means a host receives a new prefix comes from anotheraddress configuration protocol. b) Address prefix conflict, a hostreceives both DHCPv6 and ND address configuration messages whichassign different address prefixes. This documents analyzes theconflict issues and proposes a conflict report mechanism for hosts toreport the conflicts to DHCPv6 servers.</t>
