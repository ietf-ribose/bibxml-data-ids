      <t>CoAP is being standardised as an application level REST-based protocol. A single CoAP message is typically encapsulated and transmitted using UDP. This draft examines the requirements and possible solutions for conveying CoAP packets to end points over alternative transports to UDP. While UDP remains an optimal solution for use in IP-based constrained environments and nodes, M2M communication using non-IP networks, NAT and firewall traversal issues and possibly mechanisms incurring a lower overhead to CoAP/ HTTP gateways provide compelling motivation for understanding how CoAP can operate in various other environments.</t>
