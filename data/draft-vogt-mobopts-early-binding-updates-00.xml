      <t>Mobile IPv6 defines a return-routability procedure for secure use of route optimization between unacquainted nodes. The handover latency caused by the procedure can significantly impact delay-sensitive applications, however. This document presents an optimization to Mobile IPv6 that eliminates the latency. The optimization is realized as an optional, and fully backward-compatible, extension to Mobile IPv6.</t>
