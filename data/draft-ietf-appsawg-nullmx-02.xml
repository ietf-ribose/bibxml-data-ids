    <abstract>
      <t>Internet mail determines the address of a receiving server through the DNS, first by looking for an MX record and then by looking for an A/AAAA record as a fallback. Unfortunately this means that the A/ AAAA record is taken to be mail server address even when that address does not accept mail. The NULL MX RR formalizes the existing mechanism by which a domain announces that it accepts no mail, which permits significant operational efficiencies.</t>
