      <t>This memo presents the current specification of the Application Programming Interface used to access the services provided by the BBN implementation of the ST-II Protocol (RFC 1190). It is being circulated as a basis for discussion of a generic API. A generic API will allow application developers to implement applications capable of running on any ST-II implementation that conforms to the API. Comments and suggestions for the generic API are solicited from the community by the CIP Working Group. Some comments that have already been received are included in the Appendix.</t>
