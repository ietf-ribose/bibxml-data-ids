      <t>This document discusses how to build the large-scale Mobile IP network through the MPLS network. One small-scale Mobile IP network could be connected to other networks through the MPLS backbone network. It proposes the MPLS network architecture to provide the large-scale Mobile IP network. Specifically, it proposes that the label distribution protocol (LDP) can be applied to set up the Label switched path (LSP) tunnels between the mobile agents (that is, Foreign Agents and Home Agents)[3]. It means that the IP-in-IP tunnels can be replaced by one or multiple Label Switched Paths (LSPs) on the MPLS network.</t>
