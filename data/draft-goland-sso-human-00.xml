      <t>This document defines how to enable a federated single sign on (SSO) environment across HTTP using existing HTTP/1.0 compliant clients that support 303 redirects. The goal of the system is to enable a user to authenticate to multiple websites using a single identity. Further, the mechanism must work without requiring the user to upgrade their existing web client.</t>
