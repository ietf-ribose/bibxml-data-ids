      <t>This memo specifies 6rd's multicast component so that IPv6 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv6 servers. In the 6rd encapsulation solution, multicast communication is completely integrated into the 6rd tunnel. In the 6rd translation solution, the protocol is based on proxying MLD at the 6rd Customer Edge router interworking the MLD messages to IGMP messages and sending them upstream through a network which supports IPv4 multicast. The 6rd Border Relay is a multicast router and interworks the IGMP to MLD for onward propasgation toward the IPv6 multicast source. IPv6 Multicast data received at 6rd Border Relay is translated into IPv4 multicast data and and delivered through the IPv4 multicast tree downstream to the 6rd Customer Edge. The latter translates it back to IPv6 multicast data then delivers it to the hosts.</t>
