      <t>Nested MIP [NestMIP] and Concatenated MIP [ConcatMIP] provide means to support both localization and aggregation of MIP signalling. They achieve this by providing two distinct layers of MIP signalling and forwarding; a local access layer that provides local mobility management and local access services, and a remote access layer that provides remote access back to a home subnet. The local access layer provides a regional address from a Regional Mobility Agent (a regional HA) that is then used as a CCoA for the remote access layer. Inter-FA movement and MIP signalling at the local access layer then automatically supports the hand-off of potentially multiple parallel remote access sessions. Nested MIP achieves this through encapsulation whilst Concatenated MIP achieves it though various forms of CoA switching. This draft describes the localised and aggregated MIP signalling model for managing both the Local Access and Remote Access MIP layers. This includes inter-FA and Inter-RMA hand-offs within and between Nesting and Concatenating Regional Mobility Agents. This is necessary to support incremental, heterogeneous deployment that is required given that Nested MIP is deployable now whilst Concatenated MIP requires additional and significant standards and development work.</t>
