    <abstract>
      <t>The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol schema, defined in RFC [RFC7643] defines the complex core schema attributes "roles" and "entitlements". For both of these concepts, frequently only a predetermined set of values are accepted by a SCIM service provider. The values that are accepted may vary per customer or tenant based on customizable configuration in the service provider's application or based on other criteria such as what services have been purchased or resources associated with entitlements. This document defines an extension to the SCIM 2.0 standard to allow SCIM service providers to represent available data pertaining to SCIM resources, roles and entitlements so that SCIM clients can consume this information and provide easier management of SCIM resources, role and entitlement assignments.</t>
