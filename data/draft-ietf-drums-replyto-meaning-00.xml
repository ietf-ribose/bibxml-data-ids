    <abstract>
      <t>This is a candidate proposal for one way which the problems with the reply-to header in email could be resolved. Under no circumstances should this be implemented as it is only a candidate for a solution and no decision has yet been made. This proposal distinguishes the different incompatible uses of the Reply-To header with a new Reply-To-Meaning header. This has the advantage of being relatively simple, not invalidating most current practices and allowing mail user agents to present more predictable user interfaces.</t>
