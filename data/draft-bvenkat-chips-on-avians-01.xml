    <abstract>
      <t>This memo describes an experimental method for the funneling IP datagrams using tweets and chirps, through avian carriers which are embedded with a processor/chip that is biomedically engineered to fit in their tiny brains. This specification is primarily useful in Metropolitan Area Networks where agile predatory domestic or feral species are not widespread. This is an experimental, not recommended method.</t>
