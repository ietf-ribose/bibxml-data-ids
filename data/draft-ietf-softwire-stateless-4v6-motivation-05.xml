      <t>IPv4 service continuity is one of the most pressing problems that must be resolved by Service Providers during the IPv6 transition period - especially after the exhaustion of the public IPv4 address space.

This document elaborates on the motivations for the need to undertake a companion effort to specify stateless IPv4 over IPv6 approaches.</t>
