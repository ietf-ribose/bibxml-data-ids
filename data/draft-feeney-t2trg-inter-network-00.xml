      <t>The breadth of IoT applications implies that future wireless environments will be characterized by the presence of many diverse, administratively independent IoT networks operating in the same physical location. In many cases, these networks will use unlicensed spectrum, due to its low cost and ease of deployment. However, this spectrum is becoming increasingly crowded. IoT networks will therefore be subject to wireless interference, both from similar networks and from networks that use the channel in very different ways. To date, there have been few studies or testbeds that fully reflect this aspect of the future IoT operating environment. This document describes some of the main issues in network co-existence in IoT environments, focusing on protocol-level interactions. It identifies two issues for the IRTF t2trg community. The first is to define best practices for performance evaluation and protocol design in the context of inter-network interference. The second is the potential use of higher layer protocols to actively participate in interference mitigation.</t>
