    <abstract>
      <t>There has been an increasing level of discussion within the IETF about the best Working Group (WG) structures for handling the wide array of DNS work being conducted within the IETF. Wes Hardaker was asked to gather information from the community at large through email, hallway discussions, and meetings and create a small team to discuss potential structural changes to be shared with the community. This document is the result of that effort.</t>
