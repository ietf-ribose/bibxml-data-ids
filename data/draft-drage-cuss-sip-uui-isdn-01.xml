      <t>The motivation and use cases for interworking and transporting ITU-T DSS1 User-user information element data in SIP are described in the "Problem Statement and Requirements for Transporting User to User Call Control Information in SIP" document. As networks move to SIP it is important that applications requiring this data can continue to function in SIP networks as well as the ability to interwork with this ISDN service for end-to- end transparency. This document defines a usage of the User-to-User header field to enable interworking with this ISDN service. This document is covers the interworking with both public ISDN and private ISDN capabilities, so the interworking with QSIG will also be addressed.</t>
