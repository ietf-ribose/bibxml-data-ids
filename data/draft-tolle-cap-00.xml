      <t>This document describes a UDP/IP adaptation of the IEEE 802.15.4-based ZigBee Application Protocol that enables IP hosts tocommunicate using the application profiles and data models describedby that protocol, over a wide range of links. This modified versionof the ZigBee Application Protocol is named CAP (Compact ApplicationProtocol), and it is intended to provide a complete stack ofapplication profiles, data exchange, binding operations, securityprotocols, and discovery to IP-networked hosts and embedded devices.The protocol's domain of applicability includes IEEE 802.15.4-based6LoWPAN devices, but also those on conventional wired and wirelesslinks and emerging powerline communication networks.</t>
