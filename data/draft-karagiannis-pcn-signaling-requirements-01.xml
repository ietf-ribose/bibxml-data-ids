      <t>Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. The overall PCN architecture is described in RFC 5559. This memo describes the requirements for the signaling applied within the PCN domain: PCN feedback is carried from the PCN-egress-node to the decision point and the decision point may demand for the measurement and delivery of the PCN rate sent at the PCN-ingress-node. The decision point may be either collocated with the PCN-ingress-node or a centralized node.</t>
