      <t>The application specific routing requirements for Urban Low Power andLossy Networks (U-L2Ns) are presented in this document. In the nearfuture, sensing and actuating nodes will be placed outdoors in urbanenvironments so as to improve the citizens' living conditions as wellas to monitor compliance with increasingly strict environmental laws.These field nodes are expected to measure and report a wide gamut ofdata, such as required in smart metering, waste disposal,meteorological, pollution and allergy reporting applications. Themajority of these nodes is expected to communicate wirelessly which- given the limited radio range - requires the use of suitablemulti-hop routing protocols. The design of such protocols will bemainly impacted by the limited resources of the nodes (memory,processing power, battery, etc) and the particularities of theoutdoors urban application scenario. As such, for a wireless rollsolution to be competitive with other incumbent and emergingsolutions, the protocol ought to be energy-efficient, scalable andautonomous. This documents aims to specify a set of requirementsreflecting these and further U-L2Ns tailored characteristics.</t>
