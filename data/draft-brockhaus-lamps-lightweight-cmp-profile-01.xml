      <t>The goal of this document is to facilitate interoperability and automation by profiling the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) version 2 and the related Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) version 2. It specifies a subset of CMP and CRMF focusing on typical uses cases relevant for managing certificates of devices in many industrial and IoT scenarios. To limit the overhead of certificate management for more constrained devices only the most crucial types of transactions are specified as mandatory. To foster interoperability also in more complex scenarios, other types of transactions are specified as recommended or optional.</t>
