    <abstract>
      <t>The current IETF process has two types of RFCs: standards track documents and other RFCs (e.g., informational, experimental, FYIs). The intent of the standards track documents is clear, and culminates in an official Internet Standard. Informational RFCs can be published on a less formal basis, subject to the reasonable constraints of the RFC editor. Informational RFCs are not subject to peer review and carry no significance whatsoever within the IETF process.</t>
