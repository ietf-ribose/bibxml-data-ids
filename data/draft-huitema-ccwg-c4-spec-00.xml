    <abstract>
      <t>Christian's Congestion Control Code is a new congestion control algorithm designed to support Real-Time applications such as Media over QUIC. It is designed to drive towards low delays, with good support for the "application limited" behavior frequently found when using variable rate encoding, and with fast reaction to congestion to avoid the "priority inversion" happening when congestion control overestimates the available capacity. The design emphasizes simplicity and avoids making too many assumptions about the "model" of the network.</t>
