      <t>This document specifies extensions to the Service Location Protocolverson 2 (SLPv2) which allow applications residing in Mobile IPv6nodes to interact with SLPv2 agents in fixed networks. Each mobilenode contains a Visiting Agent which communicates with Access Agentsresiding in fixed networks. In networks already deployed with SLPv2-based service infrastructure, this allows applications in visitingmobile nodes to use SLPv2 and provide site-local services withoutneeding prior knowledge or static configuration of the networks theyvisit. By monitoring changes in Access Agent Advertisements,Visiting Agents can decide if the mobile node has moved to a newnetwork, and if it is necessary to rediscover and reregister site-local services. This document extends SLPv2 and the SLP API with newmessage types, error codes and function calls. Both C and Java APIbindings are provided.</t>
