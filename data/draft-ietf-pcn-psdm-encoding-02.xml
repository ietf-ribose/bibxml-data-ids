      <t>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a link-specific and load- dependent packet re-marking mechanism and provides in Differentiated Services networks feedback to egress nodes about load conditions within the domain. It is used to support admission control and flow termination decision in a simple way. This document proposes how PCN marks can be encoded into the IP header for packet-specific dual marking (PSDM). PSDM encoding provides three different codepoints: not-ETM, not-ThM, and PM. Excess-traffic-marking may re-mark not- ETM-packets to PM and threshold-marking may re-mark not-ThM-packets to PM.</t>
