    <abstract>
      <t>With the need to evolve the cryptography used in today applications, devices, and networks, there are many scenarios where the use of a single-algorithm is not sufficient. For example, there might be the need for migrating between two existing algorithms because of a weakening of earlier generations (e.g., from classic or traditional to post-quantum or quantum-safe). Another example might involve the need to test, instead, the capabilities of devices via test drivers and/or non-standard algorithms. Another very common case is the need to combine certified cryptography (e.g., FIPS) with newer algorithms that are not yet certified or that are not planned for certification. This work extends the options provided by Explicit Composite, defined in [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs], by providing a mechanism to manage backward and forward compatibility via k-of-n signature validation procedures. This document provides the definition of a new type of the kofn- CompositePublicKey and kofn-CompositeSignature which are aligned with the definitions of the respective structures for Explicit Composite [I-D.ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs].</t>
