      <t>Internet technical specifications often need to define a formatsyntax and are free to employ whatever notation their authorsdeem useful. Over the years, a modified version of Backus-NaurForm (BNF), called Augmented BNF (ABNF), has been popular amongmany Internet specifications. It balances compactness andsimplicity, with reasonable representational power. In the earlydays of the Arpanet, each specification contained its owndefinition of ABNF. This included the email specifications,RFC733 and then RFC822 which have come to be the common citationsfor defining ABNF. The current document separates out thatdefinition, to permit selective reference. Predictably, it alsoprovides some modifications and enhancements. The differences between standard BNF and ABNF involve namingrules, repetition, alternatives, order-independence, and valueranges. Appendix A (Core) supplies rule definitions and encodingfor a core lexical analyzer of the type common to severalInternet specifications. It is provided as a convenience and isotherwise separate from the meta language defined in the body ofthis document, and separate from its formal status.</t>
