    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes INT-path, a cost-effective network-wide telemetry framework based on INT(In-band Network Telemetry), by decoupling the network monitoring system into a routing mechanism and a routing path generation policy. INT-path embed SR(Source Routing) into INT probes to allow specifying the route that the probe packet takes through the network. Above this probing path control mechanism, an Euler trail-based path planning policy is developed to generate non-overlapped INT paths that cover the entire network with a minimum path member, reducing the overall telemetry overhead. INT- path is very suitable for deployment in data center networks thanks to their symmetric topologies.</t>
