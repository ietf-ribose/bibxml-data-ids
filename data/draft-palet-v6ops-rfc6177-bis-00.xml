      <t>The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) policies, have different views regarding the recommendation of the prefix to be assigned to end-sites. However, all them allow up to a /48 without further justification and clearly state that the exact choice of how much address space should be assigned to end-sites is a decision of each operator. In fact, the operational community has recently developed a document with also covers this topic "Best Current Operational Practice for Operators: IPv6 prefix assignment for end-users - persistent vs non-persistent, and what size to choose". This document reviews the architectural and operational considerations of end-site assignments, and reiterates that assignment policy and guidelines belong to the RIR community. This revision is being made to emphasize that IPv6 protocol evolution requires an ever increasing availability of subnets at the end-site and so, policy should reflect that assignment of a single subnet is no longer appropriate unless the recipient explicitly agrees to the limitations implied by such an assignment. This document obsoletes RFC6177 (IPv6 Address Assignment to End Sites).</t>
