      <t>This memo proposes an architecture for extending RTCP with a new RTCPXR (RFC3611) block type to report new metrics regarding mediatransmission or reception quality, as proposed indraft-ietf-avt-rtcp-guidelines (work in progress [replace with RFCnumber]). This memo suggests that a new block should contain asingle metric or a small number of metrics relevant to a singleparameter of interest or concern, rather than containing a number ofmetrics which attempt to provide full coverage of all thoseparameters of concern to a specific application. Applications maythen "mix and match" to create a set of blocks which covers their setof concerns. Where possible, a specific block should be designed tobe re-usable across more than one application, for example, for allof voice, streaming audio and video.</t>
