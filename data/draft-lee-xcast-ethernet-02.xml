      <t>Explicit multicast(Xcast)[XCST] is a new kind of Internet multicast and complements the Host Group Model multicast in the sense of multicast benefits. Xcast encodes addresses of destinations within its packet and requires neither any routing information exchange nor state management. Xcast routing utilizes legacy unicast routing information managed at every node and is expected to have performance good enough for small size multicast groups.</t>
