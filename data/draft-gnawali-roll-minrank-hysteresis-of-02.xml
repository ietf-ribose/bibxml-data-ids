      <t>Hysteresis delays the effect of changes in link metric on parentselection. Such delay makes the topology stable despite jitters inlink metrics. The Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks(RPL) allows the use of objective functions to construct routes thatoptimize or constrain a routing metric on the paths. Thisspecification describes the Minimum Rank Objective Function withHysteresis (MRHOF), an objective function that minimizes the noderank in terms of a given metric, while using hysteresis to preventexcessive rank churn. The use of MRHOF with RPL results in nodesselecting stable paths that minimize the given routing metric to theroots of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).</t>
