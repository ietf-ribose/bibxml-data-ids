    <abstract>
      <t>According to RFC7908 [RFC7908], Route leaks refer to case that the delivery range of route advertisements is beyond the expected range. For many current security protection solutions, the ISPs (Internet Service Providers) are focusing on finding ways to detect the happening of route leaks. However, the real-time route leak detection if any occurs is important as well. This document extends the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) [RFC7854] to provide a routing security scheme suitable for ISPs to detect BGP route leaks within their own networks.</t>
