    <abstract>
      <t>RFC 9370 specifies a framework that supports mulitple key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) by allowing up to 7 layers of additiona KEMs employed with the oringal ECDH to derive the final shared secret keys for IPsec protocols. The primitive goal is to mitigate the security threat against quantum computers by hybriding additional post-quantum (PQ) KEMs with the orinigal ECDH key exchange. This draft specifies how one QP KEMs, FrodoKEM, is instantiated in the IKEv2 as the additional KEMs with the main ECDH to achieve hybrid key agreement. [EDNOTE: IANA KE code points for FrodoKEM may need to be assigned, as the code points for ML-KEM has been considered in [I-D.D24]. ]</t>
