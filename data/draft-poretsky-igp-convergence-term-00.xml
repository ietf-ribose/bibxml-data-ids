      <t>This draft describes the terminology for benchmarking IGP Route Convergence. The motivation and applicability for this benchmarking is provided in [1]. The methodology to be used for this benchmarking is described in [2]. The methodology and terminology to be used for benchmarking route convergence can be applied to any link-state IGP such as ISIS [3] and OSPF [4]. The data plane is measured to obtain the convergence benchmarking metrics. The purpose of this document is to introduce new terms required to complete execution of the IGP Route Convergence Methodology [2].</t>
