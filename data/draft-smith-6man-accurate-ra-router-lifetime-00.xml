      <t>IPv6 Router Advertisements (RAs) have a "Router Lifetime" field, which specifies how long the advertising router will act as a default router for the receiving hosts, unless refreshed with another advertisement. The field name "Router Lifetime" is quite general, and could easily be misunderstood to mean the bounded lifetime of all of the information contained in the RA. This memo more accurately renames this field "Default Router Lifetime".</t>
