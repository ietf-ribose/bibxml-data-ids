    <abstract>
      <t>The ubiquitous presence of the internet coupled with the increasing demand for high bandwidth dedicated large scale network has made it imperative that the multi-domain networks are facilitated by the development of GMPLS. In such large scale network, the high performance network survivability is a significant factor to resist the fault service discontinue and interruption even to decrease economic loss and the society impact. This document proposes a series of network survivability evaluation metrics and methodologies that can be used to demonstrate the network survivability performance in single and multi-domain GMPLS networks, more specifically, the network fault restoration performance.</t>
