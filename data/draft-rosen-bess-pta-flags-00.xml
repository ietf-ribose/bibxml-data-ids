      <t>RFC6514 defines the "P-Multicast Service Interface Tunnel (PMSI Tunnel) attribute". This attribute contains an octet of "flags". Only one flag is defined in that RFC, but there is now a need to define additional flags. Since the RFC did not create a registry for the assignment of flag bits, this document updates the RFC by creating a registry for that purpose.</t>
