      <t>The current IETF standard-track maturity level definitions, includingthe assumption that most specification of successful protocols wouldadvance rapidly to Internet Standard, the never-used automaticexpiration mechanism, and the STD nnnn designation, have not workedwell. Users of IETF Standards have found it difficult to determinewhat standards were associated with others in groups, the actualstatus of specifications within a related group, and the level ofinteroperability testing and deployment and use for any givenstandard or set of features. The community has rarely used the"requirement level" mechanism in recent years. There is now anerrata mechanism for published RFCs, but the errata lists do notprovide authoritative, consensus-based, corrections to standards-track documents. This document suggests that all of those issues aresymptoms of a single system of interrelated issues and problems andproposes an integrated solution.</t>
