      <t>At the time the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee was set up the Internet Architecture Board had an internal structure significantly different from its current structure. This document aims to update the ex officio member from the IAB who serves on the IAOC in order to better account for that change and better match the skills set out in RFC 4333.</t>
