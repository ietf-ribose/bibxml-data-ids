      <t>In this note a number of PCE architectural and computational options are evaluated against a medium sized wavelength switched optical network. The key performance measures of overall and backward blocking are reported under different dynamic traffic scenarios. The corresponding reduction in connection blocking probabilities and computational advantages enabled by these architectural alternatives strongly warrant their inclusion in continuing PCE WSON work.</t>
