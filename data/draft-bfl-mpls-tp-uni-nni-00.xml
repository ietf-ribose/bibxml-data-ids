      <t>The framework for MPLS in transport networks [RFC5921] provides reference models for an MPLS-TP User-to-Network Interface (UNI), and an MPLS-TP Network-to-Network interface (NNI). This document updates those reference models to show detailed reference points for these interfaces, along with further clarification of the functional architecture of MPLS-TP at a UNI and NNI. This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T. This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETF Consensus before publication as an RFC and will be subjet to an IETF Last Call. [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published RFC has IETF onsensus.]</t>
