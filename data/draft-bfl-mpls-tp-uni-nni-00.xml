      <t>The framework for MPLS in transport networks [RFC5921] providesreference models for an MPLS-TP User-to-Network Interface (UNI), andan MPLS-TP Network-to-Network interface (NNI). This document updatesthose reference models to show detailed reference points for theseinterfaces, along with further clarification of the functionalarchitecture of MPLS-TP at a UNI and NNI.This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunication Union TelecommunicationStandardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS TransportProfile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge(PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalitiesof a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETFConsensus before publication as an RFC and will be subjet to an IETFLast Call.[RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC andinsert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the publishedRFC has IETF onsensus.]</t>
