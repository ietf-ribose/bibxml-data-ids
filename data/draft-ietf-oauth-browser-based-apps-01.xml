      <t>OAuth 2.0 authorization requests from browser-based apps must be made using the authorization code grant with the PKCE extension, and should not be issued a client secret when registered. This specification details the security considerations that must be taken into account when developing browser-based applications, as well as best practices for how they can securely implement OAuth 2.0.</t>
