      <t>Neighbor Discovery (RFC4861) is used by IPv6 nodes to determine the link-layer addresses of neighboring nodes as well as to discover and maintain reachability information. This document updates RFC4861 to allow routers to proactively create a Neighbor Cache entry when a new IPv6 address is assigned to a node. It also updates RFC4861 and recommends nodes to send unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements upon assigning a new IPv6 address. The proposed change will minimize the delay and packet loss when a node initiates connections to an off- link destination from a new IPv6 address.</t>
