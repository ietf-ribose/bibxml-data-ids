      <t>IEEE 802.1 has specified Continuity Fault Management (CFM) OAM facilities. CFM messages are structured with an Op-Code field and have provision for the inclusion of TLV (type, length, value) structured information. IEEE 802.1 has allocated blocks of CFM Op- Codes and TLV Types to the IETF. This document specifies the IANA Consideration for the assignment of values from these blocks.
