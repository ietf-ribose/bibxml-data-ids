      <t>This document describes updated processes for defining and implementing policies regarding the RFC Series as a whole and thus specifies version 3 of RFC Editor Model. As specified here, the model divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into two high- level tasks. Policy definition is the responsibility of the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), which produces policy proposals that are subject to approval by the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB). Policy implementation is primarily the responsibility of the RFC Production Center (RPC), under the ultimate authority of the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC). This document obsoletes RFC 8728.</t>
