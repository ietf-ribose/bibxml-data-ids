      <t>For the evaluation of network designs it is desirable to express their complexity in objective, measurable metrics. Previous work has shown that a large number of distinct, partly dependent scales play a role in overall complexity. This document proposes the use of multi- scale entropy metrics to describe the complexity of a network. We observe that the complexity of a network which undergoes no changes over a longer time period is constant. Conversely, when a network undergoes changes entropy is increasing; this is independent on whether the changes make the network more or less complex. In other words, also a simplification effort increases complexity temporarily.</t>
