      <t>A straightforward approach to provide protection against packet losses due to network outages with a longest duration of T time units is to simply duplicate the original packets and send each copy separated in time by at least T time units. This approach is commonly referred to as Time-shifted Redundancy, Temporal Redundancy or simply Delayed Duplication. This document defines an attribute to indicate the presence of temporally redundant media streams and the duplication delay in the Session Description Protocol.</t>
