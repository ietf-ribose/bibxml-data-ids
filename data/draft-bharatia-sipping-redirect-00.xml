      <t>SIP is selected as a session control protocol for many VOIP applications. Hence it should provide capabilities for supporting such redirection-based services as automatic call distribution for call centers, third-party voicemail, follow-me service etc. The concept of Call Redirection is implicit in the capabilities already defined for SIP Proxies and Clients.</t>
