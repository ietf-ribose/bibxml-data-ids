    <abstract>
      <t>This draft specifies a Hotspot Mitigation Protocol (HMP) for mobile ad hoc networks that use on-demand routing protocols and the IEEE 802.11 MAC. Hotspots represent transient but highly congested regions in wireless ad hoc networks that result in increased packet loss, end-to-end delay, and out-of-order packets delivery. Using HMP, mobile nodes independently monitor local conditions (e.g., buffer occupancy, packet loss, and MAC contention and delay) in a fully distributed manner, and take local actions in response to the emergence of hotspots, such as, suppressing new route requests and rate controlling TCP flows. As a result, HMP improves end-to-end throughput, delay, and packet loss, balances the resource consumption among neighboring nodes, and finally, improves the network connectivity by preventing premature network partitions.</t>
