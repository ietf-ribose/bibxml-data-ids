      <t>The Internet Message Format originally formally specified in RFC 561 has been extended in some ways and for some purposes which have posed difficulties for some desirable operations such as digitally signed messages, have led to clutter in message content which in turn has led user agent implementers to suppress display of some originator message content, leading in some cases to user confusion, surprise, and embarrassment. This memo is part of a multi-document series that specifies an extensible message format which is intended to facilitate operations hampered by extensions to the current format and to reduce clutter in the user-to-user message content. This memo will present a brief history of the Internet Message Format evolution, will identify problems caused by changes that have been made, and will introduce terminology and concepts that will be used in other documents in the series.</t>
