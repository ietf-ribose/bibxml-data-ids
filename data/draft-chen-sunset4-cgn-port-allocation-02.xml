      <t>The document enumerates methods of port assignment in CGN contexts, more focusing on a NAT64 environment. The analysis categorizes the different methods with several key features. The uses of existing protocols are further described corresponding to those features. This memo also states the port-usage experiences, relevant findings, evaluations and workarounds. It's expected the document could provide an informative base line to help operators choosing a proper method.</t>
