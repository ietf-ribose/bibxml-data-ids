      <t>There will be IPv4-only applications that remain in use as networkmanagers begin deploying IPv6-only networks, or turning off IPv4 inthe exiting dual-stack networks. These applications require a dual-stack capable host operating system, but that OS may find that thelocal network has not provided on-link IPv4 provisioning or routingsupport for the resulting packets. Skepticism that this situationwill exist is widespread; because it is easy to ignore the costssomeone else will incur and focus on the local situation. Taking thesystem level viewpoint, that skepticism makes no sense when it iswidely acknowledged that people will resist replacing something thatis working, particularly when the reason it might artificially stopis due to 'someone else's problem'. The reality of IPv4-onlyapplications persisting in an IPv6-only provisioned network isspecifically ignored by RFC 4038. This document deals with thesituation by defining a new tunneling type for use within the edge orleaf network to the border where it interconnects with an IPv4routing domain.The draft is being discussed on the ipv6@ietf.org list.LegalThis documents and the information contained therein are provided onan "AS IS" basis and THE CONTRIBUTOR, THE ORGANIZATION HE/SHEREPRESENTS OR IS SPONSORED BY (IF ANY), THE INTERNET SOCIETY, THEIETF TRUST AND THE INTERNET ENGINEERING TASK FORCE DISCLAIM ALLWARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANYWARRANTY THAT THE USE OF THE INFORMATION THEREIN WILL NOT INFRINGEANY RIGHTS OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESSFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</t>
