      <t>A Mobile IPv6 node needs a home address, a home agent address and asecurity association with its home agent. One of the currentchallenge is to dynamically provide these information to the MobileNode. This problem is known as the Mobile IPv6 Bootstrappingproblem. A solution for this is to rely on the AAA infrastructure toprovide the Home Agent Information to the Network Access server(NAS). Then the Mobile Node uses DHCPv6 to get this information.This document provides a way for the Mobile Node to get the HomeAgent information by using the PANA protocol instead of DHCPv6.Before the authentication phase, the PANA Authentication Agent (PAA)indicates to the PANA Client (PaC) that it can provide him with theHome Agent Information. According to the PANA client's response,after the authentication and authorization phase with the AAAinfrastructure, the PAA will send this information to the PaC.</t>
