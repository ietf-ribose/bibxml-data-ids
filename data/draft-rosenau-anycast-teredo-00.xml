      <t>Because of the shortage of remaining IPv4 addresses you have to expect that in a near time there will be IPv6-only services in the internet (such as web servers). Because many internet service providers do not support IPv6, yet, there is the need of a reliable translation mechanism so customers only having access to IPv4 only can access IPv6 services. This document describes a translation mechanism which is similar to the Teredo protocol [RFC4380]. However this protocol is based on anycast addressing and should also work with symmetric NATs.</t>
