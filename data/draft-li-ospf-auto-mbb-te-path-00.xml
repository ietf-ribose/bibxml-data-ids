      <t>As the network scale expands, especially in the mobile backhaul network, automatic computation of MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE) path becomes very important. But owing to requirements on the MPLS TE path, explicit path or affinity property has to be introduced for the path computation. This causes the complexity of MPLS TE path design. The document proposes an architecture and corresponding OSPF extensions to improve automation on computation of MPLS TE path. MPLS TE networks are divided into different traffic engineering layers and areas according to the characteristics of the network topology. MPLS TE path can compute automatically based on traffic engineering layers and areas to satisfy major requirements to bear mobile network services.</t>
