      <t>This document defines the format of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) identifying news messages and groups. The syntax of 'news' URLs from RFC 1738 is extended to allow specification of the site from which the message is to be sought and to incorporate protections via 'snews' URLs. This combines into the 'news' scheme enough capability so that the previously-proposed 'nntp' scheme can be retired and URL usage simplified.</t>
