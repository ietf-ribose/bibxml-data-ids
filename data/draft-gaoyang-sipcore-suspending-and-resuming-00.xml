      <t>RFC3312 &amp; 4032 has defined semantics of suspending and resuming for session establishment. But suspending and resuming for session modification needs clarification, especially for modification with part of the streams with precondition. This text just aims for giving out some use case for further analysis. And if we need do some standard track for this issue, IMO, the "Re-INVITE Handling" draft can be more proper and systematic.</t>
