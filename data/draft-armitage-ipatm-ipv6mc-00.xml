      <t>The Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipatm-ipmc-05.txt ('Support for Multicast over UNI 3.1 based ATM Networks') describes a mechanism for handling IP multicast over ATM. Whilst the architecture is intended to support multiple protocols such as IP, IPX, AppleTalk, etc, the current examples apply only to IPv4 environments. This document describes the specific encodings that should be used when running IPv6 over ATM. It is expected that some of this text will influence the revision of draft-ietf-ipatm-ipmc-05.txt or become a separate companion document in its own right.</t>
