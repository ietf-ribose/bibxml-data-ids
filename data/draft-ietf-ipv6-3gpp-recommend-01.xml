      <t>This document contains recommendations from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) IPv6 Working Group to the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) community regarding the use of IPv6 in the 3GPP standards. Specifically, this document recommends that the 3GPP: 1. Specify that multiple prefixes may be assigned to each primary PDP context, 2. Require that a given prefix must not be assigned to more than one primary PDP context, and 3. Allow 3GPP nodes to use multiple identifiers within those prefixes, including randomly generated identifiers. The IPv6 Working Group supports the use of IPv6 within 3GPP and offers these recommendations in a spirit of open cooperation between the IPv6 Working Group and the 3GPP community. Since the original publication of this document as an Internet-Draft, the 3GPP has adopted the primary recommendations of this document.</t>
