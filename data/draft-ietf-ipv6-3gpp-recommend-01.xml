      <t>This document contains recommendations from the InternetEngineering Task Force (IETF) IPv6 Working Group to the ThirdGeneration Partnership Project (3GPP) community regarding the useof IPv6 in the 3GPP standards. Specifically, this documentrecommends that the 3GPP:1. Specify that multiple prefixes may be assigned to eachprimary PDP context,2. Require that a given prefix must not be assigned to morethan one primary PDP context, and3. Allow 3GPP nodes to use multiple identifiers within thoseprefixes, including randomly generated identifiers.The IPv6 Working Group supports the use of IPv6 within 3GPP andoffers these recommendations in a spirit of open cooperationbetween the IPv6 Working Group and the 3GPP community. Since theoriginal publication of this document as an Internet-Draft, the3GPP has adopted the primary recommendations of this document.</t>
