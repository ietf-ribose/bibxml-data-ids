      <t>The Dynamic DNS Update Protocol assumes that the devices/applications performing dynamic registration of the DNS records will delete the records from the DNS database when the records become invalid. Initial deployment of the devices supporting the Dynamic DNS Update protocol indicated that there are multiple legitimate scenarios when records dynamically registered in DNS are not removed from the database by the devices that originally registered them. This can result in a substantial number of stale records. This document describes a mechanism to clean up these stale records.</t>
