      <t>This document describes the framework to support a new protocol forexplicit congestion notification (ECN), termed re-ECN, which can bedeployed incrementally around unmodified routers. Re-ECN allowsaccurate congestion monitoring throughout the network thus enablingthe upstream party at any trust boundary in the internetwork to beheld responsible for the congestion they cause, or allow to becaused. So, networks can introduce straightforward accountabilityfor congestion and policing mechanisms for incoming traffic from end-customers or from neighbouring network domains. As well as givingthe motivation for re-ECN this document also gives examples ofmechanisms that can use the protocol to ensure data sources respondcorrectly to congestion. And it describes example mechanisms thatensure the dominant selfish strategy of both network domains and end-points will be to use the protocol honestly.</t>
