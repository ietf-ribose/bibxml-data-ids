      <t>This document revisits the end-to-end argument by re-deriving its premises under contemporary operational conditions. Rather than treating "end-to-end" as a slogan about host-to-host reachability, it examines how the original argument defines an endpoint in functional and administrative terms, and evaluates whether those assumptions continue to hold in modern networks.</t>
