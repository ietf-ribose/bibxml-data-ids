    <abstract>
      <t>Segment Routing (SR) [SR-ARCH] is a new MPLS paradigm in which each SR-capable router is required to independently advertise global MPLS labels for its attached prefixes using IGP [SR-ISIS-EXT][SR-OSPF-EXT]. One major challenge associated with such label advertisement mechanism is how to avoid a given global MPLS label from being allocated by different routers to different prefixes. Although manual allocation can address such label allocation collision problem, it is error-prone and therefore may not be suitable for large SR network environments. This document proposes an alternative approach for advertising global labels without any risk of label allocation collision.</t>
