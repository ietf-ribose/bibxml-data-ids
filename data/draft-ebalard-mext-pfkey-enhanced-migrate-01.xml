      <t>This document describes the need for an interface between Mobile IPv6and IPsec/IKE and shows how the two protocols can interwork. Anextension of the PF_KEY framework is proposed which allows smooth andsolid operation of IPsec/IKE in a Mobile IPv6 environment.This document is heavily based on a previous draft [MIGRATE] writtenby Shinta Sugimoto, Masahide Nakamura and Francis Dupont. It simplyreuses the MIGRATE mechanism defined in the expired document, removesa companion extension (SADB_X_EXT_PACKET) based on implementationfeedback (complexity, limitations, ...) and fills the gap by verysimple changes to MIGRATE mechanism. This results in a more simpleand consistent mechanism, which also proved to be easier toimplement. This document is expected to serve as a continuation of[MIGRATE] work. For that reason, the name of the extension has beenkept.PF_KEY MIGRATE message serves as a carrier for updated informationfor both the in-kernel IPsec structures (Security Policy Database /Security Association Database) and those maintained by the keymanagers. This includes in-kernel Security Policy / SecurityAssociation endpoints, key manager maintained equivalents, andaddresses used by IKE_SA (current and to be negotiated). Theextension is helpful for assuring smooth interworking between MobileIPv6 and IPsec/IKE for the bootstrapping of mobile nodes and theirmovements.</t>
