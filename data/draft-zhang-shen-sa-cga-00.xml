      <t>This memo describes an approach to negotiate ESP SA when both sides are using CGAs as IP address. The solution provides as an alternate solution of IKE when CGAs are available. One round of message exchanges is described in order to take place of the initial exchanges of IKEv2 or the phase 1 exchange of IKE. A new IPv6 extension header, CGA extension header, is described in order to carry CGA related payloads.</t>
