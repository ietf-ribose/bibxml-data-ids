      <t>This draft proposes that the Internet Society should take a formal role in the oversight and licensing of competitive registries for the international Internet name space, in support of the IANA and with the assistance of the IAB. Although this draft has been discussed in various bodies, it is not final, it should not be regarded as a consensus document, and it is presented for open debate in the Internet community.</t>
