      <t>The Bidirectional Web Transfer Protocol (BWTP) is an application- level protocol that can be used to upgrade a HTTP/1.1 connection, as defined by [RFC2616] to a bidirectional channel capable of exchanging messages. It is intended that BWTP can be used as a transport protocol for the HTML 5 Websocket API, as well as for other uses.</t>
