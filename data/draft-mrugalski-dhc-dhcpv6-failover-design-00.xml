      <t>DHCPv6 defined in [RFC3315] does not offer server redundancy. This document defines a design for DHCPv6 failover, a mechanism for running two servers on the same network with capability for either server to take over clients' leases in case of server failure or network partition. This is a DHCPv6 Failover design document, it is not protocol specification document. It is a second document in a planned series of three documents. DHCPv6 failover requirements are specified in [requirements]. A protocol specification document is planned to follow this document.</t>
