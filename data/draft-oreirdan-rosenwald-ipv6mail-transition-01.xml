    <abstract>
      <t>This document contains a phased plan for how providers of email services can effect and manage the transition of email services from IPv4 to IPv6. It is expected that this will be effected over a period of years and it is unlikely that any transition will completely exclude the ongoing possibility of using IPv4 as a transport mechanism for email. This provides one possible implementation plan for transitioning email services on the Internet from a predominantly IPv4-based connectivity model that suports IPv6.</t>
