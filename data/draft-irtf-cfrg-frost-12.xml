    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold (FROST) signing protocol. FROST signatures can be issued after a threshold number of entities cooperate to compute a signature, allowing for improved distribution of trust and redundancy with respect to a secret key. FROST depends only on a prime-order group and cryptographic hash function. This document specifies a number of ciphersuites to instantiate FROST using different prime- order groups and hash functions. One such ciphersuite can be used to produce signatures that can be verified with an Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA, as defined in RFC8032) compliant verifier. However, unlike EdDSA, the signatures produced by FROST are not deterministic. This document is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG) in the IRTF.</t>
