      <t>Mail Divide Framework (MDF) is a recipient driven partitioning framework for E-Mail delivery. A protocol to divide mail delivery at the source of the message is defined in this draft. A mechanism called Reputation Service Provider is also introduced so that a third-party authority can assure senders' trust. With MDF, subdomaining is used for category-specific MTA designation. Senders decide which category the outgoing mail belongs. It then looks up DNS TXT record to find whether the recipient advertises a specific server for that category. The specified server puts the received mail into a corresponding per-category inbox for the user.</t>
