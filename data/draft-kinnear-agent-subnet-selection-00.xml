      <t>In RFC2131, the giaddr specifies both the subnet on which a DHCP client resides as well as an IP address which can be used to communicate with the relay agent. The subnet selection option allows these functions of the giaddr to be split so that when one entity is performing as a DHCP proxy, it can specify the subnet from which to allocate an IP address which is different from the IP address with which it desires to communicate with the DHCP server.</t>
