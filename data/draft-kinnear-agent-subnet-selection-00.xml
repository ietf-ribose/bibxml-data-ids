      <t>In RFC2131, the giaddr specifies both the subnet on which a DHCPclient resides as well as an IP address which can be used tocommunicate with the relay agent. The subnet selection option allowsthese functions of the giaddr to be split so that when one entity isperforming as a DHCP proxy, it can specify the subnet from which toallocate an IP address which is different from the IP address withwhich it desires to communicate with the DHCP server.</t>
