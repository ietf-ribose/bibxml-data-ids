      <t>This document specifies a profile of the System for Cross-Domain Identity Management Protocol (SCIM). Servers which implement protocols such as SAML or OpenID Connect receive user identities through those protocols and often cache them, and this profile of SCIM defines how an identity provider can notify a SCIM server of changes to user accounts.</t>
