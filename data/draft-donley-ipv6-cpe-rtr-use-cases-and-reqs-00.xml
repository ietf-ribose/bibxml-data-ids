    <abstract>
      <t>This document captures use cases and associated requirements for an IPv6 Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) router. Specifically, the current version of this document focuses on the provisioning of an IPv6 CPE router and the provisioning of IPv6 Home Devices attached to it. It also addresses IPv6 traffic forwarding and IPv6 CPE Router security. This document also identifies areas for future consideration. These areas include prefix sub-delegation, IPv6 multicast, transition and tunneling mechanisms, provisioning consistency between DHCPv4 and DHCPv6, and DNS support. This document does not address IPv4 use cases or requirements, as they are widely understood; however, it is expected that IPv6 CPE Routers will also support IPv4.</t>
