      <t>In confidential computing, device assignment (DA) is the method by which a device (e.g., network adapter, GPU), whether on-chip or behind a PCIe Root Port, is assigned to a Trusted Virtual Machine (TVM). For the TVM to trust an assigned device, the device must provide the TVM with attestation Evidence confirming its identity and the state of its firmware and configuration. Since Evidence claims can be processed by 3rd party entities (e.g., Verifiers, Relying Parties) external to the TVM, there is a need to standardize the representation of DA-related information in Evidence to ensure interoperability. This document defines an attestation Evidence format for DA as an EAT (Entity Attestation Token) profile.</t>
