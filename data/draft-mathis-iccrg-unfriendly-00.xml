      <t>The current Internet fairness paradigm mandates that all protocolshave equivalent response to packet loss, such that relatively simplenetwork devices can attain a weak form of fairness by sending uniformsignals to all flows. This "TCP-friendly" paradigm has been thepolicy of the IETF for nearly two decades. Although it was only aninformal policy in the beginning, it progressively became more formalfollowing the publication of RFC 2001 in 1997.However we observe two trends that differ from this policy: anincreasing number of environments where applications and othercircumstances create situations that are "unfair", and ISPs that areresponding to these situation by imposing traffic control in thenetwork itself.This note explores the question of whether TCP-friendly paradigm isstill appropriate for the huge breadth of technology and scaleencompassed by today's global Internet. It considers the merits anddifficulties of changing IETF policy to embrace these changes byprogressively moving the responsibility for capacity allocation fromthe end-system to the network. Ultimately this policy change mighteliminate or redefine the requirement that all protocols be "TCP-Friendly".This note is intended foster discussion in the community andeventually become input to the IESG and IAB, where it might evolveinto a future architecture statement.</t>
