      <t>In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) need carrying necessary measurement information in the packet while the packet transverses a path between two points in the network to mark the packet. The Alternate-Marking is a kind of marking method and is presented in RFC 8321, Alternate-Marking Method for Passive and Hybrid Performance Monitoring, and RFC 8889, Multipoint Alternate- Marking Method for Passive and Hybrid Performance Monitoring. This document describes how to deploy in-situ flow performance measurement based on Alternate-Marking method in IPv6 domain.</t>
