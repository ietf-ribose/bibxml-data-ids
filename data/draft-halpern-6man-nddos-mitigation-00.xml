      <t>It has been observed that with the large space of IPv6 addresses within a subnet, remote attackers can send packets that saturate a rotuers ND cache, and potentially saturate a subnet with ND Soliciation messages as well. Some operational techniques and small protocol adjustments have been proposed that can help alleviate this problem. This draft proposes a slightly more drastic optional behavior for routers, which can nearly eliminate this problem.</t>
