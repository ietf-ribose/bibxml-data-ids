    <abstract>
      <t>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) is defined in multiple RFCs for enabling communication between Path Computation Elements (PCEs) and Path Computation Clients (PCCs). Although PCEP defines various Label Switched Path (LSP) identifiers, attributes, and constraints, there are operational attributes available on the PCC that can enhance path computation and improve the debugging experience, which are not currently supported in PCEP. This document proposes extensions to PCEP to include: * Support for explicit or dynamic path types * Mechanisms to mark LSPs as eligible for use as transit LSPs These extensions aim to address the existing gaps, enhancing the overall functionality and operational efficiency of PCEP.</t>
