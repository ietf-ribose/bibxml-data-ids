    <abstract>
      <t>The Node Potential Oriented Multi-Nexthop Routing Protocol (NP-MNRP) bases on the idea of "hop-by-hop routing forwarding, multi-backup next hop" and combines with the phenomena that water flows from higher place to lower. NP-MNRP defines a metric named as node potential, which is based on hop count and the actual link bandwidth, and calculates multiple next-hops through the potential difference between the nodes.</t>
