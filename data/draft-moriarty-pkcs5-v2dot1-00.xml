      <t>This document provides recommendations for the implementation of password-based cryptography, covering key derivation functions, encryption schemes, message-authentication schemes, and ASN.1 syntax identifying the techniques. The recommendations are intended for general application within computer and communications systems, and as such include a fair amount of flexibility. They are particularly intended for the protection of sensitive information such as private keys, as in PKCS #8. It is expected that application standards and implementation profiles based on these specifications may include additional constraints. Other cryptographic techniques based on passwords, such as password- based-key entity authentication and key establishment protocols are outside the scope of this document. Guidelines for the selection of passwords are also outside the scope. This document represents a republication of PKCS #5 v2.1 from RSA Laboratories' Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) series. By publishing this RFC, change control is transferred to the IETF.</t>
