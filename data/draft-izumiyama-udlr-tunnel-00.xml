      <t>Since digital multichannel TV broadcasting services have been started in many areas, low cost digital data receivers are available. They can be used for not only TV broadcasting service but also any kind of data communication services. A low cost receiver can receive high bandwidth traffic from a feed, while no bandwidth from the receiver to the feed is provided. Therefore the connection between the feed and the receiver is unidirectional. Current routing protocols stand on a fact that any links are bidirectional even if the bandwidth in each direction may be different. They can not handle unidirectional links. This document defines an idea to use unidirectional links (UDLs) routing without any modifications of current routing protocols.</t>
