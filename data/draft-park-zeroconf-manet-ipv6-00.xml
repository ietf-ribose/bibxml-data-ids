      <t>The concept of IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration (SAA) lendsitself easily to a mobile ad hoc network where no administrativeconfigurations are available. However, the SAA designed to operateon a single link is not directly applicable to the mobile ad hocnetwork with multi-hop paths. In this document, we extend thecurrent SAA to overcome this limitation by using the IPv6 site-local address.</t>
