    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes two new TCP mechanisms that can be used to more effectively recover lost segments when a connection's congestion window is small, or when a large number of segments are lost in a single transmission window. The first of these mechanisms, 'Limited Transmit', calls for sending a new data segment in response to each of the first two duplicate acknowledgments that arrive at the sender. The second mechanism is to reduce, in certain special circumstances, the number of duplicate acknowledgments required to trigger a fast retransmission.</t>
