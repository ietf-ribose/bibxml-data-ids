      <t>The document describes a network design architecture for routing packets via different paths available in the network based on application port number. Primarily, this is targeted for Enterprise customers who have built up redundancy at their WAN edge but are suffering from a congested primary link whilst the secondary is idle. The objective of this architecture is as follows 1) Offload bulky application on to the secondary link 2) Achieve the above with out introducing asymmetric routing in the network</t>
