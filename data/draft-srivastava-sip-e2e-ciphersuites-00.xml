      <t>The security mechanism currently offered by SIP is essentially hop- by-hop and not end-to-end. The current SIP specification doesn't guarantee that a specific level of security (encryption, digest etc) is employed at each hop. This version of the draft outlines the solution broadly. As the solution progresses, it will have exact details in the subsequent versions.</t>
