      <t>This document defines and formalizes the concept of stackable pseudo- mechanisms, and associated concept of composite mechanisms, for the Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface (GSS-API), as well as several utility functions. Stackable GSS-API pseudo-mechanisms allow for the composition of new mechanisms that combine features from multiple mechanisms. Stackable mechanisms that add support for Perfect Forward Security (PFS), data compression, additional authentication factors, etc... are facilitated by this document.</t>
