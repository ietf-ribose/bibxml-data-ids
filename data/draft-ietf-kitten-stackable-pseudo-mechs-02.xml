      <t>This document defines and formalizes the concept of stackable pseudo-mechanisms, and associated concept of composite mechanisms, for theGeneric Security Service Application Programming Interface (GSS-API),as well as several utility functions.Stackable GSS-API pseudo-mechanisms allow for the composition of newmechanisms that combine features from multiple mechanisms. Stackablemechanisms that add support for Perfect Forward Security (PFS), datacompression, additional authentication factors, etc... arefacilitated by this document.</t>
