      <t>This memo describes the message and procedure related to the Multicast Announce and Control Protocol (MACP). This protocol is considered as one 'building blocks' of a reliable multicast transport framework. The Multicast Announce and Control Protocol (MACP) organizes the process by which a multicast sender node (Msender) manages transmissions to dynamic groups of receivers (Mreceivers) in the 'one-to-many' model. The prime objective of MACP is to work in conjunction with various data transport protocols in order to meet various network requirements. One other main objective is to provide a unified announce transport mechanism for both bulk data transfer and streamed data.</t>
