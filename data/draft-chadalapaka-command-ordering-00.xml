      <t>iSCSI is a SCSI transport protocol designed to run on top of TCP. The iSCSI session abstraction is equivalent to the SCSI I_T nexus, and the iSCSI session provides an ordered command delivery from the SCSI initiator to the SCSI target. This document goes into the design considerations that led to the iSCSI session model as it is defined today, relates the SCSI command ordering features defined in T10 specifications to the iSCSI concepts, and finally provides guidance to system designers on how true command ordering solutions can be built based on iSCSI.</t>
