      <t>This document sets policy for the inclusion of characters in the definitive versions and publication formats of RFCs. The policy for the RFC Series is that all displayable text is allowed as long as there is a high expectation that readers of an RFC will be able to interpret its text as intended. This document obsoletes RFC 7997. [[ A repository for this draft can be found here (https://github.com/ paulehoffman/7997bis). ]]</t>
