    <abstract>
      <t>Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) provides means for network applications to obtain network information. In the definitions of ALTO services ([RFC7285] and existing extensions), there is no requirement on whether the source and the destination endpoints must belong to the same autonomous network, which is a single-domain setting, or they can belong to different autonomous networks, which is a multi-domain setting. This document explains problems of realizing ALTO in multi-domain settings and then presents 3 potential solutions to realize ALTO multi-domain services.</t>
