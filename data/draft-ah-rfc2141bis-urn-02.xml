      <t>Uniform Resource Names (URNs) are intended to serve as persistent,location-independent, resource identifiers. This document serves asthe foundation of the 'urn' URI Scheme according to RFC 3986 and setsforward the canonical syntax for URNs, which subdivides URNs into"namespaces". A discussion of both existing legacy and newnamespaces and requirements for URN presentation and transmission arepresented. Finally, there is a discussion of URN equivalence and howto determine it. This document supersedes RFC 2141.The requirements and procedures for URN Namespace registrationdocuments are currently set forth in RFC 3406, which is also expectedto be updated by an independent, revised specification.DiscussionThis draft version has been obtained by importing the text from RFC2141 into modern tools and making a first round of updating steps.It is intended to serve as one of the starting points for an effortto bring URN RFCs in alignment with STD 63, STD 68, BCP 26, and therequirements from emerging distributed national and international URNresolution systems, and advance them on the IETF Standards Track.Comments are welcome on the urn@ietf.org mailing list (or sent to thedocument editor).</t>
