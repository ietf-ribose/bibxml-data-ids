      <t>Provider-Provisioned Virtual Private Network (PPVPN)[RFC4110] usessome forms of IP tunneling schemes to tunnel VPN traffic. Possiblecandidates are GRE, IP-in-IP, IPsec and MPLS. The candidatetunneling scheme should provide multiplexing capability, as well asdynamic tunnel setup and maintenance capability. Additionally,security is required if the VPN traffic is traversing public Internetor across Service Provider domains. Each above candidate by itselfis not sufficient to meet all these requirements. This documentdescribes a method of using IPsec signaling (i.e, IKE) to setup a GREtunnel. This IPsec GRE tunnel may be used as the candidate tunnelingscheme in PPVPN network or remote access compulsory VPN. Thisdocument also defines a way how the Key field in GRE header is usedin IPsec GRE tunnel setup.</t>
