      <t>This document deprecates some previously specified Key Exchange Method algorithm names as well as defining a few added Modular Exponential (MODP) Groups for the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. It also updates [RFC4253], [RFC4419], [RFC4462], and [RFC5656] by specifying the set key exchange algorithms that currently exist and which ones MUST, SHOULD, MAY, and SHOULD NOT be implemented. New key exchange methods use the SHA-2 family of hashes.</t>
