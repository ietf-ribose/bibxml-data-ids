      <t>Using multiple care-of address registration, there is a possibilitythat a malicious mobile node could create multiple care-of addressbindings that does not belong to the mobile node at its home agent.The home agent would accept these bindings without verifying them dueto the trust relationship it has with the mobile node. With thesebindings, the mobile node can launch attacks by asking the home agentto flood the victims of these care-of addresses with useless packets.To mitigate such a problem, this memo introduces a few possibleverification mechanisms that the home agent would use in order toverify the care-of addresses for the mobile node before using themfor packet routing.</t>
