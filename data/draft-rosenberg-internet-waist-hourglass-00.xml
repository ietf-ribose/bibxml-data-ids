      <t>One of the fundamental design principles of the Internet is that IPrepresents a common intermediate protocol layer, linking together avariety of link layer technologies underneath with a large number ofapplications on top. When drawn graphically, this can be show as anhourglass with IP in the middle.

This document discusses thischange and describes its implications for protocol and applicationdesign.</t>
