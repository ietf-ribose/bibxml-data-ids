    <abstract>
      <t>Forward-RTO recovery (F-RTO) specified in RFC 4138 is an algorithm for detecting a spurious retransmission timeout with TCP and SCTP. This document describes the advantages of F-RTO and summarizes the experience in its implementations and the experiments conducted with it. By analyzing the implications of the spurious retransmission timeouts on the regular RTO recovery and Forward-RTO recovery algorithm, including a detailed corner case analysis, it shows that F-RTO does not have negative impact on the network when used with an appropriate response algorithm even in the rare cases where F-RTO falsely declares a retransmission timeout spurious. It concludes with a recommendation that F-RTO is to be advanced to the standards track.</t>
