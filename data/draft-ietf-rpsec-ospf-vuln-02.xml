      <t>Internet infrastructure protocols were designed at the very earlystages of computer networks when "cyberspace" was still perceived asa benign environment. As a consequence, malicious attacks were notconsidered to be a major risk when these protocols were designed,leaving today's Internet vulnerable. This paper provides an analysisof OSPF vulnerabilities that could be exploited to modify the normalrouting process across a single domain together with an assessment ofwhen internal OSPF mechanisms can or cannot be leveraged to bettersecure a domain.</t>
