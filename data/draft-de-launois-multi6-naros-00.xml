    <abstract>
      <t>More and more ISPs are multihomed and need to engineer their interdomain traffic. Unfortunately, both multihoming and traffic engineering contribute to the growth of the BGP routing tables. For IPv6, a better solution for multihoming and traffic engineering is required. This document proposes a host-centric IPv6 multihoming solution that relies on the utilization of a 'Name, Address and ROute System' (NAROS) server. A key advantage of using this server is that it allows a multihomed site to engineer its interdomain traffic without transmitting any BGP message.</t>
