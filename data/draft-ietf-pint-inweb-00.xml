      <t>This memo is submitted as input to the draft PINT (PSTN and Internet Internetworking) Informational RFC. This document describes an internetworking architecture of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) and the Internet based on the Lucent prototype. This architecture enables access to PSTN services from the Internet. The four basic PSTN services that could be made available to an Internet User are described. We have used the World Wide Web as an example to show how these PSTN services can be seamlessly integrated into the Internet. Next a Service Support Transport Protocol for reliable transfer of service request from the Internet to the PSTN network is described. A simple Management Information Base (MIB) that is used for uploading information and performing authentication checks is then described.</t>
