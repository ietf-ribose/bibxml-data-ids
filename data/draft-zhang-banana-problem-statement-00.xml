    <abstract>
      <t>Bandwidth aggregation for Internet access can increase the access bandwidth and reliability. It has become a desirable network function, especially for those Service Providers who operates multiple heterogeneous networks. This document describes the issues with bandwidth aggregation for Internet access. The required network functions to be supported are specified. Several candidate solutions had been considered to support bandwidth aggregation for Internet access in IETF. These techniques are investigated.</t>
