      <t>Some ASes currently use length-based filters to manage the size ofthe routing table they use and propagate. This draft explores analternative to length-based filters which allows for more automaticconfiguration and which provides for better redundancy.Rather than use a filter, this draft proposes a method of modifyingthe BGP [RFC1771] longest match algorithm by setting a bound on theprefix lengths eligible for preference. A bound would operate onlong prefixes when covering route announcements are available; incertain circumstances it would cause a router to prefer an aggregateover a more specific route announcement.</t>
