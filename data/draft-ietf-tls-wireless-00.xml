      <t>This document suggests extensions to TLS designed to make TLS more amenable to use within wireless environments. The extensions may beused by TLS clients and servers. The extensions are backwardscompatible - communication is possible between TLS 1.0 clientsthat support the extensions and TLS 1.0 servers that do notsupport the extensions, and vice versa.</t>
