      <t>This document describes operational information for deploying multicast network with link layer tunneling mechanism which defined in [RFC3077]. RFC3077 defines the mechanism which allows a operator to integrate unidirectional link(e.g. satellite link etc..) into the network transparently. In some multicast network configuration, a certain configuration for unidirectional link are necessary. This document clarifies the problem that exist when a operator use a multicast routing protocol with link layer tunneling mechanism. It also describes how to solve those problem with short term solutions and also long term solutions. This document does not define any new protocol.</t>
