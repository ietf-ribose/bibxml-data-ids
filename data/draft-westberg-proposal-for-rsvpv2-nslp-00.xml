      <t>The Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVPv1) has been on the standards track within the IETF for a number of years. During that time, the level of vendor support and deployment has been relatively slow, despite the demand for technologies offering services with different levels of quality of service to their customers. This memo seeks to initiate a dialog about the design of a new version of RSVPv1, called RSVPv2, that meet the requirements formulated by IETF NSIS working group. It also outlines the motivation for using RSVP2 as 'next step in signaling'. The RSVPv2 framework uses the layer-split architecture separating signaling application and transport functions. This concept was adopted by NSIS WG and the two layers are called NSLP NSIS Signaling Layer Protocol (NSLP) and NSIS Transport Layer Protocol (NTLP). This draft provides design guidelines and specifications for the development of the RSVPv2 NSLP part. RSVP2-NSLP offers increased modularity and contains less mandatory objects compared to RSVPv1, which allow lightweight implementation and flexible application. The new protocol is extended with PHR and PDR objects that makes it possible to use the protocol in different part of multi-domain networks and use the protocol in DiffServ environment.</t>
