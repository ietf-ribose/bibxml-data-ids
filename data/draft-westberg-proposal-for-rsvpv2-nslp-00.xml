      <t>The Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVPv1) has been on the standardstrack within the IETF for a number of years. During that time, thelevel of vendor support and deployment has been relatively slow,despite the demand for technologies offering services with differentlevels of quality of service to their customers. This memo seeks toinitiate a dialog about the design of a new version of RSVPv1, calledRSVPv2, that meet the requirements formulated by IETF NSIS workinggroup. It also outlines the motivation for using RSVP2 as 'next stepin signaling'.The RSVPv2 framework uses the layer-split architecture separatingsignaling application and transport functions. This concept wasadopted by NSIS WG and the two layers are called NSLP NSIS SignalingLayer Protocol (NSLP) and NSIS Transport Layer Protocol (NTLP). Thisdraft provides design guidelines and specifications for thedevelopment of the RSVPv2 NSLP part.RSVP2-NSLP offers increased modularity and contains less mandatoryobjects compared to RSVPv1, which allow lightweight implementationand flexible application. The new protocol is extended with PHR andPDR objects that makes it possible to use the protocol in differentpart of multi-domain networks and use the protocol in DiffServenvironment.</t>
