      <t>This document describes a simple extension of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) format that allows preferred transport mechanisms, including protocols, ports and interfaces, to be specified as parseable additions to the scheme name. This explicit configuration is beneficial for separation of the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) from underlying transports, which has been increasingly recognised as useful when a variety of ways of transporting or configuring use of HTTP are available and a choice of mechanism to use must be indicated.</t>
