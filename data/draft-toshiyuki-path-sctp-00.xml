      <t>Although SCTP provides multihoming function, a single point offailure may occur due to its lack of source address selection.RFC2960 describes that 'a host should pick the most divergent source-destination pair.' But, it also describes that selecting sourceaddress is implementation matter. In RFC3257, Coene et al. haveclaimed that a host must take careful in selectiong its sourceaddress. In this document, we propose a way of outgoing interfaceselection and its corresponding source address selection in SCTP.</t>
