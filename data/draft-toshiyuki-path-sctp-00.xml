      <t>Although SCTP provides multihoming function, a single point of failure may occur due to its lack of source address selection. RFC2960 describes that 'a host should pick the most divergent source- destination pair.' But, it also describes that selecting source address is implementation matter. In RFC3257, Coene et al. have claimed that a host must take careful in selectiong its source address. In this document, we propose a way of outgoing interface selection and its corresponding source address selection in SCTP.</t>
