      <t>OAM functions are essential to ensure that the desired service levelof traffic engineered connections are met. In certain technologiesOAM entities are inherently established once the connection is setup. However other technologies, especially OAM for packet switchednetworks, require an extra configuration step after connectionestablishment to setup OAM entities. This document specifiesextensions to RSVP-TE to support the establishment and configurationof OAM entities along with LSP signalling.Requirements LanguageThe key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in</t>
