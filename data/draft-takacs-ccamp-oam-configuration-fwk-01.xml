      <t>OAM functions are essential to ensure that the desired service level of traffic engineered connections are met. In certain technologies OAM entities are inherently established once the connection is set up. However other technologies, especially OAM for packet switched networks, require an extra configuration step after connection establishment to setup OAM entities. This document specifies extensions to RSVP-TE to support the establishment and configuration of OAM entities along with LSP signalling.Requirements Language The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in</t>
