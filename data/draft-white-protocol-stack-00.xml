      <t>The NETBLT protocol [RFC998] was designed as an experimental transport layer protocol, intended for moving large quantities of data across a wide variety of networks. It provides reliable bulk transfer with an end-to-end flow-control mechanism meant to deal with network congestion by throttling the rate at which data is inserted into the network. However, experiments with NETBLT across shared links revealed problems with fairness; traffic from one connection could hog most of a link's bandwidth, and there seems to be no way to prevent this under the current rate-control scheme, so further application of NETBLT was not pursued by its original developers. However, NETBLT has a number of characteristics which make it very attractive for use across noisy, long-delay, slow-turnaround, or asymmetric communications links. Such links are common in military usage, and may become more widespread with the development of mobile computing. NETBLT's attractive characteristics include selective retransmission of lost packets, potentially large transmission windows, and control of transmission from the receiving, rather than the sending side; the latter makes NETBLT relatively insensitive to network delays.
