      <t>After a CR-LSP is set up, its bandwidth reservation may need to be changed by the network operator, due to the new requirements for the traffic carried on that CR-LSP [2]. This contribution presents an approach to modify the bandwidth and possibly other parameters of an established CR-LSP using CR-LDP [3] without service interruption. The LSP modification feature can be supported by CR-LDP with a minor extension of an _action indicator flag_. This feature has application in dynamic network resources management where traffic of different priorities and service classes is involved.</t>
