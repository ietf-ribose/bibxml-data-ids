    <abstract>
      <t>This memo introduces an architecture, called IP-ERN, which allows Explicit Rate Notification (ERN) protocols to be inter-operable with current IP-based networks. IP-ERN is based on the execution of both End-to-End (E2E) and ERN protocols at the end hosts. The resulting E2E-ERN protocol provides inter and intra protocol fairness and benefits from all ERN advantages when possible. We detail the principle of this novel architecture, which is compliant with every TCP feature, as well as IP-in-IP tunneling solutions. In particular, IP-ERN is an alternative to splitting Performance Enhancement Proxies.</t>
