      <t>Constrained IoT devices often operate more efficiently in a loosely coupled environment without maintaining end-to-end connectivity between nodes. Information Centric Networking naturally supports this demand by replicated data distribution and hop wise forwarding. This document outlines a deployment option for NDN in low-power and lossy networks (LLNs) that follows a publish-subscribe pattern. The proposed protocol scheme simplifies name-based routing significantly and facilitates even large off-duty cycles for constrained nodes.</t>
