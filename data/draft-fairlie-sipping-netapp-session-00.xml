      <t>This document defines a framework for using Session Initiation Protocol sessions to create user interface components for network application interaction. These Network Applications Sessions provide a number of services to the application server and user agent including application identification, co-operation, association, and authentication. In addition to these services the framework allows for differing modes of interaction to be managed in a homogenous manner with similar expectations for security, establishment, update, closure and the handling of certain user interface operations.</t>
