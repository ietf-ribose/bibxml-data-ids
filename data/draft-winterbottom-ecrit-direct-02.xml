      <t>The specified IETF emergency services architecture puts a strongemphasis on emergency call and emergency messaging via the VoiceService Provider (VSP) / Application Service Provider (ASP). Thereare two reasons for this design decision: The call routing via theVSP/ASP is more natural as it follows the standard communicationpattern and transition deployments assume non-updated end hosts.As the deployment of the Location-to-Service Translation protocolprogresses there are possibilities for upgraded end devices todirectly communicate with the IP-based emergency services networkwithout the need to interact with a VSP/ASP, which simplifies thetask of regulators as the involved parties are within the samejurisdiction.This memo describes the procedures and operations of a genericemergency calling client utilizing the available building blocks.</t>
