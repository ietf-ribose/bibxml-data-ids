      <t>The specified IETF emergency services architecture puts a strong emphasis on emergency call and emergency messaging via the Voice Service Provider (VSP) / Application Service Provider (ASP). There are two reasons for this design decision: The call routing via the VSP/ASP is more natural as it follows the standard communication pattern and transition deployments assume non-updated end hosts. As the deployment of the Location-to-Service Translation protocol progresses there are possibilities for upgraded end devices to directly communicate with the IP-based emergency services network without the need to interact with a VSP/ASP, which simplifies the task of regulators as the involved parties are within the same jurisdiction. This memo describes the procedures and operations of a generic emergency calling client utilizing the available building blocks.</t>
