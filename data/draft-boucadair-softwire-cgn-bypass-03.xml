      <t>This document proposes a solution to avoid the use of two stateful DS-Lite AFTR devices when both end-points are located behind different AFTR devices. For this purpose a new IPv6 extension header, called Tunnel Endpoint Extension Header (TEEH), is defined. The proposed procedure encourages the use of IPv6 between DS-Lite AFTR nodes as a means to avoid the unnecessary crossing of AFTR devices. A Flow Label based solution is also described.</t>
