      <t>This document proposes a solution to avoid the use of two statefulDS-Lite AFTR devices when both end-points are located behinddifferent AFTR devices. For this purpose a new IPv6 extensionheader, called Tunnel Endpoint Extension Header (TEEH), is defined.The proposed procedure encourages the use of IPv6 between DS-LiteAFTR nodes as a means to avoid the unnecessary crossing of AFTRdevices. A Flow Label based solution is also described.</t>
