    <abstract>
      <t>The main purpose of URNs is to serve as persistent resource identifiers, where each URN may potentially need to be usable for several decades. A primary goal of the URN framework is to provide a mechanism whereby a URN can be resolvable for many decades, while still allowing the resolution services for that URN to be provided by the parties responsible for maintenance of the information about that URN. The Uniform Resource Name framework abstract description is proposed as a means of handling URN identifiers in modular layers of information management. From the standpoint of the bearer of a URN, this means that much of the underlying support for a given URN or collection may change without disrupting the identification capacities of the URN.</t>
