    <abstract>
      <t>To enable automated network OAM (Operations, administration and management), the availability of network protocol running status information is a fundamental step. In this document, a network monitoring protocol (NMP) is proposed to provision the information related to running status of IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol) and other control protocols. It can facilitate the network troubleshooting of control protocols in a network domain. Typical network issues are illustrated as the usecases of NMP for ISIS to showcase the necessity of NMP. Then the operations and the message formats of NMP for ISIS are defined. In this document ISIS is used as the illustration protocol, and the case of OSPF and other control protocols will be included in the future version.</t>
