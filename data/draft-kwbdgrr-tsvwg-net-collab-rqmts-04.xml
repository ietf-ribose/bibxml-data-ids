      <t>Collaborative signaling from host-to-network (i.e., client-to-network and server-to-network) can improve the user experience by informing the network about the nature and relative importance of packets (frames, streams, etc.) without having to disclose the content of the packets. Moreover, the collaborative signaling may be enabled so that clients and servers are aware of the network's treatment of incoming packets. Also, client-to-network collaboration can be put in place without revealing the identity of the remote servers. This collaboration allows for differentiated services at the network (e.g., packet discard preference), the sender (e.g., adaptive transmission), or through cooperation of server/client and the network. This document lists some use cases that illustrate the need for a mechanism to share metadata and outlines host-to-network requirements. The document focuses on signaling information about a UDP transport flow (UDP 4-tuple).</t>
