      <t>This document describes the "regex" extension to the Sieve email filtering language. In some cases, it is desirable to have a string matching mechanism which is more powerful than a simple exact match, a substring match or a glob-style wildcard match. The regular expression matching mechanism defined in this draft provides users with much more powerful string matching capabilities. Change History (to be removed prior to publication as an RFC) Changes from draft-murchison-sieve-regex-08: o Updated to XML source. o Documented interaction with variables. Changes from draft-ietf-sieve-regex-00: o Various cleanup and updates. o Added trial text specifying comparator interactions. Open Issues (to be removed prior to publication as an RFC) o The major open issue with this draft is what to do, if anything, about localization/internationalization. Are [IEEE.1003-2.1992] collating sequences and character equivalents sufficient? Should we reference the Unicode technical specification? Should we punt and publish the document as experimental? o Is the current approach to comparator integration the right one to use? o Should we allow shorthands such as \\b (word boundary) and \\w (word character)? o Should we allow backreferences (useful for matching double words, etc.)?</t>
