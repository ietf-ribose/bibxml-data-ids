      <t>This document describes the "regex" extension to the Sieve emailfiltering language. In some cases, it is desirable to have a stringmatching mechanism which is more powerful than a simple exact match,a substring match or a glob-style wildcard match. The regularexpression matching mechanism defined in this draft provides userswith much more powerful string matching capabilities.Change History (to be removed prior to publication as an RFC)Changes from draft-murchison-sieve-regex-08:o Updated to XML source.o Documented interaction with variables.Changes from draft-ietf-sieve-regex-00:o Various cleanup and updates.o Added trial text specifying comparator interactions.Open Issues (to be removed prior to publication as an RFC)o The major open issue with this draft is what to do, if anything,about localization/internationalization. Are [IEEE.1003-2.1992]collating sequences and character equivalents sufficient? Shouldwe reference the Unicode technical specification? Should we puntand publish the document as experimental?o Is the current approach to comparator integration the right one touse?o Should we allow shorthands such as \\b (word boundary) and \\w(word character)?o Should we allow backreferences (useful for matching double words,etc.)?</t>
