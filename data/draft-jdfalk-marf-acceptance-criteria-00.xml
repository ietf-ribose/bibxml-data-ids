      <t>All known Feedback Generators (the operators of complaint feedback loops) have some criteria for acceptance of requests to receive feedback. This document is a review of such criteria, where publicly available. It is intended to inform design decisions within the Mail Abuse Reporting Format (MARF) Working Group [MARF-WG], and likely will never advance beyond internet-draft status. The information included herein was gathered from public web sites.</t>
