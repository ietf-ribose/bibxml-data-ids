      <t>Network service providers are increasingly moving from providingjust Internet connectivity to offering intermediary-based servicesand performance optimizations to enhance end user experience atreduced costs. These services and optimizations are being, orwill be, offered with the help of intermediate nodes placed in theservice provider network between communicating end-points. Inthis document, we list several intermediary-based transportservices and performance optimization mechanisms that are being(or could be) provided by the intermediate nodes, and identify therequirements of any solution that securely offers these servicesand mechanisms.</t>
