      <t>Network service providers are increasingly moving from providing just Internet connectivity to offering intermediary-based services and performance optimizations to enhance end user experience at reduced costs. These services and optimizations are being, or will be, offered with the help of intermediate nodes placed in the service provider network between communicating end-points. In this document, we list several intermediary-based transport services and performance optimization mechanisms that are being (or could be) provided by the intermediate nodes, and identify the requirements of any solution that securely offers these services and mechanisms.</t>
