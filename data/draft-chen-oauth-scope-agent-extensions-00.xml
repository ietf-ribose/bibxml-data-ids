    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines an extension to the OAuth 2.0 scope parameter, as specified in RFC 6749, which is used to express the permissions granted to an access token. The proposed extension introduces a structured syntax for scope values to enable fine- grained authorization for the installation and execution of Modular Capability Units (encapsulated and reusable functional modules such as skills) within Agent ecosystems. However, current mechanisms for authorizing such modules generally lack a standardized way to express and obtain consent for the complex, fine-grained permissions they require during installation. This document addresses this limitation by defining a structured format for the scope parameter. The format extends the simple space- delimited strings with a colon-separated syntax: [resource_type]:[action]:[target][:constraints]. This syntax allows for the precise description of permissions for operations such as file system access, command-line execution, network access, tool invocation, and scheduled tasks. These extensions provide a standardized, machine-readable way to request, convey, and validate detailed permissions, thereby enhancing users' security control over their resources while maintaining compatibility with the existing OAuth token issuance and validation flows.</t>
