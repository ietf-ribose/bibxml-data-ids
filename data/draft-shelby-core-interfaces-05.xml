      <t>This document defines well-known REST interface descriptions for Batch, Sensor, Parameter and Actuator types for use in contrained web servers using the CoRE Link Format. A short reference is provided for each type that can be efficiently included in the interface description attribute of the CoRE Link Format. These descriptions are intended to be for general use in resource designs or for inclusion in more specific interface profiles. In addition, this document defines the concepts of Function Set and Binding. The former is the basis element to create RESTful profiles and the latter helps the configuration of links between resources located on one or more endpoints.</t>
