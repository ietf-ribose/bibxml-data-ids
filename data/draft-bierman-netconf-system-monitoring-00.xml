      <t>The NETCONF protocol provides mechanisms to manipulate configurationdatastores. However, client applications often need to examinesystem information to determine the appropriate configurationrequirements. In addition, common system events such as a change insystem capabilities may impact management applications. Standardmechanisms are needed to support the monitoring of the managed systemsupported by a NETCONF server. This document defines a YANG modulefor the monitoring of system information, which allows a NETCONFclient to identify system properties and receive notifications forsystem events.</t>
