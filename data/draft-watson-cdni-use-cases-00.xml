      <t>[draft-jenkins-cdni-problem-statement] outlines the problem space for CDN Interconnection within the IETF. This documents provides a complimentary set of technical use cases for how CDNs may be interconnected. The goal of this document is to outline real world use-cases for CDN Interconnect, for the IETF, with the intention of supporting the case for formation of a Working Group which would work on the definition of standardised, interoperable methods of Interconnecting CDNs. The goal of this document is NOT to define the technical solutions to be used. The intent of this document is to outline a set of technical use cases. While the technical use cases may be influenced by business- related and other non-technical factors, this document does not attempt to detail any non-technical aspects of CDN Interconnect.</t>
