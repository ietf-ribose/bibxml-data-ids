    <abstract>
      <t>We define a well-known URI at which an HTTP origin can inform an authoritative DNS server, or other interested parties, about its Service Bindings. The data can include Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) configurations, allowing the origin, in collaboration with DNS infrastructure elements, to publish and rotate its own ECH keys. Note This note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC. The source for this draft is in https://github.com/sftcd/wkesni/ Issues and PRs are welcome there too.</t>
