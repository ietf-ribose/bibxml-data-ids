      <t>Logically Succinct Basic Policy Rule Components (LSBPRC) provides model extensions to the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) and implementable extensions to the Policy Core LDAP Schema (PCLS) in which the logic of conditions and actions can be succinctly expressed and explicitly interpreted. LSBPRC offers a direct and invariant connection between the rule designer's intention and the rule interpreter's evaluation of the rulebase.</t>
