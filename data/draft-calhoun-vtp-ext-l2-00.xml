      <t>The VTP Protocol specification defines a generic tunneling mechanism, as well as extensions for IP and IPX protocols. This specification will detail a method to establish Level 2 (PPP and SLIP) tunnels between two peers. This strawman proposal is intended as a recommendation for using VTP as a generic all-purpose tunnel scheme, as opposed to having multiple tunneling mechanism for layer 2 and 3 protocols.</t>
