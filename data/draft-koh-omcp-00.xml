      <t>This document describes Overlay Multicast Control Protocol (OMCP)used for realizing and managing Overlay Multicast, as also known asApplication Layer Multicast. Overlay Multicast is a data deliveryscheme for multicast applications, in which one or more intermediaterelay agents are employed for relaying application data from a senderto many receivers along a pre-configured or automatically configuredtree hierarchy. In OMCP, a special- purpose entity, called SessionManager, is used to manage and control the tree configuration andsession monitoring. OMCP is designed to ensure that the multicastapplications and services can be provided over current Internetenvironments in which IP multicast has not completely been deployed.</t>
