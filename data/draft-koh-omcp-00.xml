      <t>This document describes Overlay Multicast Control Protocol (OMCP) used for realizing and managing Overlay Multicast, as also known as Application Layer Multicast. Overlay Multicast is a data delivery scheme for multicast applications, in which one or more intermediate relay agents are employed for relaying application data from a sender to many receivers along a pre-configured or automatically configured tree hierarchy. In OMCP, a special- purpose entity, called Session Manager, is used to manage and control the tree configuration and session monitoring. OMCP is designed to ensure that the multicast applications and services can be provided over current Internet environments in which IP multicast has not completely been deployed.</t>
