      <t>The BOOTP [1] or the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) [2] provide a framework for booting a host over a network from a remote server. This document defines a new option which a BOOTP/DHCP client may include in its BOOTP request or DHCPDISCOVER message. In their replies, the recipient servers may include this option along with the location/path information to a file ('boot.info') in the option field. The client may use the contents of this file to select the desired OS with which to boot along with the location/path of the appropriate boot image file.</t>
