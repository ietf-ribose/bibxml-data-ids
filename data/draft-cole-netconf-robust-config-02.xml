      <t>This document extends the capabilities of the NETCONF configurationmanagement protocol in order to standardize mechanisms to performsets of active tests (i.e., verification) against servers' runningconfiguration over a period of time to afford the client and server amore robust and resilient configuration management capability. Thisis of value to commercial enterprise and public networks as well aswireless emergency and military networks. We accomplish this throughthe definition of the new verify.yang module. Servers supportingthis module will advertise this capability according to the YANGspecification. We also explore the future alternatives fordeveloping these capabilities within the context of the existingNETCONF protocol, the YANG modeling language and existing relatedIETF, IEEE and ITU-T standards.</t>
