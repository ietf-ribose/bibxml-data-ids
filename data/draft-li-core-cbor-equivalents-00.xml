    <abstract>
      <t>JSON (RFC7159) is a text-based data format which is popular for Web based data exchanges. CBOR (RFC7049) is a binary data format which has been optimized for data exchanges for the Internet of Things. For many IoT scenarios, CBOR formats will be preferred since it can decrease transmission payload sizes compared to other data formats. This specification defines an approach for translating JSON objects, which are relevant for the CoRE WG and its related specifications, into CBOR format. Where applicable, mapping from other formats into JSON or CBOR is also described.</t>
