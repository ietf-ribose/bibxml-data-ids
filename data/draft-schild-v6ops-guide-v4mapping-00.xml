      <t>This document is intended to be a guide for network administrators of enterprise sized sites that employ the Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) and who would like to introduce the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) dual-stack. It applies to scenarios where IPv4 subnets must be mapped to IPv6 subnets for management purposes while keeping the option to create IPv6 subnets in parallel and independently in the future with almost no restrictions; it is not meant to be applied to scenarios where a native IPv6 address plan can be created easily and without the need to map IPv4 subnets.</t>
