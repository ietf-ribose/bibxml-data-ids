      <t>This document is intended to be a guide for network administrators ofenterprise sized sites that employ the Internet Protocol Version 4(IPv4) and who would like to introduce the Internet Protocol Version6 (IPv6) dual-stack. It applies to scenarios where IPv4 subnets mustbe mapped to IPv6 subnets for management purposes while keeping theoption to create IPv6 subnets in parallel and independently in thefuture with almost no restrictions; it is not meant to be applied toscenarios where a native IPv6 address plan can be created easily andwithout the need to map IPv4 subnets.</t>
