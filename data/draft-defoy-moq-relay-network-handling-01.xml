      <t>This document describes a mechanism to convey information about media frames. The information is used for specific handling in functions such as error recovery and congestion handling. These functions can be critical to improve energy efficiency and network capacity in some (especially wireless) networks. Due to end-to-end encryption, MOQ relays are expected to extract the metadata required by these functions. This document aims to enable a level of wireless network support for MOQ equivalent to what is possible for RTP.</t>
