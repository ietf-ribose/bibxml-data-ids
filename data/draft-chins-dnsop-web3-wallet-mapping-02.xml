      <t>This document proposes a implementation standard for mapping wallets to domain names using the new WALLET RRType, allowing for TXT record fallback while the WALLET RRType propagates through DNS providers. The goal is to provide a secure and scalable and unbiased way to associate wallets with domain names, enabling seamless lookup as well as suggesting required authentication mechanism. The proposal relies on DNSSEC or security successors to ensure trust and security.</t>
