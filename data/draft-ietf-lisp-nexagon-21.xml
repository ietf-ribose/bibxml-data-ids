    <abstract>
      <t>Geolocation-Services aggregate raw data uploads from vehicles using mobility edge compute locations and process these uploads to verified,localized, geospatial detection-channels. Geospatial detection channels are used by mobility clients in vehicles and in the cloud to support aspects of Mobility use-cases: i. Crowd-sourced mapping of lanes, markings, and signage ii. Intelligent Driving heads-up notifications on hazards, blockages, and connivances such as parking or charging on the driving route. The allocation of Geolocation Services is dynamic and adjusted to road activity and number of active vehicles. This dynamics combined with the dynamics of vehicles mobile-access IP Anchors creates coherency, context-switching, geo-privacy, and service continuity key issues. These issues are resolved by dataflow virtualization, or communication indirection, between mobility clients in vehicles and Geolocation Services. LISP overlay network-virtualization [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis] offers a mobility-network solution. Such a LISP mobility-network deployment is described in this document.</t>
