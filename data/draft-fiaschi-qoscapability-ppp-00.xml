    <abstract>
      <t>Quality of Service in the IP protocol has been proposed in some service definitions (Int-Serv and Diff-Serv) and in a variety of schemes and supporting protocols (RSVP). These schemes assume, of course, that all the protocols supporting IP links in turn provide a well-defined degree of QoS the IP schemes can rely upon. One of the most common link protocols is PPP. The PPP protocol provides a standard method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. It was designed to be used in serial point-to-point links. These ones can be for example PSTN circuits, characterized by a fixed bandwidth and fixed delay. Hence, there was no need to specify QoS mechanisms for PPP: the IP layer (or more generally the network layer) did not take into account the data-link layer to calculate the available resources.</t>
