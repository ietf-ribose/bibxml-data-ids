      <t>In a variety of conferencing scenarios, a local communication channelis desirable for conference-related information exchange between co-located but otherwise independent application entities, for examplethose taking part in application sessions that belong to the sameconference. In loosely coupled conferences such a mechanism allowsfor coordination of applications entities to e.g. implementsynchronization between media streams or to configure entitieswithout user interaction. It can also be used to implement tightlycoupled conferences enabling a conference controller to enforceconference wide control within a end system.This document defines application scenarios and requirements for acoordination infrastructure that provides local coordination within aconferencing end system.This document is intended for discussion in the Multiparty MultimediaSession Control (MMUSIC) working group of the Internet EngineeringTask Force. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to theworking group's mailing list at confctrl@isi.edu and/or the authors.</t>
