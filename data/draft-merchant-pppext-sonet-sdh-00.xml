    <abstract>
      <t>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard mechanism for transport of multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. There is currently significant interest and activity in transporting PPP over SONET links, and RFC 1619 [2] and RFC 1662 [3], both from 1994, have so far provided most of the basis for implementation of such a transport. Recent needs, proposals and standards have recently progressed beyond these two RFCs, as well as identified limitations of the methods described in the aforementioned RFCs for effective implementation at very high data rates in the vicinity of 10 Gb/s (STS-192c/OC-192). This document (A) attempts to consolidates (sometimes by reference) current standards and current practice in transport of PPP over SONET; (B) attempts to document current viewpoints that share some degree of consensus in recent developments in this area and (C) proposes for STS-192c/OC-192 transmission a simple, efficient and robust 32-bit-word-oriented framing mechanism based on HDLC, called HDLC-32, which is significantly more conducive to efficient implementation at high data rates in the vicinity of 10 Gb/s (STS-192c/OC-192) than the HDLC framing currently used at lower rates.</t>
