      <t>This document describes a transport independent, request-responseprotocol for the management of trust anchors and communityidentifiers stored in a device. The protocol makes use of theCryptographic Message Syntax (CMS), and a digital signature is usedto provide integrity protection and data origin authentication. Eachtrust anchor is associated with a list of functions within devicesthat make use of digital signature mechanisms. Digital signaturescan be validated directly with the public key associated with thetrust anchor, or they can be validated with a certified public keywhose X.509 certification path terminates with the trust anchorpublic key.</t>
