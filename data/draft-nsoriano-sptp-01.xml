      <t>This document presents a protocol intended to transfer the whole contents of a disk partition (or the whole directory tree placed under a given directory on the disk) to a backup server. The protocol lies on top of TCP or other stream-oriented transport protocol, and is based on the exchange of messages between the client (the host sending data) and the server (the host storing the received data).</t>
