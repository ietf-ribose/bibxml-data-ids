      <t>This document describes a SCITT-based mechanism for creating verifiable records of AI content refusal events. It defines how refusal decisions can be encoded as SCITT Signed Statements, registered with Transparency Services, and verified by third parties using Receipts. This specification provides auditability of refusal decisions that are logged, not cryptographic proof that no unlogged generation occurred. It does not define content moderation policies, classification criteria, or what AI systems should refuse; it addresses only the audit trail mechanism.</t>
