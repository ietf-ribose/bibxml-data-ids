      <t>Conventional Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) impose several challenges on factory floors as their numbers and size on the factory floors/plants continues to grow. Virtualized PLCs can help overcome many of those concerns. They can improve the automation in Industry control networks by simplifying communication between higher-level applications and low-level factory floor machine operations. Virtual PLCs provide an opportunity to integrate a diverse set of non- internet protocols supporting Industrial-IoT and IP connections to improve coordination between applications and field devices. Besides automation, virtual PLCs also enhance programmability in industry process control systems by abstracting control functions from I/O modules. However, to achieve desired outcome and benefits, both operational and application networks should evolve. This document introduces virtual PLC concept, describes the details and benefits of virtualized PLCs, then focuses on the problem statement and requirements.</t>
