    <abstract>
      <t>TLS 1.3 ensures forward secrecy by performing an ephemeral Diffie- Hellman key exchange during the initial handshake, protecting past communications even if a party's long-term keys are later compromised. While the built-in KeyUpdate mechanism allows traffic keys to be refreshed during a session, it does not introduce new forward-secret key material. This limitation can pose a security risk in long-lived sessions, such as those found in industrial IoT or telecommunications environments. To address this, this specification defines an extended key update mechanism that performs a fresh Diffie-Hellman exchange within an active session, thereby re-establishing forward secrecy beyond the initial handshake. By forcing attackers to exfiltrate new key material repeatedly, this approach mitigates the risks associated with static key compromise. Regular renewal of session keys helps contain the impact of such compromises. The extension is applicable to both TLS 1.3 and DTLS 1.3.</t>
