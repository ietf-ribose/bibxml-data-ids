This document provides a one-time interpretation of the eligibility rules that is required for the exceptional situation of the cancellation of the in-person IETF 107 meeting. This document only affects the seating of the 2020-2021 NomCom and any rules that relate to NomCom eligibility or process before IETF 108, and does not set a precedent for the future.</t>
