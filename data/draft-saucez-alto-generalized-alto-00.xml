      <t>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) problem is beingdiscussed within the IETF and more globally by the research communityand some enterprises. In this memo, we argue that it is important toconceive general-purpose mechanisms to solve this problem. Bygeneral-purpose we say not only application independent but alsolayer independent mechanism. The generality can be obtained becausethe underlying problem is the same regardless the application or thelayer.</t>
