      <t>RFC 6374 describes methods of making loss and delay measurements on Label Switched Paths (LSPs) primarily as used in MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) networks. This document describes a method of extending RFC 6374 performance measurements from flows carried over MPLS-TP to flows carried over generic MPLS LSPs. In particular, it extends the technique to allow loss and delay measurements to be made on multi-point to point LSPs and introduces some additional techniques to allow more sophisticated measurements to be made in both MPLS-TP and generic MPLS networks.</t>
