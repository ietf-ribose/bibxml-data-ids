    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies rules for email addresses that are flexible enough to express the addresses typically used with SMTPUTF8, while avoiding confusing or risky elements. This is one of a pair of documents: this contains recommendations for what addresses humans should use, such address provisioning sytems can restrain themselves to addresses that email valdidators accept. (This set can also be described in other ways, including "simple to cut-and-paste".) Its companion defines simpler rules, accepts more addresses, and is intended for software like MTAs. NOTE: The term 'nice' is not ideal here, and must be reconsidered or replaced before this is issued as an RFC. "Well-formed" is a candidate. "Nice" will do for now: better to argue about substance than wording.</t>
