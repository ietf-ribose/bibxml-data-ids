    <abstract>
      <t>Telecommunications (Telecom) networks are important infrastructure. 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) provides security specifications for telecom networks, including network devices and user terminals. Meanwhile, the security protocols from IETF widely used in telecom systems. In the docuemnt, we present some post- quantum risks and assessments that exist in current telecom network based on the sepcifiction. From the perspective of RFC, this document analyzes possible post-quantum migration cases and potential strategy in typical telecom network scenarios. The strategy includes the suggestion of related IETF protocols and profiles, which can also provide guidance for other similar communication systems.</t>
