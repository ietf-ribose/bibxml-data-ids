      <t>This Internet Draft describes some extensions to the Post Office Protocol [POP3] and are described here for historical purposes. The status of this Internet Draft will be Historic. [XTND] describes a mechanism to extend the POP3 protocol, called XTND. Two extensions which have been implemented on some server implementations are XTND XMIT and XTND XLST; this memo describes these extensions. New implementations of POP3 clients and servers are not expected to implement these extensions; other mechanisms should be used instead. For example, [SMTP] should be used instead of XTND XMIT for sending email. If authentication is needed for sending email, then the proposed [ESMTP] [AUTH] extension should be used.</t>
