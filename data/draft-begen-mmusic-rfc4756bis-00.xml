      <t>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) supports grouping media lines.SDP also has semantics defined for grouping the associated source andForward Error Correction (FEC)-based repair flows. However, thesemantics that were defined in RFC 4756 generally fail to provide thespecific grouping relationships between the source and repair flowswhen there are more than one source and/or repair flows in the samegroup. Furthermore, the existing semantics also do not supportadditive repair flows and prioritization among the repair flowsprotecting one or more source flows. This document addresses theseissues by introducing new FEC grouping semantics.</t>
