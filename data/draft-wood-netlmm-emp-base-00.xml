      <t>This document specifies a protocol for localized mobility management which allows the mobile node to keep using the same IP address while it is in the same localized mobility management domain. The protocol enables the edge mobility anchor point to manage the routing path for the mobile node in the domain, so that the packet form the correspondent node can be delivered to the access router of MN currently connecting. For routing path management, the protocol also specifies the functionality of the access router to provide the MN's IP address, MN identifier to edge mobility anchor point. The protocol does not require the mobile node to involve in the mobility management if link layer technology can provide MN related information necessary for this protocol.</t>
