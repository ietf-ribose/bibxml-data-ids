      <t>This document reports the experience of China Telecom in a recent experiment with the ALTO service and P2P caches deployment. It is found that the deployment of the ALTO service significantly improves the capability of a Service Provider to affect the distribution of P2P traffic. It is also found that a traffic localized ALTO policy may decrease the download speed of a P2P user. However, the deployment of some P2P caches can compensate such influence.</t>
