      <t>The IETF and the RFC series are trusted names, for producing high quality technical documents that make the Internet work better. While the success of our documents is variable, many of them are widely used over a long time period. As norms in the outside world change, our documents need to remain relevant and accessible to future generations of those working on the internet, everywhere in the world. This longevity of our documents, and the impossibility of predicting the future, implies that we should be conservative in the language that we send. Effective language expresses our intent with clarity, and without distraction. This document describes a mechanism for increasing awareness of words that are likely to cause distraction to readers, both now and in the future, while maintaining document clarity and not interfering with our mission.</t>
