      <t>The RSVP model for communicating requests to network devices along adatapath has proven useful for a variety of applications beyond whatthe protocol designers envisioned, and while the architectural modelgeneralizes well the protocol itself has a number of features thatlimit its applicability to applications other than IntServ. NetworkLayer Signaling uses the RSVP on-path communication model andprovides a lightweight transport layer for non-QoS signalingapplications, such as discovery or diagnostics. It is based on a"two-layer" architecture that divides protocol function intotransport and application. This document describes the transportprotocol.</t>
