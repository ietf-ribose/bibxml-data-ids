      <t>The purpose of this document is to collect and put under discussionrequirements for a protocol allowing for decomposition ofapplication-awareness from packet processing in firewalls. Theprotocol will be used by application-aware entities to controlpacket flows of applications traversing firewalls dynamically. Thiskind of control allows applications using session control protocolsto traverse firewalls while still retaining restrictive packetfiltering policy. Network management tools may also utilize theprotocol to manage packet-processing policies. We suggest anextensible framework that may be used for management of arbitraryper-flow control states in network nodes.</t>
