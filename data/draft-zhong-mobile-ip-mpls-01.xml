      <t>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) combines the efficiency and simplicity of IP routing together with the high-speed switching of ATM. Mobile IP is a protocol that allows mobile users to maintain continuous IP network connectivity. In this document, we describe a scheme to integrate both the Mobile IP and MPLS protocols. The integration of both these protocols improves the scalability of the Mobile IP data forwarding process by leveraging on the features of MPLS which are fast switching, small state maintenance and high scalability. In addition, we have removed the need for IP-in-IP tunneling from Home Agent (HA) to Foreign Agent (FA) under this scheme. This document defines the signaling and control mechanisms required to integrate MPLS and Mobile IP.</t>
