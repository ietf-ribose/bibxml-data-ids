      <t>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) combines the efficiency and simplicity of IP routing together with the high-speed switching ofATM. Mobile IP is a protocol that allows mobile users to maintaincontinuous IP network connectivity. In this document, we describea scheme to integrate both the Mobile IP and MPLS protocols. Theintegration of both these protocols improves the scalability of theMobile IP data forwarding process by leveraging on the features ofMPLS which are fast switching, small state maintenance and highscalability. In addition, we have removed the need for IP-in-IP tunneling from Home Agent (HA) to Foreign Agent (FA) under thisscheme. This document defines the signaling and control mechanismsrequired to integrate MPLS and Mobile IP.</t>
