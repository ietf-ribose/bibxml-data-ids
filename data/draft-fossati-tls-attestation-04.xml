    <abstract>
      <t>Attestation is the process by which an entity produces evidence about itself that another party can use to evaluate the trustworthiness of that entity. In use cases that require the use of remote attestation, such as confidential computing or device onboarding, an attester has to convey evidence or attestation results to a relying party. This information exchange may happen at different layers in the protocol stack. This specification provides a generic way of passing evidence and attestation results in the TLS handshake. Functionality-wise this is accomplished with the help of key attestation.</t>
