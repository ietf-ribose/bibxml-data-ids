      <t>DiffServ architecture provides a set of 'user plane' tools for IP QoS.Deployment of DiffServ is starting with static, single-domain solutions.Dynamic QoS and multi-domain QoS are still open issues, as witnessed bythe activity of the IETF NSIS WG, related to the 'signaling plane'.In order to realize true end-to-end QoS services in the Internet,spanning multiple administrative domains, efficient and scalablesignaling and resource control mechanisms are needed.This document describes a scalable inter-domain resource controlarchitecture for DiffServ networks. The architecture is called BGRPPlus, as it extends the previously proposed BGRP framework.</t>
