      <t>DiffServ architecture provides a set of 'user plane' tools for IP QoS. Deployment of DiffServ is starting with static, single-domain solutions. Dynamic QoS and multi-domain QoS are still open issues, as witnessed by the activity of the IETF NSIS WG, related to the 'signaling plane'. In order to realize true end-to-end QoS services in the Internet, spanning multiple administrative domains, efficient and scalable signaling and resource control mechanisms are needed. This document describes a scalable inter-domain resource control architecture for DiffServ networks. The architecture is called BGRP Plus, as it extends the previously proposed BGRP framework.</t>
