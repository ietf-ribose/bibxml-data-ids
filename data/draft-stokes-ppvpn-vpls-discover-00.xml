      <t>This document describes a methodology for allowing the nodes in a Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) network as described in [VPLS] to discover each other via MPLS signaling. It also defines a methodology whereby the individual VPLS services are discovered via MPLS signaling. The goal is to allow a VPLS network to be created using MPLS signaling and a minimal amount of configuration.</t>
