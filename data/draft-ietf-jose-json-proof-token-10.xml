    <abstract>
      <t>JSON Proof Token (JPT) is a compact, URL-safe, privacy-preserving representation of claims to be transferred between three parties. The claims in a JPT are encoded as base64url-encoded JSON objects that are used as the payloads of a JSON Web Proof (JWP) structure, enabling them to be digitally signed and selectively disclosed. JPTs also support reusability and unlinkability when using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). A CBOR-based representation of JPTs is also defined, called a CBOR Proof Token (CPT). It has the same properties as JPTs, but uses the JSON Web Proof (JWP) CBOR Serialization, rather than the JSON-based JWP Compact Serialization.</t>
