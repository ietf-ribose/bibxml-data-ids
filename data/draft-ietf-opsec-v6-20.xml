    <abstract>
      <t>Knowledge and experience on how to operate IPv4 securely is available: whether it is the Internet or an enterprise internal network. However, IPv6 presents some new security challenges. RFC 4942 describes the security issues in the protocol but network managers also need a more practical, operations-minded document to enumerate advantages and/or disadvantages of certain choices. This document analyzes the operational security issues in several places of a network (enterprises, service providers and residential users) and proposes technical and procedural mitigations techniques. Some very specific places of a network such as the Internet of Things are not discussed in this document.</t>
