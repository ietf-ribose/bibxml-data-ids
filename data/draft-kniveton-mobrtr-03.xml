      <t>This document describes how to support mobile networks with Mobile IP or Mobile IPv6 using reverse tunneling. It provides this support capability with no modifications to Mobile IP or routing protocol signaling, but also defines new extensions to ease in the implementation of network mobility. There are two described scenarios of mobile router support, consumer mode, and fully enabled mode. In the former, the mobile router is not allowed to use routing protocol signaling with the home agent, but performs routing for subnet(s) assigned to it. In the latter mode, both the home agent and the mobile router use a routing protocol in the same manner as fixed routers.</t>
