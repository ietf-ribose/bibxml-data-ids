      <t>This document describes how to support mobile networks with MobileIP or Mobile IPv6 using reverse tunneling. It provides this supportcapability with no modifications to Mobile IP or routing protocolsignaling, but also defines new extensions to ease in the implementationof network mobility. There are two described scenarios of mobile routersupport, consumer mode, and fully enabled mode. In the former, themobile router is not allowed to use routing protocol signaling with thehome agent, but performs routing for subnet(s) assigned to it. In thelatter mode, both the home agent and the mobile router use a routingprotocol in the same manner as fixed routers.</t>
