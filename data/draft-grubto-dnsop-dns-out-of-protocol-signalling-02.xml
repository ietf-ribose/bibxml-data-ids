    <abstract>
      <t>This document seeks to specify a method for name servers to signal programs outside of the name server software, and which are not necessarily involved with the DNS protocol, about conditions that can arise within the name server. These signals can be used to invoke actions in areas that help provide the DNS service, such as routing. Currently this document serves as a requirements document to come to a signalling mechanism that will suit the use cases best. Part of that effort is to assemble a list of conditions with potential associated out of DNS protocol actions, as well as inventory and assess existing signalling mechanisms for suitability.</t>
