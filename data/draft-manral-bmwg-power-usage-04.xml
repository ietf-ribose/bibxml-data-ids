      <t>With the rapid growth of networks around the globe there is an ever increasing need to improve the energy efficiency of network devices. Operators are begining to seek more information of power consumption in the network, have no standard mechanism to measure, report and compare power usage of different networking equipment under different network configuration and conditions. This document provides suggestions for measuring power usage of live networks under different traffic loads and various switch router configuration settings. It provides a benchmarking suite which can be employed for any networking device .</t>
