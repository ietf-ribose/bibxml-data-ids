      <t>Service chaining is the concept of applying an ordered set of services to a packet or a flow. Services in the chain may include network services such as load-balancing, firewalling, intrusion prevention, and routing among others. Criteria for applying a service chain to a packet or flow can be based on packet/flow attributes that span the OSI layers (e.g., physical port, Ethernet MAC header information, IP header information, transport, and application layer information). This document describes use cases and I2RS (Information to the Rousting System) requirements for the discovery and maintenance of services topology and resources. It also describes use cases and I2RS requirements for controlling the forwarding of a packet/flow along a service chain based on packet/flow attributes.</t>
