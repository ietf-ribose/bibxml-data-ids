      <t>This memo describes mechanisms and introduces a protocol for the management of cryptographic keys as required for the management of security associations in IPSP and IPv6. Our key management scheme adheres to a modular approach, namely, the scheme is separated into two modules: An upper module in which a long-lived (``master'') key is exchanged between the communicating parties, and a lower module, in which the already shared (master) key is used for the derivation, sharing and/or refreshment of additional short-lived keys to be used for the cryptographic transformations applied to the data. In this draft, we concentrate on the management module for short-lived keys, and indicate how proposed variants of public key-based master key exchange protocols can be accommodated in the upper module.</t>
