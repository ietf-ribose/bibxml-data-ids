      <t>For many reasons, remote participation in IETF meetings has increased. As the Internet grows, so does the participation by engineers worldwide. Remote participation with more than one person is considered a hub. Three types of remote hubs are defined. Some exist today; other types may exist in the future. Each has its own characteristics. - Remote Participation Hubs (future) - Remote Viewing Hubs (today) - Enduring Local Meetups (today) This document defines a Remote Viewing Hub (RVH). Other documents define the other types of hubs. A common structure of sections will be used as far as possible for all hub types.</t>
