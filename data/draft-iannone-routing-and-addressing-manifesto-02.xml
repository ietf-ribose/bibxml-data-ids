      <t>Despite the stability of the Internet technology, tremendous advances and important innovation are always happening. In particular, routing and addressing have profoundly changed during the years, with interesting research still ongoing and engineers willing to be hear about recent advance that may solve their operational problems. However, researchers and engineers lack a dedicated forum where they can meet and interact to discuss about routing and addressing. This document advocates the creation of such forum, to bring together these communities (researchers and engineers) and offer a dedicated venue.</t>
