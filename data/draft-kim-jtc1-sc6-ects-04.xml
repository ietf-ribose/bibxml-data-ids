      <t>This memo is the final Committee Draft of the Enhanced Transport Service Definition under development within ISO/IEC JTC1/SC6/WG7 sincelast several years in order to provide to the upper-layer applicationsenhanced transport services over the current OSI transport service;major enhancements include multicast services and enhanced QoS. This memo is distributed to possibly interested grops within IETF,especially to experts in Transport Area, to make noticed the efforts being made within SC6 to come up with a new transport service definition meeting the wide range of requirements of the both current and future multimedia multicast applications. It is to be noted that a protocol maned ECTP(Enhanced Communications Transport Protocol) supporting this ECTS is also under development within SC6 and will be made public in the near future. Experts interested in this topic might compare the services defined by ECTS with those provided by more known protocols including RTP, MTP, RMP, and RAMP. The ultimate apparent objective of ECTS is the multimedia multicast transport service with varying degrees of reliability and multicast QoS.</t>
