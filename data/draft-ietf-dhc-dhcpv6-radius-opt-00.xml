      <t>The DHCPv6 RADIUS option provides a communication mechanism between relay agent and the server. This mechanism can help the centralized DHCPv6 server to select the right configuration for the client based on the authorization information received from a separate RADIUS server which is not located at the same place of DHCPv6 server in the cases where the NAS acts as DHCPv6 relay agent and RADIUS client simultaneously.</t>
