      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Extension for Event StatePublication describes a mechanism for a User Agent Client (UAC) topublish event state information to a User Agent Server (UAS).Generally, the UAC is free to monitor certain resources at a certainrate and publish changes of their event state, for instance with thepresence event package. However, for a UAC on a mobile device, thiscan be very costly in terms of battery, computing, and networkresources. Although some mechnisms exist for a UAC to deduce whetherevent state publication is needed and at what rate publish messagesmay be sent, these are rather coarse and reactive in nature. Thismemo defines a solution for a UAS to regulate monitoring andpublications by providing detailed information to the UAC regardingwhich resources to monitor, at what rate, whether urgent and withwhat delta.</t>
