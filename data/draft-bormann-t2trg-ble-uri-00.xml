      <t>In addition to its use as a subnetwork layer for IP (e.g., via RFC 7668), in various IoT web applications Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) can serve as a "local interconnect", connecting devices locally (i.e., not over IP) for use as a source of information and a target for actuation. In order to fully use these capabilities in applications using web technologies, there is a need for a method for addressing the resources, i.e., a URI scheme, and definition of the representation of the data exchanged between the application and devices, i.e., media types. This document is a straw man proposal for such a URI scheme and media types for interacting with the Bluetooth GAP and GATT protocols.</t>
