      <t>This document describes the NSIS Signaling Layer protocol (NSLP) for network traffic authorization on the Internet, the Permission-Based Sending (PBS) NSLP. This NSLP aims to prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and other forms of unauthorized traffic. PBS NSLP is based on a hybrid approach: a proactive approach of explicitly granting permissions and a reactive approach of monitoring and countering attacks. Signaling installs and maintains the permission state of routers for a data flow. A monitoring mechanism provides a second line of defense against attacks. PBS NSLP uses two security mechanisms: message security for protecting the integrity of the message on end-to-end traffic and channel security for protecting the integrity and confidentiality between adjacent nodes. To authenticate data packets, the PBS NSLP requests a sender to use an existing security protocol, the IPsec Authentication Header (AH).</t>
