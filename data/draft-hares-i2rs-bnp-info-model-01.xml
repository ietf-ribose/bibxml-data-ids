      <t>This document contains the Basic Network Policy (BNP IM) Information Model which an instantiation and extension of the PCIM work (RFC3060, RFC 3460, RFC 3644) that supports both the configuration models and the I2RS ephemeral models. The PCIM work contains a Policy Core Information Model (PCIM) (RFC3060) and the Quality of Service (QoS) Policy Information Model (QPIM)(RFC3644) and policy based routing. The PCIM work provided a framework to incorporate ACL filters, prefix filters, and more complex filters. This extension to PCIM model incorporate ACLs, Prefix-filtering, and complex policy (match, set, modify, set) into the PCIM framework. Complex policy is need by I2RS programmatic interface to BGP, flow specification filtering, Policy Based Routing (PBR), MPLS topology management, and flow specification filtering.</t>
