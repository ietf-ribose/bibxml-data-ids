      <t>Metering is typically performed at the edge of a Diffserv-aware network where customer traffic is checked for conformance or else where networks interconnect using shaping/policing as a practical matter in IP networks. This document describes the importance of the consistent metering in Diffserv traffic conditioning. This document also proposes the concepts and the associated details to be adapted by Diffserv informal model [DIFFSERV-MODEL] to achieve the desired consistency.</t>
