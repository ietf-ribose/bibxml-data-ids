      <t>HTTP intermediaries sometimes need to terminate long-lived request streams in order to facilitate load balancing or impose data limits. However, Web browsers commonly cannot retry failed proxied requests when they cannot ascertain whether an in-progress request was acted on. To avoid user-visible failures, it is best for the intermediary to inform the client of upcoming request stream terminations in advance of the actual termination so that the client can wrap up existing operations related to that stream and start sending new work to a different stream or connection. This document specifies a new "WRAP_UP" capsule that allows a proxy to instruct a client that it should not start new requests on a tunneled connection, while still allowing it to finish existing requests.</t>
