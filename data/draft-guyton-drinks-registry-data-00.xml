      <t>This document defines data that should be included in a provisioning interface for a Registry. The provisioning interface may be used in(near) real time, or periodically, from a service provider's serviceprovisioning system to establish and administer telephone number (TN)and associated routing information in the Registry after necessaryvalidations. Based on 1) effective date/time specified for the dataand 2) validation of the TN assignee, these data will be used todefine selective routing views for various recipient service providerswhich would be reflected in ENUM-SIP address servers. In addition,the concept of multiple TNs sharing a common routing pattern simplifiesthe definition and administration of routing data.D.
