      <t>This document presents a security framework for routing over lowpower and lossy networks. The development builds upon previous workon routing security and adapts the assessments to the issues andconstraints specific to low power and lossy networks. A systematicapproach is used in defining and evaluating the security threats andidentifying applicable countermeasures. These assessments providethe basis of the security recommendations for incorporation into lowpower, lossy network routing protocols. As an illustration, thisframework is applied to RPL.</t>
