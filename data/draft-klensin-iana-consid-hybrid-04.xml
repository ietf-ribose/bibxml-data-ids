      <t>The current Guidelines for Writing an IANA Considerations Section in RFCs specifies ten well-known registration policies. Since it was published in 2017, the IETF's focus for many registries has evolved away from the notion of strong IETF review and consensus toward trying to be sure names are registered to prevent conflicts. Several of the policies that were heavily used in the past appear to present too high a barrier to getting names into registries to prevent accidental reuse of the same strings. This specifies an eleventh well-known policy that avoids the implied tension, essentially combining two of the existing policies.</t>
