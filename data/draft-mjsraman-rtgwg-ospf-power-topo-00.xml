    <abstract>
      <t>In a Interior Gateway Protocol like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) the computation of the shortest path tree to all destinations is computed for an area say a backbone or a non-backbone area. With importance given to the reduction of power within a network it becomes important to provide a solution that reduces the power consumed amongst routers and links that make up the network (in this case an area or a collection of areas including the backbone and non- backbone areas). This proposal aims at providing such a solution by producing a power topology of the area / areas. This power topology is constructed by assigning metrics to links based on the power consumed by the linecards (and hence their respective ports in an indirect way) of adjacent routers that are interconnected by each such link.</t>
