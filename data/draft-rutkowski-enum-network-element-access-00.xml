      <t>ENUM is an Internet information service for the benefitof private users of the Internet. It makes use ofauthoritative E.164 telephone number data maintainedamong public telecommunication service providers toenable some useful value added messaging services onthe Internet. Anyone can (and several companies do)provide these ENUM services competitively today withoutgovernment involvement or regulation. Other providerscan enter the marketplace.Although one ENUM provisioning option is to denominatea particular Internet offering worldwide as 'public'and 'authoritative,' there are significant technical,operational, and regulatory burdens and costs createdthat make the prospect rather daunting at best. It isalso unnecessary. A more effective alternative is tofacilitate ENUM service providers' access to authoritative E.164 number and customer information through fair and non-discriminatory contractual arrangements with public telecommunication service providers, and leave the rest to a competitive ENUM provider marketplace and the commercial relationships between Internet Service Providers and public telecommunication carriers.</t>
