      <t>ENUM is an Internet information service for the benefit of private users of the Internet. It makes use of authoritative E.164 telephone number data maintained among public telecommunication service providers to enable some useful value added messaging services on the Internet. Anyone can (and several companies do) provide these ENUM services competitively today without government involvement or regulation. Other providers can enter the marketplace. Although one ENUM provisioning option is to denominate a particular Internet offering worldwide as 'public' and 'authoritative,' there are significant technical, operational, and regulatory burdens and costs created that make the prospect rather daunting at best. It is also unnecessary. A more effective alternative is to facilitate ENUM service providers' access to authoritative E.164 number and customer information through fair and non-discriminatory contractual arrangements with public telecommunication service providers, and leave the rest to a competitive ENUM provider marketplace and the commercial relationships between Internet Service Providers and public telecommunication carriers.</t>
