    <abstract>
      <t>IP based networks use a number of routing protocols, including RIP, OSPF, IS-IS, and BGP, to determine how packets ought to be routed. Among these protocols, OSPF and BGP are IETF-recommended standards that have been extensively deployed and exercised in many networks. In this memo, we describe a mechanism which uses these protocols as the basis for switching IP datagrams, by the addition of a simple protocol ('ARIS') that establishes switched paths through a network. The ARIS protocol allows us to leverage the advantages of switching technologies in an internet network. This memo is defined with respect to ATM. ARIS can be easily extended to other switching technologies.</t>
