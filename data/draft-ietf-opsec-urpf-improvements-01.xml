    <abstract>
      <t>This document identifies a need for improvement of the unicast Reverse Path Filtering techniques (uRPF) [BCP84] for source address validation (SAV) [BCP38]. The strict uRPF is inflexible about directionality, the loose uRPF is oblivious to directionality, and the current feasible-path uRPF attempts to strike a balance between the two [BCP84]. However, as shown in this draft, the existing feasible-path uRPF still has short comings. This document describes an enhanced feasible-path uRPF technique, which aims to be more flexible (in a meaningful way) about directionality than the feasible-path uRPF. It can potentially alleviate ISPs' concerns about the possibility of disrupting service for their customers, and encourage greater deployment of uRPF techniques.</t>
