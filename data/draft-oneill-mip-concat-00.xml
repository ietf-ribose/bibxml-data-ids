      <t>Nested MIP [NestMIP] provides a means to support both localization and aggregation of MIP signalling. It achieves this by providing two distinct layers of MIP signalling and forwarding; a local access layer that provides local mobility management and local access services, and a remote access layer that provides remote access back to a home subnet. The local access layer provides a regional address from a Regional Mobility Agent (a regional HA) that is then used as a CCoA for the remote access layer. Inter-FA movement and MIP signalling at the local access layer then automatically produces the hand-off of potentially multiple parallel remote access sessions. The consequences of this model are however reductions in bandwidth efficiency due to the additional layers of temporary and permanent encapsulation. This draft describes a complementary model for MIP forwarding, called Concatenated MIP that re-uses, and extends the localised and aggregated MIP signalling model from [NestMIP]. The enhanced forwarding model is intended to co-exist both with [NestMIP] and [RegTunMods] so that the appropriate trade-offs can be made on a per session basis between bandwidth efficiency and other features. Inter-RMA hand-offs between Nesting and Concatenating Regional Mobility Agents is also supported.</t>
