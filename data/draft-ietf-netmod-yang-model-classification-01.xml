      <t>The YANG [RFC6020] data modeling language is currently being considered for a wide variety of applications throughout the networking industry at large. Many standards-defining organizations (SDOs), open source software projects, vendors and users are using YANG to develop and publish models of configuration, state data and operations for a wide variety of applications. At the same time, there is currently no well-known terminology to categorize various types of YANG models. A consistent terminology would help with the categorization of models, assist in the analysis the YANG data modeling efforts in the IETF and other organizations, and bring clarity to the YANG-related discussions between the different groups. This document describes a set of concepts and associated terms to support consistent classification of YANG models.</t>
