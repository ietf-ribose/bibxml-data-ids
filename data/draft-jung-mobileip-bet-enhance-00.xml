    <abstract>
      <t>To support real-time services such as VoIP in Mobile IPv4/v6, several fast handover methods have been proposed. The fast handover method using BET is one of them and was chosen as an alternate protocol to FMIPv6 version 4. BET has advantage in reducing the handover latency because it does not perform the layer 3 registration. However, the long BET in certain situation could be not acceptable. In that case, a mechanism is needed to limit the tunnel length of BET. In this draft, we propose to group the ARs by predefined value to limit the tunnel length of BET. An anchor router is changed whenever a MN changes its associated group.</t>
