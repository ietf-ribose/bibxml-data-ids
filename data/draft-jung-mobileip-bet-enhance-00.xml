      <t>To support real-time services such as VoIP in Mobile IPv4/v6, severalfast handover methods have been proposed. The fast handover methodusing BET is one of them and was chosen as an alternate protocol toFMIPv6 version 4. BET has advantage in reducing the handover latencybecause it does not perform the layer 3 registration. However, thelong BET in certain situation could be not acceptable. In that case,a mechanism is needed to limit the tunnel length of BET. In thisdraft, we propose to group the ARs by predefined value to limit thetunnel length of BET. An anchor router is changed whenever a MNchanges its associated group.</t>
