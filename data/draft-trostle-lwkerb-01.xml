      <t>The Kerberos V5 protocol [3] allows network entities to authenticateand establish shared secret keys. Some network applications wouldbenefit from a lightweight authentication mechanism with many of thebenefits of Kerberos, but where the messages have fewer bytes thanexisting Kerberos messages. Also, we describe a protocol option thatrequires only two messages to be sent and received from the client,to support lightweight clients. This document describes a Kerberos-like protocol that does not use ASN.1 and is optimized for smallermessages. The protocol makes use of existing Kerberos infrastructure.</t>
