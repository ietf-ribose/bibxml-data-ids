      <t>The Kerberos V5 protocol [3] allows network entities to authenticate and establish shared secret keys. Some network applications would benefit from a lightweight authentication mechanism with many of the benefits of Kerberos, but where the messages have fewer bytes than existing Kerberos messages. Also, we describe a protocol option that requires only two messages to be sent and received from the client, to support lightweight clients. This document describes a Kerberos- like protocol that does not use ASN.1 and is optimized for smaller messages. The protocol makes use of existing Kerberos infrastructure.</t>
