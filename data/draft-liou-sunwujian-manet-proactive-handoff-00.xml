      <t>Driven by government policy and advanced radio technologies , opportunistic spectrum usage plays an ever-increasing role in the next generation communication system. Due to the random characteristics of primary users, it is impossible to fully describe the activity feature in terms of time and space, rendering opportunity usage unsafe. In order to minimize interference to primary users, a history knowledge based algorithm is proposed in this work, which compound historical statistics with current information. Random early detection (RED) algorithm, which proves to be efficient in active queue management (AQM) for switching fabrics, is introduced to help select the desirable channel. In order to further suppress the collision probability, all the channels are sorted according to availability. Simulation results show that, compared with completely random spectrum selection method, the proposed RED-based channel access method gives better performance in terms of channel selection delay.</t>
