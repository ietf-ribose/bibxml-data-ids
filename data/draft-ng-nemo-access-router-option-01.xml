      <t>Through the establishment of bi-directional tunnels between a mobile router and home agent, global connectivity can be extended to nodes within a network in motion. However, the multiple levels of bi- directional tunnels in nested mobile networks lead to undesirable effects. This memo proposes using a new mobility header option called the Access Router Option to allow a mobile router to inform its home agent the home-address of the access router it is currently attached to. From there, this memo lays out a mechanism that allows mobile routers to securely achieve nested tunnels optimization.</t>
