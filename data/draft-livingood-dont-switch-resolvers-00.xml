      <t>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is beginning widespread deployment. However, domain signing tools and processes are not yet as mature and reliable as is the case for non-DNSSEC-related domain administration tools and processes. As a result, some DNSSEC validation failures may occur. When these failures do occur, end users SHOULD NOT change to a non-validating DNS resolver.</t>
