      <t>This document describes the routing loop and packet looping issues inmobile ad hoc network (MANET) running proactive routing protocolsusing hop count metric.Mechanisms of loop formation are identified and how the problem ofloop formation is exacerbated by the use of Link Layer Notificationis described. The effect of the looping packets on the network areshown by comparing against the case where the looping packets aredetected and discarded, showing the need for routing loops or loopingpackets to be dealt with in MANETs.</t>
