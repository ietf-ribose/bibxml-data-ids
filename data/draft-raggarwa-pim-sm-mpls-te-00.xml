      <t>This document describes procedures for IP multicast over a MPLS Traffic Engineered (TE) core. The defined procedures apply when the Provider Edge (PE) routers are running PIM-SM to exchange multicast routing information with the Customer Edge (CE) routers. Point to multipoint (P2MP) MPLS TE LSPs are used in the network core. The procedures described make use of the PIM-SM remote neighbor extensions described in [PIM-SM-REMOTE].</t>
