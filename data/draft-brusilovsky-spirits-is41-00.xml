      <t>This document describes IS-41 mobility-related parameters (WINinformation and its encoding) which the SPIRITS protocol cantransport from the PSTN (wireline, as well as wireless) into the IPnetwork. The SPIRITS protocol is a protocol through which PSTN canrequest actions (services) to be carried out in the IP network inresponse to events occurring within the PSTN/IN (wireline, as well as wireless). This draft outlines, what IS-41 mobility-ralatedparameters are of immediate interest to SPIRITS, how they may beextracted and encoded for use within the SPIRITS domain. IS-41 isused as an example protocol to clarify the SPIRITS message encodingprocess. This Internet-Draft has been written in response to theSPIRITS WG chairs' call for SPIRITS Protocol proposals. It may beviewed as being a direct contribution to the Informational RFC on the SPIRITS protocol parameters. Section 1 of this document givesbackground of wireless cellular communication networks, includingCore Networks, Section 2 gives a backgrouder for the WirelessIntelligent Network (WIN). Sections 3 and 4 briefly explain WINFunctional and Physical entities. Section 5 provides WIN BCSMDescription. Section 6 gives ASN.1 Notation for the selected WINParameters. Sections 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 respectively provideAcknowledgements, References, Author's Address, Acronyms and FullCopyright Statement, as required. Addendum 1 contains figures.</t>
