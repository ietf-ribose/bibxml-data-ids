      <t>This document describes the management of the mobility events considered in SPIRITS protocol and the definition of their related parameters. The mobility events management will allow a SPIRITS server to subscribe to and to be notified of location changes of a mobile user. The events would only be applicable to mobile users reachable through a CS network. The sending of these events must be allowed by setting the related marks in the HLR. Besides, the SPIRITS protocol must be able to translate the CAMEL operations involving mobility information into events that can be transferred to the SPIRITS client.</t>
