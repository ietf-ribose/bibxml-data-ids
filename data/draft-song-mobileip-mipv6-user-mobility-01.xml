    <abstract>
      <t>The Mobile IP can provide IP mobility. The mobile node identified by its Home Address can have transparent home IP routing service regardless of attaching point. However the need for the user mobility support has identified by wireless operators so as to provide IP routing service, based on the user identifier not based on home IP address. This document specifies the user mobility support for Mobile IPv6 through DNS, while providing semi-secure binding update mechanism for the route optimization between MN and CN.</t>
