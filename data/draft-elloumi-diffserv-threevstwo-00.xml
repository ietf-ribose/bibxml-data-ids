      <t>This informational memo points out advantages of using three drop precedences (compared to two) in the Assured Forwarding (AF) Per- Hop-Behavior (PHB) when the traffic is composed of responsive TCP and non responsive UDP traffic. Our simulation results show that while two drop precedences can, in some cases, guarantee to an aggregate consisting of TCP traffic the full utilization of the reserved bandwidth, they cannot allow to access the unreserved bandwidth in the presence of high bit rate unresponsive UDP traffic. When three drop precedences are appropriately used TCP aggregates can fully use the minimum reserved bandwidth and share the unreserved one.</t>
