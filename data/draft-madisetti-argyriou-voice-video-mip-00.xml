    <abstract>
      <t>Transmission of voice, video and other real-time multimedia data over IP networks is gaining much importance, and Quality of Service (QoS) issues are further compromised when wireless and mobility issues are also included into the picture. A unified approach, VoMo, to addressing QoS through consideration of appropriate signaling, control and data transmission is presented, that has the additional benefits of compliance with current IP network infrastructure through recently proposed IETF protocols, such as Stream Control Tranmission Protocol (SCTP)[RFC2960] and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)[RFC2543].</t>
