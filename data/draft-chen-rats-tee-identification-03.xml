    <abstract>
      <t>In security considerations, identities of devices like certifications, private keys should be protected and cannot be exposed in public in plaintext during whole lifecycle. When using these identities to make authentications a unified architecture to prevent identity information leakage is needed. This document creates a secure and trusted TEE authentication architecture to authenticate a device's identity based on EAP-TLS and TEE. In this architecture, certificate and handshake keys which are used for EAP- TLS will be executed in TEE. Communication establishment with EAP- TLS Server will be executed in REE. A middle layer is introduced to communicate between TEE and REE to compose the original function of EAP-TLS Client. TEE authentication could be used in LAN or WLAN scenarios.</t>
