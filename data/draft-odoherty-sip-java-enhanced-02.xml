      <t>This document defines an extension to the SIP [2] protocol to do a number of things - to extend SIP messages to carry Java applets or Java Mobile Agents, to define a Java SIP API which will allow the Java applet or Java Mobile Agent to interact with the receiving host system and to extend the SIP protocol client so that the Java applet or Java Mobile Agent is run before any other actions are taken on the receipt of a message by the receiving host SIP client.</t>
