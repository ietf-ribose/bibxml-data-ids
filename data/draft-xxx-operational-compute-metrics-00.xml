    <abstract>
      <t>Service providers are starting to deploy computing capabilities across the network for hosting applications such as AR/VR, vehicle networks, IoT, and AI training, among others. In these distributed computing environments, information about computing and communication resources is necessary to determine both the proper deployment location of each application and the best server location on which to run it. This information is used by numerous different implementations with different interpretations. This document proposes an initial approach towards a common understanding and exposure scheme for metrics reflecting compute capabilities.</t>
