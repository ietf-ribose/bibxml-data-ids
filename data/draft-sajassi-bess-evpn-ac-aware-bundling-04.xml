    <abstract>
      <t>EVPN provides an extensible and flexible multi-homing VPN solution over an MPLS/IP network for intra-subnet connectivity among Tenant Systems and End Devices that can be physical or virtual. EVPN multihoming with IRB is one of the common deployment scenarios. There are deployments which requires capability to have multiple subnets designated with multiple VLAN IDs in single Broadcast Domain. EVPN technology defines three different types of service interface which serve different requirements but none of them address the requirement of supporting multiple subnets within single Broadcast Domain. In this draft we define new service interface type to support multiple subnets in single Broadcast Domain. Service interface proposed in this draft will be applicable to multihoming case only.</t>
