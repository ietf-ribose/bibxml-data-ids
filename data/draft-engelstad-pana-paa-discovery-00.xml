      <t>A PANA authentication protocol is under development in the PANAWorking Group. It will allow hosts to authenticate with PANAAuthentication Agents (PAAs). The protocol is expected to run oversome IP-based transport protocol, such as ICMP, UDP, TCP or SCTP.Before a host can authenticate with a PAA, it must obtain an IP-address of the PAA. This document specifies such a 'discovery'mechanism by defining extensions (or options) to RouterAdvertisements and DHCP messages for both IPv4 and IPv6. Hosts MAYalso obtain an identity of a PAA and other information during thediscovery process. The proposed discovery mechanism makes noassumptions about the location of a PAA, and more than one PAA maybe discovered.</t>
