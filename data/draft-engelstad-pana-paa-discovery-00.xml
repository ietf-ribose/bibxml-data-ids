      <t>A PANA authentication protocol is under development in the PANA Working Group. It will allow hosts to authenticate with PANA Authentication Agents (PAAs). The protocol is expected to run over some IP-based transport protocol, such as ICMP, UDP, TCP or SCTP. Before a host can authenticate with a PAA, it must obtain an IP- address of the PAA. This document specifies such a 'discovery' mechanism by defining extensions (or options) to Router Advertisements and DHCP messages for both IPv4 and IPv6. Hosts MAY also obtain an identity of a PAA and other information during the discovery process. The proposed discovery mechanism makes no assumptions about the location of a PAA, and more than one PAA may be discovered.</t>
