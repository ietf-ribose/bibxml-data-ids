      <t>As part of the SPARTACUS DNS gateway system, building a full DNS parser was necessary. Parsing DNS packets is the only way to avoid propogating packets which are not correctly formatted DNS packets. In order to facilitate building a new parser from scratch, the author chose to build a parser-builder which takes as input, a description of the DNS wire format. This document describes the language created to facilitate this description, and includes the resulting DNS wire format description in this language.</t>
