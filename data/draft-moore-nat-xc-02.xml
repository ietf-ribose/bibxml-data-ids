      <t>This document describes a mechanism called NAT-XC (for NAT withExplicit Control) for translating between IPv4 and IPv6. NAT-XC isdistinguished from other IPv4/IPv6 translations schemes in that itseparates the translation between IPv4 and IPv6 from the managementof address bindings for such a translation; and is designed to allowapplications to be explicitly aware of, and control, their addressbindings. NAT-XC can be used by both IPv4 clients wishing tocommunicate via IPv6, and IPv6 clients wishing to communicate viaIPv4. NAT-XC appears to be usable in a wide variety of scenariosrequiring communication across IPv4/IPv6 boundaries.</t>
