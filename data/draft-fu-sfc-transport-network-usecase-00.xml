      <t>This document proposes a usecase of Service Function Chaining(SFC) to realize Virtual Customer Premises Equipment (VCPE) in the transport network. In this document, the concept of VCPE is introduced into the transport network to provide value-added services for the enterprise customers. The SFC is used to realize the VCPE and chains different services according to the requirement of the customers. Such architecture can provide value-added and self-defined services to the customers. In the meantime, SDN controller is utilized in the usecase to direct certain traffic flows to the VCPE. This usecase provides a practical mechanism to offer value-added and self-defined services in the transport network without complicating the CPE devices or increase OPEX and CAPEX cost.</t>
