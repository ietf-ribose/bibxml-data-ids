      <t>Aggregate Server Access Protocol (ASAP) in conjunction with ENRP [ENRP] provides a fault tolerant data transfer mechanism over IP networks. ASAP uses a name-based addressing model which isolates a logical communication endpoint from its IP address(es), thus effectively eliminating the binding between the communication endpoint and its physical IP address(es) which normally constitutes a single point of failure.</t>
