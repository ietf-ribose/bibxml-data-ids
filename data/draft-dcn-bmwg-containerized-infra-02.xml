      <t>This draft describes benchmarking considerations for the containerized infrastructure. In the containerized infrastructure, Virtualized Network Functions(VNFs) are deployed on operating-system- level virtualization platform by abstracting the user namespace as opposed to virtualization using a hypervisor. Leveraging this, the system configurations and networking scenarios for benchmarking will be partially changed by the way in which the resource allocation and network technologies specified for containerized VNFs. In this draft we compare the state of the art in a container networking architecture with networking on VM-based virtualized systems, and provide several test scenarios in the containerized infrastructure.</t>
