    <abstract>
      <t>BGP speakers learn their next hop addresses for NLRI in RFC-4271 in the NEXT_HOP field and in RFC-4760 in the "Network Address of Next Hop" field. Under certain circumstances, it might be desirable for a BGP speaker to know both the next hops and the next-next hops of NLRI to make optimal forwarding decisions. One such example is global load balancing (GLB) in a Clos network. Draft-ietf-idr-entropy-label defines the "Next Hop Dependent Capabilities Attribute" (NHC) which allows a BGP speaker to signal the forwarding capabilities associated with a given next hop. This document defines a new NHC capability, the Next-next Hop Nodes (NNHN) capability, which can be used to advertise the next-next hop nodes associated with a given next hop.</t>
