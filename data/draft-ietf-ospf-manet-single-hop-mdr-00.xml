      <t>RFC 5614 (OSPF-MDR) extends OSPF to support mobile ad hoc networks(MANETs) by specifying its operation on the new OSPF interface of typeMANET. This document describes the use of OSPF-MDR in a single-hopbroadcast network, which is a special case of a MANET in which eachrouter is a (one-hop) neighbor of each other router. Unlike an OSPFbroadcast interface, such an interface can have a different costassociated with each neighbor. The document includes configurationrecommendations and simplified mechanisms that can be used in single-hopbroadcast networks.</t>
