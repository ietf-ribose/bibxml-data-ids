    <abstract>
      <t>The document proposes a solution called Resilient Cycle Queuing and Forwarding (RCQF) for DetNet extremely low data loss rates, bounded latency and minimal jitter. RCQF is a technological advancement built upon Cycle Queuing and Forwarding (CQF), designed to provide a capability for the delivery of end-to-end DetNet flows. RCQF extends the capabilities of CQF and makes it suitable for large scaling networks. The elasticity of RCQF includes adaptive bonded latency, minimal jitter, high bandwidth, large packet size, interface speed, and only requires frequency synchronization. This document aims to introduce the concept of RCQF and its potential in providing resilient and adaptable solutions for Deterministic Networks.</t>
