      <t>The Host Identity Protocol [RFC5201] is a secure signaling protocol with a cryptographic namespace. It provides the communicating peers with a cryptographic puzzle mechanism to protect against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks targeting its computation and memory overhead. This document specifies an extension that enables middleboxes to assist in the choice of the puzzle difficulty as well as in solving the puzzle on behalf of the host.</t>
