      <t>Original uses of an underscore character as a domain node name prefix, which creates a space for constrained interpretation of resource records, were specified without the benefit of an IANA registry. This produced an entirely uncoordinated set of name- creation activities, all drawing from the same namespace. A registry now has been defined. However the existing specifications that use underscore naming need to be modified, to be in line with the new registry. This document specifies those changes. The changes preserve existing software and operational practice, while adapting the specifications for those practices to the newer underscore registry model.</t>
