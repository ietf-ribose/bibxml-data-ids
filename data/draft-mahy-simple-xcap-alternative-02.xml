    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an alternative to XCAP (XML Configuration Access Protocol) for manipulating SIMPLE resource and authorization lists using WebDAV. XCAP and WebDAV are similar in that they are both usages of HTTP. Since servers could support both simultaneously, WebDAV support is a logical progression from XCAP for clients that require locking, version control, document moves or other features of WebDAV.</t>
