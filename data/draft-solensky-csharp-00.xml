      <t>This memo presents an extension to the method of classifying and assigning IP network numbers. It is intended to provide a work-around to the imminent exhaustion of assignable Class B network numbers (and, to a lesser extent, the recent growth of routes that need to be tracked in the NSFNet routing database) by defining the format of Class C-sharp (C#) IP addresses, consuming the upper half of the existing Class C numbering space. The manner in which these changes impact existing systems is also discussed. It is a product of a 'birds-of-a-feather' (BoF) discussion held on July 31, 1991 at the twenty-first IETF conference in Atlanta, GA and subsequent discussions on the mailing list. It should be noted that this document does NOT solve the limitations inherent in the current routing architectures and technology that are discussed. These must wait until new architectures are developed. Specifically, the issue of scaling the size of future routing tables is only indirectly addressed.</t>
