    <abstract>
      <t>Over the years, it has been repeatedly observed that the STD nnnn and BCP nnnn designation for IETF Standards has not worked well, either as a stable reference for external specifications or as a combined reference for multiple documents that are linked together into a single specification. This document proposes two changes that have been discussed on and off for some time, but never written up or considered as specific proposals. The first of these would assign a STD (or BCP) number to a specification when it enters the first level of the Standards Track (or is first designated as a BCP). The second would turn STDs and BCPs into actual documents that describe what they identify and their publication and change history.</t>
