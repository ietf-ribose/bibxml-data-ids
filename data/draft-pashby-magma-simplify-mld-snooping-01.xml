      <t>The purpose of this draft is to simplify the design of MLD Snoopingswitches and provide a method for Solicited Node multicast addressesto be sent to every port to improve network robustment andmanagement.IPv6 Addressing Architecture requires that all nodes must join theassociated Solicited-Node multicast addresses for every unicast andanycast address it is assigned. This causes MLD snooping switches tocreate potentially huge multicast forwarding tables just to handleNeighbor Discovery. A simple change to alleviate this would be toallow switches to forward a range of addresses that include theSolicited-Node multicast addresses to every port. This also couldhelp in network discovery. Similarly the same allowance could bemade for Local Network Control Block (LNCB) addresses.</t>
