      <t>The Differentiated Mail Transfer Protocol (DMTP) provides simpleextensions to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) that enablereceivers to exercise greater control over the email deliveryprocess. The current SMTP-based email delivery architecture isfundamentally sender-driven and distinctly lacks receiver controlover the message delivery mechanisms. This document describes DMTPthat enables receivers to classify senders into three categories --allowed, denied, and unclassified -- and process the delivery ofmessages from each category independently. As is the currentpractice, receivers may directly accept messages from senders in theallowed category and decline senders in the denied category. Inaddition, DMTP receivers require senders in the unclassified categoryto store messages on the senders' own mail servers. Such messagesare retrieved only if and when the end receivers wish to do so. Bygranting greater control over message delivery to receivers andimposing greater message storage and maintenance overhead on senders,DMTP provides significant advantages in controlling spam. DMTPalso easily operates in conjunction with (but does not require) manycurrently deployed anti-spam techniques.</t>
