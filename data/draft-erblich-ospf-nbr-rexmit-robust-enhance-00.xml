      <t>The ability to process LSAs within a Update packet requires that the length field be correct to generate the next offset within the packet. During the rare times that a checksum error and length LSA fields are incorrect, the beginning of later LSAs header's can't be determined. This draft specifies a transparent method to allow all valid LSAs to be processed even when these corrupted LSAs exist on the neighbor's retransmission list.</t>
