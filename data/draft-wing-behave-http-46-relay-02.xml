      <t>As IPv6-only hosts become commonplace, it is desirable to still haveIPv4 clients access those IPv6-only hosts. Due to the size of theIPv4 and IPv6 address spaces, this has proven difficult using pure IPaddress translation. Rather than trying to support all IP protocols,or even all TCP or UDP applications, this document proposes amechanism for an IPv4 HTTP client to connect to an IPv6-only HTTPserver.</t>
