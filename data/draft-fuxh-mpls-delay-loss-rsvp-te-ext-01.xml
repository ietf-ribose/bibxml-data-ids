      <t>With more and more enterprises using cloud based services, the distances between the user and the applications are growing. For multiple applications such as High Performance Computing and Electronic Financial markets, the response times are critical as is packet loss, while other applications require more throughput. For example, financial or trading companies are very focused on end-to- end private pipe line latency optimizations that improve things 2-3 ms. Latency and latency SLA is one of the key parameters that these "high value" customers use to select a private pipe line provider. This document extends RSVP-TE protocol to promote SLA experince of latency and packet loss application.</t>
