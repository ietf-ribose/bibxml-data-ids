      <t>Several applications of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) require a user agent (UA) to construct and distribute a URI which can be used by anyone on the Internet to route a call to that specific UA instance. An example of such an application is call transfer, based on the REFER method. To date, a variety of techniques have been proposed for the contruction of such URI. All of them have fatal drawbacks. This document proposes that the problem is actually one of URI leasing - a feature whereby a UA can dynamically request the creation of an address-of-record (AOR) within a domain. Requirements for a URI leasing mechanism are outlined.</t>
