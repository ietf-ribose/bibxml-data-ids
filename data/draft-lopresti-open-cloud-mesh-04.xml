    <abstract>
      <t>Open Cloud Mesh is a server federation protocol that is used to notify a Receiving Party that they have been granted access to some Resource. It has similarities with authorization flows such as OAuth, as well as with social internet protocols such as ActivityPub and email. Open Cloud Mesh only handles the necessary interactions up to the point where the Receiving Party is informed that they were granted access to the Resource. The actual resource access is then left to protocols such as WebDAV and others.</t>
