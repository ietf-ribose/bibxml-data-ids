      <t>This document specifies the problem statement for the Interface to In-Network Computing Functions (I2ICF) for user services both on the network-level and application-level. In-Network Computing Functions (ICF) include In-Network Network Functions (INF) which are defined in the context of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software- Defined Networking (SDN). ICFs also include In-Network Application Functions (IAF) which appear in the context of Internet-of-Things (IoT) Devices, Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Intent-Based Networking (IBN) can be used to compose user services and consist of a combination of ICFs in a target network. This document investigates the need for a standard framework with the interfaces for ICFs, in terms of applications with the need to run Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the network and interoperability among multi-vendor ICFs.</t>
