      <t>BFD mechanism [BFD] was original designed to detect failures in communication with a forwarding plane next hop. BFD operates on top of any data protocol being forwarded between two systems. This document describes how to use the BFD mechanism for detecting the MPLS FEC mismatch. The proposal is based on the FEC mismatch mechanism of ITU-T Y.1713. The proposed solution covers the mpls network when use BFD as the fault detection mechanism.</t>
