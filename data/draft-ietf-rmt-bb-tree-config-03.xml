      <t>The Reliable Multicast Transport Working Group has been chartered to standardize multicast transport services. This working group expects to initially standardize three protocol instantiations. This draft is concerned with the requirements of the tree-based ACK protocol. In particular, it is concerned with defining the building block for auto-configuration of the logical ACK-tree. According to the charter, a building block is 'a coarse-grained modular component that is common to multiple protocols along with abstract APIs that define a building block's access methods and their arguments.' For more information, see the Reliable Multicast Transport Building Blocks and Reliable Multicast Design Space documents [WLKHFL01][HWKFV00].</t>
