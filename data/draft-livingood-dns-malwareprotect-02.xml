      <t>The objective of this document is to describe the design of so-calledDNS-based malware protection services deployed by Internet ServiceProviders (ISPs), DNS Application Service Providers (ASPs), and otherorganizations. These organizations provide so-called DNS-basedmalware protection services via their recursive DNS servers. Thisdocument specifically and narrowly addresses those cases where theseDNS servers are being utilized to provide a service for end userswhich blocks domains hosting malicious software, and makesrecommendations concerning operation of such a service.</t>
