      <t>In recent era of Information Technology the data traffic over theInternet is increasing uncontrollably. This proliferation of datatraffic is due to general shift towards e-business and other application of Information Technology. The businesses relying onInternet lose billions of dollars each year due to slow or failed web services. Therefore, in Internet research, the mostconspicuous issue is to develop methodologies to reduce nettraffic over the Internet. In this paper, an algorithm is proposedto reduce net data traffic, which works at Internet layer in TCP/IPreference model. The algorithm monitors data repetitions in IPdatagram and prepares a compression code in response of thisrepetition. If no IP datagrams are repeated, no compression codeis sent. Therefore, the algorithm does not put any overhead onthe system. Furthermore, as the proposed algorithm works at IPdatagrams only, therefore, it remains transparent from allclient-server applications.</t>
