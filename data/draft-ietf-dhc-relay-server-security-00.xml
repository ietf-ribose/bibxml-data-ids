      <t>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has no guidance for how to secure messages exchanged between servers and relay agents. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) states that IPsec should be used to secure messages exchanged between servers and relay agents, but does not recommend encryption. And, with recent concerns about pervasive monitoring it is appropriate to provide recommendations for DHCPv4 and also improve the recommendations for DHCPv6. This document updates RFC1542 and RFC3315.</t>
