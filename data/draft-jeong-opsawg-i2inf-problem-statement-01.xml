    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the problem statement for the Interface to In-Network Functions (I2INF) for user services both on the network- level and application-level. In-Network Functions (INF) include In- Network Computing Functions (INCF) which are defined in the context of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). INF also includes In-Network Application Functions (INAF) which appear in the context of Internet-of-Things (IoT) Devices, Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Intent-Based Networking (IBN) can be used to compose user services and consist of a combination of INFs in a target network. This document investigates the gap for an IBN-based system to perform the user's service and the requirements for the I2INF for intelligent service provisioning.</t>
