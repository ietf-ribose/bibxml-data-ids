    <abstract>
      <t>Transparent forwarding caching effectively localizes the downloading P2P traffic within the sub-net under its coverage resulting in reduction of network cost for cross-boundary peer selection, whereas transparent reverse caching blocks the uploading traffic outside a wireless sub-net leading to elimination of network cost for wireless uploading peer selection. In other words, caching between pairs of endpoints changes the traffic cost along the way. Therefore, it is proposed to use locations of caches as dividers of different DIPs to guide intra-ISP network abstraction and mark costs among them according to the location and type of relevant caches.</t>
