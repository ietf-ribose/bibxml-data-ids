      <t>This memo describes alternative, optimized packet structures for theHost Identity Payload and Host Layer Protocol (HIP). The packetstructures presented in this memo are intended replace originalpackets in HIP. In addition, this memo describes a new packet, CER,to transmit certificates.The main objective in redefining HIP packet structures is to make thepacket structures simpler and more distinct, which makes theimplementation work easier, hopefully leading to more secure protocolimplementation. The new structures reduce the average packet size andtake advantage of other existing IPv6 protocols formats, includingalignments concerns, like the newly suggested Mobility header formatfor Mobile IPv6.</t>
