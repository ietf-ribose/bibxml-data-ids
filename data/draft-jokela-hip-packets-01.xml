      <t>This memo describes alternative, optimized packet structures for the Host Identity Payload and Host Layer Protocol (HIP). The packet structures presented in this memo are intended replace original packets in HIP. In addition, this memo describes a new packet, CER, to transmit certificates. The main objective in redefining HIP packet structures is to make the packet structures simpler and more distinct, which makes the implementation work easier, hopefully leading to more secure protocol implementation. The new structures reduce the average packet size and take advantage of other existing IPv6 protocols formats, including alignments concerns, like the newly suggested Mobility header format for Mobile IPv6.</t>
