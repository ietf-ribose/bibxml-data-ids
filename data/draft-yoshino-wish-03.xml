      <t>This document defines a general purpose message framing named WiSH which supports bi-directional (bidi) message-based communication over byte-stream oriented protocols such as HTTP (in its standard semantics). WiSH is designed to be compatible with WebSocket. WiSH can be viewed as a binary and bidi alternative to the framing defined for the server-sent events (SSE, EventSource) Web API [SSE].</t>
