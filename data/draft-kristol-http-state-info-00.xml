      <t>HTTP, the protocol that underpins the World-Wide Web (WWW), is stateless. That is, each request stands on its own; origin servers don't need to remember what happened with previous requests to service a new one. Statelessness is a mixed blessing, because there are potential WWW applications, like ``shopping baskets'' and library browsing, for which the history of a user's actions is useful or essential. This proposal outlines a way to introduce state into HTTP. A new request/response header, State-Info, carries the state back and forth, thus relieving the origin server from needing to keep an extensive per-user or per-connection database. The changes required to user agents, origin servers, and proxy servers to support State-Info are very modest.</t>
