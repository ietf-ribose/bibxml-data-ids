    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a schema, object classes, and attributes, for Printers and print services, for use with directories that support the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (RFC 4510). This document is based on the Printer attributes listed in Appendix E of "Internet Printing Protocol/1.1: Model and Semantics" (RFC 2911). Additional Printer attributes are based on definitions in "Printer MIB v2" (RFC 3805), "PWG Command Set Format for IEEE 1284 Device ID v1.0" (PWG 5107.2), "IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 3 (JPS3)" (PWG 5100.13), and "IPP Everywhere" (PWG 5100.14). This memo is an Independent Submission to the RFC Editor by the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) Working Group of the IEEE-ISTO Printer Working Group (PWG), as part of their PWG "IPP Everywhere" (PWG 5100.14) project for secure mobile printing with vendor-neutral Client software. This document obsoletes RFC 3712.</t>
