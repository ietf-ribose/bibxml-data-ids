      <t>SIP already provides the ability to perform hop-by-hop traceroute for SIP messages using the Max-Forwards header field, in order to determine the reachability path of requests to a target. A new mechanism for media-loopback calls is also being defined separately, which enables test calls to be generated which result in media being looped back to the originator. This document is a strawman proposal for a means of performing hop-by-hop traceroute-style test calls using the media-loopback mechanism, in order to test the media path when SIP sessions go through media-relaying B2BUAs.</t>
