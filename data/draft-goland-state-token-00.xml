    <abstract>
      <t>There are times when a principal will want to predicate successful execution of a method on the current state of a resource. While HTTP/1.1 provides a mechanism for conditional execution of methods using entity tags via the 'If-Match' and 'If-None-Match' headers, the mechanism is not sufficiently extensible to express conditional statements involving more generic state indicators, such as lock tokens. This draft defines the term 'state token' as an identifier for a state of a resource. This draft defines requirements for state tokens and provides a state token syntax, along with two new headers which are used to express method preconditions using state tokens.</t>
