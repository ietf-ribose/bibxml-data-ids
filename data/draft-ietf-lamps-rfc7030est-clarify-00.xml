    <abstract>
      <t>This document updates RFC7030: Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) to resolve some errata that was reported, and which has proven to have interoperability when RFC7030 has been extended. This document deprecates the specification of "Content-Transfer- Encoding" headers for EST endpoints, providing a way to do this in an upward compatible way. This document fixes some syntactical errors in ASN.1 that was presented.</t>
