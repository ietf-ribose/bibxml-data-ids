      <t>In DSR, a node can generate a route reply in response to a received route request if it has a fresh route to the destination in its route cache. However, this can incur the cached route reply problem and DSR just tries to mitigate this problem by reducing the possibility of cached route reply collisions. This document describes how DSR can be extended for the resolution of the cached route reply problem.</t>
