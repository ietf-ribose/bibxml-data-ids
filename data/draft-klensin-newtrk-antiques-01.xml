      <t>RFC 2026 and some of its predecessors require that Proposed and DraftStandards either advance in grade within a reasonable period of timeor that they expire and be moved to Historic. That procedure hasnever been followed on a systematic basis. A new procedure has beenproposed that would make that action easier for protocols that havenot gotten any real acceptance. In the interest of symmetry,fairness, and an orderly attic, it is worth noting that there are anumber of protocol descriptions which have been at less than FullStandard level for a long time but which have proven their value bythe traditional criteria of multiple interoperable implementationsThis document provides a procedure for upgrading such documents toFull Standards without creating an unreasonable burden on authorspurely to meet the needs of procedural rituals or placing anunreasonable load on groups charged with performing other tasks inthe IETF.</t>
