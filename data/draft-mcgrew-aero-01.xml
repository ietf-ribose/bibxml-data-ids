      <t>This document describes Authenticated Encryption with Replay prOtection (AERO), a cryptographic technique that provides all of the essential security services needed for communication security. AERO offers several advantages over other methods: it has more compact messages, provides stronger misuse resistance, avoids the need to manage implicit state, and is simpler to use. This document defines a particular AERO algorithm as well as a registry for such algorithms.</t>
