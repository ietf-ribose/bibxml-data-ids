      <t>To deliver reliable service, multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) requires a set of procedures to enable protection of the traffic carried on label switched paths (LSPs). Thus existing signaling mechanisms must be extended appropriately to support such functionality. Recently, CR-LDP [1] has introduced extensions to LDP to support the establishment of LSP tunnels. This draft extends CR- LDP to support path protection [2]in MPLS. Specifically, we provide signaling support for establishing working and backup LSPs.</t>
