    <abstract>
      <t>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are critical infrastructure for improving user experience by serving content from geographically proximate servers. Traditional CDN node selection mechanisms, such as DNS-based redirection and BGP-based anycast, primarily rely on network proximity and often lack awareness of server load or specific application requirements. This can lead to suboptimal performance and inefficient resource utilization. This document proposes an enhanced mechanism for dynamic CDN node selection that leverages IPv4/v6 anycast, BGP, and the QUIC transport protocol. The proposed solution enables CDN nodes to advertise or withdraw their anycast routes based on real-time load and link quality. Furthermore, it defines a mechanism for clients to signal their service requirements (e.g., high-compute, low-latency, or high- bandwidth) and for servers to redirect clients to more optimal nodes using QUIC's connection migration capabilities. This allows for a more intelligent, load-aware, and application-aware CDN node selection process.</t>
