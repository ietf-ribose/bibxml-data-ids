      <t>This document defines the "XML2RFC" version 3 vocabulary: an XML- based language used for writing RFCs and Internet-Drafts. It is heavily derived from the version 2 vocabulary that is also under discussion. This document obsoletes the v2 grammar described in RFC 2629 and its followup, draft-iab-xml2rfcv2. Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor) Discussion of this draft takes place on the rfc-interest mailing list (rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org), which has its home page at &lt;https://www.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rfc-interest&gt;.</t>
