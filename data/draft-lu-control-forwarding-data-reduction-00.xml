      <t>Data exchange between the control plane and the forwarding plane becomes the bottleneck of modern routers in terms of scalability and convergence. This paper describes a method which reduces the volume of information transferred from the control plane to the forwarding plane. The reduction has no impact on routing table precision, but it brings up the convergence speed significantly.</t>
