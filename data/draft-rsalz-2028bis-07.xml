      <t>This document describes the individuals and organizations involved in the IETF standards process, as described in IETF BCP 9. It includes brief descriptions of the entities involved, and the role they play in the standards process. The IETF and its structure have undergone many changes since 1996, when RFC 2028 was published. This document reflects the changed organizational structure of the IETF and obsoletes RFC 2028.</t>
