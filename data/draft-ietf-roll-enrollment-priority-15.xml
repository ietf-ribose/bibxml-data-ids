    <abstract>
      <t>[RFC9032] defines a method by which a potential [RFC9031] enrollment proxy can announce itself as available for new RPL nodes to enroll on a network. The announcement includes a priority for enrollment. This document provides a mechanism by which a Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) Root can globally disable enrollment announcements or adjust the base priority for enrollment operations.</t>
