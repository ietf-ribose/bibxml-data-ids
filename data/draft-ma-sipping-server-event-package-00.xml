      <t>This document defines the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server even package for SIP server farm using the SIP event framework. The SIP server event package allows clients to subscribe to the servers for server information in the server farm, and serves to communicate information with each other. Based on this, an overall view of the SIP server farm is built and delivered to the entity (including SIP phone proxy or other SIP servers) which subscribes and receives the event packages. The view would help failover and load balancing in the server farm. The event notification mechanism of SIP event framework guarantees its adaption to the dynamic changes of server state. We instantiate the usage of SIP server event package in three scenarios: client based failover, DNS based failover, load balancer based load balancing. To be added, we introduce some specific usage in Peer-to-Peer SIP(P2PSIP) and service discovery to expand and explore the potential usage space. Compared with the failover and load balancing mechanisms in traditional SIP, the new SIP event package would apply its explicit and dynamic notification mechanism to improve the efficiency and service availability of SIP server farm. This mechanism using server event package can also be a complementary way for the DNS functionality defined in RFC 3263[RFC 3263] to locate SIP servers.</t>
