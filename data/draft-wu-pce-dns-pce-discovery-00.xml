      <t>Discovery of the (Path Computation Element (PCE) within an IGP area or domain is possible using OSPF [RFC5088] and IS-IS [RFC5089]. However, in some deployment scenarios PCEs may not wish, or be able, to participate within the IGP process. Therefore it would be beneficial for the Path Computation Client (PCC) to discover PCEs via an alternative mechanism to those proposed in [RFC5088] and [RFC5089]. This document specifies the requirements, use cases, procedures and extensions to support DNS for PCE discovery.</t>
