      <t>This document discusses a number of the administrative issues that must be resolved before effective deployment of ENUM[2,3] services in complex environments with number portability and multiple providers for using DNS for translation of E.164 (telephone) numbers. North America is examined critically because its environment may be more complex than most and because current deregulation trends may drive other countries/regions in similar directions. In particular the current mechanisms for number administration and number portability in North America will require establishment of a new administrative function for managing the domain name entries for ported numbers.</t>
