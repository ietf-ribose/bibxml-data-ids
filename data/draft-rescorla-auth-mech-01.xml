      <t>Authentication is perhaps the most basic security problem for design-ers of network protocols. Even the early Internet protocols such asTELNET and FTP, which provided no other security services, made pro-vision for user authentication. Unfortunately, these early authenti-cation systems were wholly inadequate for the Internet Threat Model[REF] and a vast array of other authentication mechanisms have beenintroduced in an attempt to close these holes.The most striking thing about these security mechanisms is how manyof them are essentially similar. There are only 7 basic classes ofauthentication protocol but there are a large number of slightly dif-ferent protocols with essentially the same security properties. Thismemo surveys the space of authentication mechanisms, describes thebasic classes and provides examples of protocols which fit into eachclass.</t>
