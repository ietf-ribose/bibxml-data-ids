      <t>Interoperability for connected things is improving in a number of important areas, converging around Internet Protocol (IP) and internet design patterns. Hypermedia is becoming more common with web linking becoming part of a number of important standards. However, there is still an interoperability gap in how application semantics are defined and used. Many organizations and industry alliances are defining vocabulary and taxonomy for application domains, independent of each other. These vocabularies are often bound to particular conceptual models, and are often semantically incompatible with each other. While it may be possible to adapt protocols and convert representations, it is difficult to develop a common application framework that works across ecosystems and domains. This article proposes a method that can be reused across application domains and across ecosystems, to define a shared conceptual model and common vocabulary. A public resource is described which does for connected things what schema.org does for web commerce, to provide a community driven vocabulary and simple ontology that enables web scale interoperability between applications and connected things.</t>
