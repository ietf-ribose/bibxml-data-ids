      <t>This document is written to aid the process of selecting and completing the definition of the MIDCOM protocol, which will operate between MIDCOM agents and middleboxes such as firewalls and NATs. It describes the semantics which the protocol must support. These semantics are derived from the MIDCOM requirements and the MIDCOM usage scenarios which helped to inspire the requirements. This document was derived from draft-taylor-midcom-semantics-00.txt. The present version incorporates tentative conclusions reached in discussion at the IETF 54 meeting of the MIDCOM WG. It removes the concrete expression of the MIDCOM requests, responses, and notifications in favour of those presented in draft-stiemerling- midcom-semantics-xx.txt.</t>
