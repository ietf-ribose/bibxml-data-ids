      <t>This document details an RSVP Policy Element that provides a mechanism by which RSVP reservation establishment can be reliably confirmed, end-to-end. This Policy Element provides a status update with each PATH message refresh, useful for determining the lifetime of a reservation end-to-end. Such a policy element will be useful for accounting and billing applications that are interested in reliably knowing when a reservation has been successfully established end-to-end and when a reservation is finally removed.</t>
