      <t>Where the source and/or destination node of an IPv6 communication ismulti-addressed, a mechanism is required for the initiating node toselect the most appropriate address pair for the communication. RFC3484 (IPv6 Default Address Selection) [RFC3484] defines such amechanism for nodes to perform source and destination addressselection. While RFC3484 recognised the need for implementations tobe able to change the policy table, it did not define how this couldbe achieved. Requirements have now emerged for administrators to beable to dynamically change the RFC 3484 policy tables from a centralcontrol point, and for nomadic hosts to be able to obtain the policyfor the network that they are currently attached to without manualuser intervention. This text discusses considerations for suchpolicy changes, including examples of cases where a change of policyis required, and the likely frequency of such policy changes. Thistext also includes some discussion on the need to also update RFC3484, where default policies are currently defined.</t>
