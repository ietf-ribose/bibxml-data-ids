      <t>This Internet Draft presents a framework for further development of QoS signaling in the Internet. We give a basic model for the entities involved in QoS signaling, which is intended to be applicable to a very wide range of networking environments, while still retaining the flexibility to allow lightweight implementations in particular environments and incremental deployment in the Internet as a whole.</t>
