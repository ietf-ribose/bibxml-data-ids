    <abstract>
      <t>Link hints are going to be standardized to enhance interactions between link and network layers, allowing a given node to integrate and efficiently manage one or even several network interfaces. Parameters conveyed in Link Hints shall provide the necessary abstraction level to be mapped on several technologies. This document provides a first list of parameters to be transported in Link Hints but the way to transport them is out of the scope of this document. Two sets of parameters are proposed: the MN set gathers information available at the Mobile Node whereas the AR set is relevant for the Access Router side. In each set, parameters are grouped into three distinct categories: static parameters are related to the hardware implementation of the interface, configuration parameters are manageable through interface configuration, status parameters are highly varying as they provide the current link environment of the interface.</t>
