      <t>This draft proposes a new mechanism for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) over Mobile IPv6. In this mechanism, a home agent (HA) on home subnet acts as a redirect server and a registrar for SIP as well as a home router for Mobile IPv6. Thus, a binding cache in the HA contains location information for SIP as well as home registration entries for Mobile IPv6. An access router on foreign subnet acts as only a router that offers a domain name. To implement the proposed mechanism, some messages used in network layer are newly defined, such as a router advertisement, a router solicitation and a binding update. In the proposed mechanism, a mobile node doesn't require dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) and thus both home and foreign subnets don't need DHCP servers, unlike existing mechanisms on Mobile IPv4.</t>
