      <t>Artificial intelligence (AI) agents increasingly take autonomous actions — submitting forms, initiating payments, and sending communications — on behalf of human users across third-party services. This document defines the Delegated Agent Authorization Protocol (DAAP), an open, model-neutral, framework-agnostic protocol that specifies: cryptographic agent identity using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs); a human-consent-based grant authorization flow modelled on OAuth 2.0; a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) grant token format with agent-specific claims; a revocation model with online verification; a hash-chained append-only audit trail; a policy engine for automated authorization decisions; and a multi-agent delegation model with cascade revocation. DAAP fills a gap unaddressed by existing OAuth 2.0 extensions: verifying that a specific human authorized a specific AI agent to perform a specific action, revoking that authorization in real time, and producing a tamper-evident record of what the agent did.</t>
