      <t>This document describes aspects of 'multi-tier' architecture, 'Grid-net', addressing architecture, 'address plane', 'address swapping','address option', and revises aspects of the security, precedence of the Standard Internet Protocol to suit newly development trend of Internet, Municipal Area Network, and 'Home-net'. This addressing architecture provides much more capacious address space by attached 32-bit 'Grid' IP address for transmitting datagram from sources to destinations, where hosts identified by twin 32-bit IP addresses, i.e. to provide 'non-private' 32-bit IP address for transmission in adding 'Grid' tier, and scalable service for data, voice, signaling, and multimedia. The proposed protocol provides of seamless integration with existing Internet, tier border address swapping for transmission throughout public Internet tier, IP address planes inside Grid-net for data, IP phone, mobile phone, wireless PAD, video and other multimedia applications, and IP address personality for personal computer, IP phone, mobile phone, wireless PAD, home control, monitoring, and multimedia equipments. The goal of this document is to implement a compatible protocol, to create new Internet Multimedia Environment, and to protect worldwide investment on network resources.</t>
