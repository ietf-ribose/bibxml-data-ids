      <t>The base Mobile IP allows a host to transparently send datagrams tomobile nodes as it would to any other nodes. Datagrams addressed tothe mobile are always routed via the Home Agent in the home network.However, as the mobile node moves away from its home network, it mayno longer be topologically close to its home agent. Routeoptimization [MIP-OPTIM] has been proposed to allow a host to sendpackets to the mobile as a mobile node (MN) moves, without having toroute the packets via the home agent each time. The mobile providesits current address to a host (or correspondent node, CN) that it iscommunicating with as it moves. The host updates the cache of themobile location with this new address and tunnels datagrams(addressed to the mobile) to the current address of the mobile.However not all correspondent nodes are capable of tunneling IPdatagrams as required by the route optimization mechanisms describedin [MIP-OPTIM]. More importantly, disclosing the current location (orCOA) of the mobile node to correspondent nodes is not alwaysdesirable, nor is the overhead of encapsulating datagram to the MNideal.</t>
