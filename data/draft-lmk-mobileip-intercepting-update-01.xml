    <abstract>
      <t>The base Mobile IP allows a host to transparently send datagrams to mobile nodes as it would to any other nodes. Datagrams addressed to the mobile are always routed via the Home Agent in the home network. However, as the mobile node moves away from its home network, it may no longer be topologically close to its home agent. Route optimization [MIP-OPTIM] has been proposed to allow a host to send packets to the mobile as a mobile node (MN) moves, without having to route the packets via the home agent each time. The mobile provides its current address to a host (or correspondent node, CN) that it is communicating with as it moves. The host updates the cache of the mobile location with this new address and tunnels datagrams (addressed to the mobile) to the current address of the mobile. However not all correspondent nodes are capable of tunneling IP datagrams as required by the route optimization mechanisms described in [MIP-OPTIM]. More importantly, disclosing the current location (or COA) of the mobile node to correspondent nodes is not always desirable, nor is the overhead of encapsulating datagram to the MN ideal.</t>
