      <t>This document specifies extensions to RDMA protocols to provide capabilities in support of enhanced remotely-directed data consistency. The extensions include a new operation supporting remote commitment to durability of remotely-managed buffers, which can provide enhanced guarantees and improve performance for low- latency storage applications. In addition to, and in support of these, extensions to local behaviors are described, which may be used to guide implementation, and to ease adoption. This document would extend the IETF Remote Direct Memory Access Protocol (RDMAP), RFC5040, and RDMA Protocol Extensions, RFC7306.</t>
