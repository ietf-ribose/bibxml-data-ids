      <t>On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) is a multicast routing protocol designed for ad hoc networks with mobile hosts. ODMRP is a mesh-based, rather than a conventional tree-based, multicast scheme and uses a forwarding group concept (only a subset of nodes forwards the multicast packets via scoped flooding). It applies on-demand procedures to dynamically build routes and maintain multicast group membership. ODMRP is well suited for ad hoc wireless networks with mobile hosts where bandwidth is limited, topology changes frequently and rapidly, and power is constrained.</t>
