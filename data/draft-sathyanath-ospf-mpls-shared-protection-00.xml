      <t>This document describes extensions to the OSPF[1]/OSPF-TE[2] protocol to support Sharing/Restoration information, using opaque LSAs. The extension presented here enables the source router to obtain a backup route to a destination such that minimal amount of protection bandwidth reservation is needed. In other words, we provide a method by which one may easily increase sharing of backup links significantly, without having to go through each and every possible backup route.</t>
