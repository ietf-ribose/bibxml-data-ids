      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) allows a user to communicate with a local SIP proxy and registrar, primarily for registration services and the execution of certain features. Currently, SIP allows for discovery of these servers through multicast or through static configuration. In many cases, it may be more useful for a SIP client to discover local SIP servers based on features supported by those servers. In this document, an alternate technique is specified based on Service Location Protocol (SLP). The document contains a short description of how to use SLP for service discovery, and a SIP service type template. The service type template defines the attributes and service URL for a SIP server advertisement, suitable for SIP clients to discover.</t>
