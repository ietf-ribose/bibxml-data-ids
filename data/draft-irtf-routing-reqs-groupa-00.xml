      <t>This note sets requirements for a new routing and addressing architecture for the Internet. These requirements were developed by the IRTF's Routing Research Group. This draft is the product of Group ~B, which is one of the subgroups in the IRTF-Routing Research Group working on requirements for routing solutions for the future. This document sets out requirements that we believe are important for a future routing architecture and routing protocols. The IRTF Routing Research Group (RRG) does not endorse this set of requirements or any other set of requirements as the one and only set of requirements.</t>
