      <t>This document specifies a transport-layer protocol for routing capability-oriented intent between cryptographically identified endpoints across heterogeneous trust domains. The protocol defines capability identifiers with mandatory versioning, scoped discovery across five visibility levels, ticket-based session authorization, negotiated cryptographic suites including hybrid post-quantum key establishment, encrypted peer-to-peer session establishment, and mutually attested invocation receipts with hash-chained integrity. Payload semantics are opaque to the transport layer. This revision clarifies session-level capability binding semantics, aligns discovery behavior with deployed FIND_EX wire formats, and refines session teardown security properties.</t>
