    <abstract>
      <t>Power of Attorney (PoA) based authorization is a generic and decentralized subgranting based authorization technique. In this, a principal can grant limited credibilities for an agent to act on its behalf for some limited time and context. This can be used for example with semi-autonomous devices to have them act on behalf. PoA is a self-contained document that a principal sign and directs to an agent, thereby providing it the power to execute user actions on behalf of the principal for a predefined time. In this document, we compare PoA based authorization with different existing internet protocols for authorization and the relation with existing identity solutions.</t>
