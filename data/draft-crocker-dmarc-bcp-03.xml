      <t>Email abuse often relies on unauthorized use of a domain name, such as one belonging to a well-known company (brand). SPF and DKIM provide basic domain name authentication methods for email. A recent industry effort built an additional authentication-based layer, called Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance (DMARC). It allows a sender to indicate that their emails are protected by SPF and/or DKIM, and tells a receiver what to do if neither of those authentication methods passes; it also provides a reporting mechanism, from receivers back to domain owners. Such capabilities over the public Internet are unusual and their use is not yet well-understood. This document formulates a set of best practices for the use of DMARC.</t>
