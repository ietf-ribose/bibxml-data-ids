      <t>This document defines the purchase exchange format (PEF), which consists of signed purchase records, to enable sharing, verification, and transfer of information about license ownership. This enables sharing of subscriptions, rentals, and one-time-purchases across platforms as well as deleting or switching accounts of (media) service providers without loosing or double-purchasing products. It can also be applied to non-media items and physical objects like family-shared rentals of tools or proof of purchase for guarantee claims.</t>
