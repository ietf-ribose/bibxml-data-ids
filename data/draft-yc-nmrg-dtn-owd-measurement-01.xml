      <t>This document implements an accurate network delay measurement method based on the digital twin network. This is a use case of digital twin network. This method does not need to send measurement packets, does not need to change the physical network configuration, does not need to change the format of service packets, do not require physical network elements to support the time synchronization protocol, and support the one-way delay measurement of any service packet.The digital twin network architecture of this document follows the NMRG working group paper draft-irtf-nmrg-network-digital-twin-arch-00.</t>
