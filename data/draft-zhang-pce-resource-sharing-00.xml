      <t>Resource sharing in a network means two or more Label Switched Paths (LSPs) use common piece(s) of resource along their paths. This can help save network resource and useful in scenarios such as LSP recovery or two LSPs do not need to be active at the same time. A Path Computation Element (PCE) is a centralized entity, responsible for path calculation. Given this feature and its access to the network resource information and possibly active LSPs information, it can be used to support resource-sharing-based path computation with better efficiency. This document extends the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) in order to support resource sharing-based path computation.</t>
