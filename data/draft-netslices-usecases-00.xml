    <abstract>
      <t>Network Slicing is meant to enable creating (end-to-end) partitioned network infrastructure which may include the user equipment, access/ core transport networks, edge and central data center resources to provide differentiated connectivity behaviors to fulfill the requirements of distinct services, applications and customers. In this context, connectivity is not restricted to differentiated forwarding capabilities but it covers also advanced service functions that will be invoked when transferring data within a given domain. The purpose of this document is to focus on use cases that benefit from the usefulness of network slicing.</t>
