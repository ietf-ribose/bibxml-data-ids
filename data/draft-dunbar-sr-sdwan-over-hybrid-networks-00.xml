    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a method for end-to-end (E2E) SD-WAN paths (most likely encrypted) to traverse specific list of network segments, some of which may be legacy networks that do not support SR, to achieve the desired optimal E2E quality. The method described in this draft uses the principle of segment routing to enforce the SD-WAN paths' head ends selecting paths traversing through a list of specific nodes of multiple network segments without requiring the nodes in each network segments to have the intelligence (or maintaining states) of selecting next hop or next domain. Those networks over which the SD-WAN path traverse may have different data planes (some maybe IPv4, others maybe IPv6 or MPLS) and can be owned &amp; managed by different network service providers (SP).</t>
