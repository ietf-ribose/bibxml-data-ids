      <t>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhancements to existing VPN services to support the needs of new applications, particularly including the applications that are associated with 5G services. VPN+ could be used to provide network slicing, and may also be of use in more generic scenarios, such as enterprise services which have demanding requirement. With the requirement for VPN+ services increase, scalability would become an important factor for the deployment of VPN+. This document describes the scalability considerations in the control plane and data plane to enable VPN+ services, some optimization mechanisms are also described.</t>
