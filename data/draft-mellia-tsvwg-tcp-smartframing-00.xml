      <t>In this document we present an enhancement to the TCP protocol, called TCP Smart Framing, or TCP-SF for short, that enables the Fast Retransmit/Recovery algorithm even when the congestion window is small, i.e., for short-lived flows, as most of the current Internet traffic is. Without modifying the TCP congestion control based on the additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease paradigm, TCP-SF adopts a novel segmentation algorithm: while Classic TCP starts sending IW segments, a TCP-SF source is allowed to always send an initial window of 4 smaller segments, whose aggregate payload is equal to the connection's SMSS. This key idea can be implemented on top of any TCP flavor, from Tahoe to SACK, and requires modifications to the server behavior only.</t>
