      <t>This document provides a terminology for benchmarking SIP performancein networking devices. Terms are included for test components, testsetup parameters, and performance benchmark metrics for black-boxbenchmarking of SIP networking devices. The performance benchmarkmetrics are obtained for the SIP control plane and media plane. Theterms are intended for use in a companion methodology document forcomplete performance characterization of a device in a variety ofconditions making it possible to compare performance of differentdevices. It is critical to provide test setup parameters and amethodology document for SIP performance benchmarking because SIPallows a wide range of configuration and operational conditions thatcan influence performance benchmark measurements. It is necessary tohave terminology and methodology standards to ensure that reportedbenchmarks have consistent definition and were obtained following thesame procedures. Benchmarks can be applied to compare performance ofa variety of SIP networking devices.</t>
