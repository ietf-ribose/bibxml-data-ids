    <abstract>
      <t>Some recent use cases seem to have a need for carrying IDs within packets. Two examples are _I-D.draft-ietf-6man-enhanced-vpn-vtn-id_ and _I-D.draft-li-6man-topology-id_. While they might perfectly make sense on their own, each document requires IANA to allocate a new code point for a new option, which could quickly exhaust the allocation space if similar designs are proposed in the future. As an example, one might need an 8-bit ID, while another one might need a 24-bit, 32-bit, or 64-bit ID. Or, even worse, one might need a 32-bit ID in a specific context, while someone else might also need a 32-bit ID in another context. Therefore, allocating a new code point for each similar option is probably not the way to go.</t>
