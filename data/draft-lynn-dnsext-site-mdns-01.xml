      <t>Multicast DNS (mDNS) provides the ability to perform DNS-likeoperations on the local link in the absence of any conventionalunicast DNS server. Extended mDNS (xmDNS) extends the specificationof mDNS to site-local scope in order to support multi-hop LANs thatforward multicast packets but do not provide a unicast DNS service.Like mDNS, xmDNS designates a portion of the DNS namespace to applyto the site-local network and specifies rules for its use.</t>
