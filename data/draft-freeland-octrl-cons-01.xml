      <t>Work on extensions to IP control protocols for reuse in the control plane of optical transport networks has now been underway for around a year in the MPLS and IPO groups. Recent discussions have however highlighted a lack of defined requirements that should be met by candidate protocols being considered for the optical control plane. Indeed, there have been several requests for carriers to submit their requirements. This draft provides one view of some (but by no means all) of these requirements. A protocol independent approach is taken, and the authors recommend that the design of any particular facet of an optical control plane should take into account the considerations made in this document.</t>
