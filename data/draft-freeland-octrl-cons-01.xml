      <t>Work on extensions to IP control protocols for reuse in the controlplane of optical transport networks has now been underway for arounda year in the MPLS and IPO groups. Recent discussions have howeverhighlighted a lack of defined requirements that should be met bycandidate protocols being considered for the optical control plane.Indeed, there have been several requests for carriers to submittheir requirements. This draft provides one view of some (but by nomeans all) of these requirements. A protocol independent approachis taken, and the authors recommend that the design of anyparticular facet of an optical control plane should take intoaccount the considerations made in this document.</t>
