      <t>This memo describes a PIM routing problem owing to the reverse path forwarding (RPF) failure on routers having multiple addresses on a link. This memo also considers possible solutions with their pros and cons. The solutions include operational one which does not require any protocol change, and one which uses a new PIM Hello option. However, it is beyond the scope of this memo to discuss what is the most appropriate solution for this problem.</t>
