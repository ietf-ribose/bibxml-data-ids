      <t>This memo describes a PIM routing problem owing to the reverse pathforwarding (RPF) failure on routers having multiple addresses on alink. This memo also considers possible solutions with their prosand cons. The solutions include operational one which does notrequire any protocol change, and one which uses a new PIM Hellooption. However, it is beyond the scope of this memo to discuss whatis the most appropriate solution for this problem.</t>
