      <t>There have been several attempts aimed at developing an Arabic Domain Name System (ADNS) using Arabic characters in an Arabic-language coherent fashion. In the beginning of the second quarter of 2003, an Arabic Domain Name Task Force (ADNTF) was formed under the auspices of United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), and the guidance of Multilingual Internet Names Consortium (MINC); one of its main objectives was to help define standards for ADNS through a Request For Comments (RFC) document. This document resolves many technical and linguistic issues, including the adoption of the client-side DNS-based approach to name resolution; syntax of the proposed Arabic Domain Names together with the character set and many Arabic language-specific issues were clearly resolved. This Internet-Draft proposes guidelines that are compatible with the Internet Consortium for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as far as Domain Names System (DNS) and Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) standards are concerned. Technical, management, operational, and language-specific issues are discussed and recommendations are made.</t>
