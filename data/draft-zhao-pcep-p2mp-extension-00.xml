    <abstract>
      <t>Point-to-point Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) may be established using signaling techniques, but their paths may first be determined. The Path Computation Element (PCE) has been identified as an appropriate technology for the determination of the paths of P2MP TE LSPs. This document describes extensions to the PCE Communication Protocol PCEP) to handle requests and responses for the computation of paths for P2MP TE LSPs. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</t>
