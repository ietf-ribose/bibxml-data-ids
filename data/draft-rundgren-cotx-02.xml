      <t>This document describes a CBOR tag for providing type information to CBOR data. Unlike the native CBOR tagging scheme which builds on integer constants defined in a IANA registry, this specification supports arbitrary text based type identifiers. Such identifiers may consequently also be expressed as URLs, potentially pointing to Web pages holding related descriptions in human readable form, as well as being compatible with established methods for adding type information to JSON and XML data.</t>
