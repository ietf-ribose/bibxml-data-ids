    <abstract>
      <t>This document enumerates a base set of requirements to be included in any system that provides registration information for Internet registration entities, i.e., network and/or domain name assignments. Some of these, in turn, will define requirements for registrars; this, however, is an issue outside of the scope of this document. It is hoped that this work will also influence the development of requirements and specifications for domain name registries at some point in the future.</t>
