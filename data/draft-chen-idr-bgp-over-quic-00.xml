      <t>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is an autonomous system routing protocol. The main function of BGP is to exchange routing and reachability information between autonomous systems(AS) on the Internet. BGP uses TCP to implement reliable and orderly transmission of information. Similar to TCP, QUIC is a UDP-based, byte-stream-based reliable data transmission service. In addition, by integrating with TLS 1.3, QUIC also supports functions such as establishing connections with minimum latency and providing confidentiality and integrity protection for the transmitted data, and multi-stream multiplexing. Taking use of QUIC for BGP can achieve the possible advantages. This document defines the mechanism of BGP over QUIC to and corresponding procedures.</t>
