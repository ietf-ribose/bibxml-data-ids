      <t>As a major transport protocol of current Internet, TCP has the problem of the large header overhead on bandwidth-limited links. Header compression has been proven to be efficient for using TCP over bandwidth-limited reliable links. Unfortunately, existing TCP/IP header compression schemes do not work well on noisy links, especially the one with high bit error rate and long roundtrip time. In addition, existing schemes [2, 3] have not addressed some TCP options such as SACK [4, 5] and Timestamps [6].</t>
