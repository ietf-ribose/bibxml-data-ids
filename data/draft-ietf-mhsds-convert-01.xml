      <t>User Agents have various capabilities for support of multimedia messages. To facilitate interworking between UAs of differing capabilities, it is useful for the MTS to be able to perform content conversion. This document specifies an approach for X.400 Message Handling Systems to perform application level routing using the OSI Directory in order to support content conversion. This document assumes MHS use of directory to perfom routing accoreding to ``MHS use of Directory to support MHS Routing''. This draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as a protocol standard. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Please send comments to the author or to the discussion group &lt;mhs-ds@mercury.udev.cdc.com&gt;.</t>
