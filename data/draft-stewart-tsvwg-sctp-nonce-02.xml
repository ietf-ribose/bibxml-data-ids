      <t>This document describes the addition of the ECN-nonce RFC 3540[RFC3540] to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) RFC 2960[RFC2960]. The ECN-nonce reduces the vulnerability of ECN senders tomisbehaving receivers that conceal congestion signals like ECN marksand packet losses. The ECN-nonce approach is different in SCTPbecause SCTP uses chunks for extensible protocol features and isselective acknowlegement (SACK)-based; this document describes thosedifferences. In particular this document describes (1) protocolextensions in the form of a single new parameter for the INIT/INIT-ACK chunks, and a single bit flag in the SACK chunk, and (2)rules governing the sender and receiver side implementation.This document outlines a minimum response that an SCTP sender shouldapply after detecting a misbehaving receiver.</t>
