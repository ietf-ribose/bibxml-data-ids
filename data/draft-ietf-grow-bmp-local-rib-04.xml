      <t>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines access to the Adj-RIB-In and locally originated routes (e.g. routes distributed into BGP from protocols such as static) but not access to the BGP instance Loc-RIB. This document updates the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) RFC 7854 by adding access to the BGP instance Local-RIB, as defined in RFC 4271 the routes that have been selected by the local BGP speaker's Decision Process. These are the routes over all peers, locally originated, and after best-path selection.</t>
