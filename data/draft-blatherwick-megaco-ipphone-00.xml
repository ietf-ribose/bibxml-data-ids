      <t>This document is a proposal to add new event/signal packages and termi-nation classes to the Megaco protocol [3], to support an IP telephoneMG. The proposal covers the requirements (section 3), design approach(section 4) and resource/termination model (section 5) to be used for IPtelephones. The new event/signal packages and termination classes aredefined in sections 6 and 7 respectively. Megaco protocol issuesaffecting effective implementation of IP telephones, includingcomplexity, reliable transport, message encoding, security and othersare presented in section 8. The proposal represents a current view fromthe TIA working group on IP telephone specification, TIA TR-41.3.4, withthe intent of using this as part of its 'whole device' specification asa method of device control.</t>
