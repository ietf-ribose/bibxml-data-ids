      <t>Some bridge products perform a feature known as "VLAN mapping", in which a bridge translates a data frame's VLAN ID from one VLAN to another when it forwards a frame from one port to another. This feature facilitates scenarios such as combining two bridged LANs with overlapping VLAN IDs into one bridged LAN without merging two communities just because they have been given the same VLAN ID in the original two clouds. This document describes how RBridges can achieve the same functionality.</t>
