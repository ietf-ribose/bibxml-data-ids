    <abstract>
      <t>This memo presents a set of extensions for supporting explicit rate congestion control using RSVP. It should be perceived as an extension to the RSVP functional specifications [RFC2205] These extensions include the standard format of the ER_SPEC object, and a description of RSVP's handling of the ER_SPEC object. This document does not advocate a particular distributed explicit rate congestion control algorithm.</t>
