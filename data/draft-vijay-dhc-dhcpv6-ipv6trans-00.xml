      <t>For the newly deployed IPv6 networks to interoperate with vastly deployed IPv4 networks, various transition mechanisms had been proposed. One such mechanism is configured tunnels. This document provides a mechanism by which the DHCPv6 servers can provide information about the various configured tunnel end points to reach the IPv6 nodes which are separated by IPv4 networks.</t>
