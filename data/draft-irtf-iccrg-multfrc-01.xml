      <t>This document specifies the MulTFRC congestion control mechanism.MulTFRC is derived from TFRC and can be implemented by carrying out afew small and simple changes to the original mechanism. Its behaviordiffers from TFRC in that it emulates a number of TFRC flows withmore flexibility than what would be practical or even possible usingmultiple real TFRC flows. Additionally, MulTFRC better preserves theoriginal features of TFRC than multiple real TFRCs do.</t>
