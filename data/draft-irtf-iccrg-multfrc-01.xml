    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the MulTFRC congestion control mechanism. MulTFRC is derived from TFRC and can be implemented by carrying out a few small and simple changes to the original mechanism. Its behavior differs from TFRC in that it emulates a number of TFRC flows with more flexibility than what would be practical or even possible using multiple real TFRC flows. Additionally, MulTFRC better preserves the original features of TFRC than multiple real TFRCs do.</t>
