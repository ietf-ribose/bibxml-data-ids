      <t>The memo tries to identify the problems and issues in the use of IPv6 anycast [Hinden, 1998] defined as of today. The goals of the draft are (1) to understand the currently-defined IPv6 anycast better, (2) to provide guidelines for people trying to deploy anycast services, and (3) to suggest updates to IPv6 anycast protocol specification. The document was made possible by input from ipngwg DNS discovery design team.</t>
