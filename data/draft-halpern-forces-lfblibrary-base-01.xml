      <t>The Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) working group is defining a protocol to allow a Control Element (CE) to control the behavior of a Forwarding Element (FE). The manipulations used by this protocol operate in terms of adjustments to Logical Function Blocks (LFBs) whose structure is defined my a model RFC produced by the working group. In order to build an actual solution using this protocol, there needs to be a set of Logical Function Block definitions that can be instantiated by FEs and controlled by CEs. This document provides an initial set of such definitions. It is anticipated that additional defining documents will be produced over time.</t>
