      <t>The Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) working groupis defining a protocol to allow a Control Element (CE) to control thebehavior of a Forwarding Element (FE). The manipulations used bythis protocol operate in terms of adjustments to Logical FunctionBlocks (LFBs) whose structure is defined my a model RFC produced bythe working group. In order to build an actual solution using thisprotocol, there needs to be a set of Logical Function Blockdefinitions that can be instantiated by FEs and controlled by CEs.This document provides an initial set of such definitions. It isanticipated that additional defining documents will be produced overtime.</t>
