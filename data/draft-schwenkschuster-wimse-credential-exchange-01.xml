      <t>WIMSE defines Workload Identity and its representation through credentials. Typically, a credential is provisioned to the workload, allowing it to represent itself. The credential format is usually chosen by the platform. Common formats are JSON Web Tokens or X.509 certificates. However, workloads often encounter situations where a different identity or credential is required. This document describes various situations where a workload requires another credential. It also outlines different ways this can be acchieved and compares them.</t>
