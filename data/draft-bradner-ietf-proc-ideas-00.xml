    <abstract>
      <t>The problem working group has shown that a number of IETF participants feel that the current process by which the IETF approves documents for publication as RFCs needs to be changed. There does not seem to be consensus on specific reasons that change is needed but there seems to be consensus that change is needed. This document is designed to provide some ideas on different ways that the current processes could be revised. My intent is to spur discussion on possibilities, not to say (at this time) what my preference is.</t>
