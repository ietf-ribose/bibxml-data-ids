    <abstract>
      <t>The procedure to handle host mobility in a layer 2 Network with EVPN control plane is defined as part of RFC7432bis. EVPN has since evolved to find wider applicability across various IRB use cases that include distributing both MAC and IP reachability via a common EVPN control plane. MAC Mobility procedures defined in RFC7432bis are extensible to IRB use cases if a fixed 1:1 mapping between VM IP and MAC is assumed across VM moves. Generic mobility support for IP and MAC addresses that allows these bindings to change across moves is required to support a broader set of EVPN IRB use cases. EVPN all- active multi-homing further introduces scenarios that require additional consideration from mobility perspective. This document enumerates a set of design considerations applicable to mobility across these EVPN IRB use cases and updates sequence number assignment procedures defined in RFC7432bis to address these IRB use cases. NOTE TO IESG (TO BE DELETED BEFORE PUBLISHING): This draft lists six authors which is above the required limit of five. Given significant and active contributions to the draft from all six authors over the course of six years, we would like to request IESG to allow publication with six authors. Specifically, the three Cisco authors are the original inventors of these procedures and contributed heavily to rev 0 draft, most of which is still intact. AT&amp;T is also a key contributor towards defining the use cases that this document addresses as well as the proposed solution. Authors from Nokia and Juniper have further contributed to revisions and discussions steadily over last six years to enable respective implementations and a wider adoption.</t>
