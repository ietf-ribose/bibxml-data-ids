      <t>This document describes a method to improve the bandwidth efficiency of voice transmission over an IP/MPLS network by combining RTP compression, PPP multiplexing and MPLS tunneling. This proposal does not require any additions or modifications to existing protocols, and therefore should be fully interoperable with existing implementations of RTP compression and PPP multiplexing. It only requires specific use of some attributes of MPLS signalling protocols to setup a pair of unidirectional MPLS tunnels providing a bidirectional link for compressed RTP over PPP.</t>
