      <t>Cloud services need to interoperate across cloud providers, service vendors and private/public domains. To enable this interoperability, there is need for a standard protocol for exchanging service information. This draft describes requirements for such a protocol. Current cloud implementations expose application level APIs, which are not syntactically and semantically compatible with each other. One approach to interoperate cloud services is to standardize the protocol while leaving the API definition implementation specific. Standard protocols have been used widely in the Internet and can be extended to cloud. Use of such protocols is compatible with existing cloud APIs, which can exchange information in a standard protocol. New APIs may also be developed using a standard protocol. By this, it would be possible to interoperate diverse APIs across service providers, service vendors and service users.</t>
