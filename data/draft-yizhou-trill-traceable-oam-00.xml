      <t>TRILL fault management [RFC7455] specifies the messages and operations for OAM in TRILL network. The sender collects the replies for the OAM-relevant request it sent and uses the replies as the indication of the network faults. In certain circumstances the sender needs to collect multiple replies to isolate the fault, e.g. repetitively sending Path Trace Messages (PTM) with increasing value of hop count and collecting the replies on them to figure out the fault point of certain path. With the increasing deployment of Software Defined Network (SDN), a centralized management server can be used to help with fault management. The server then is responsible to collect OAM messages and analyze them to either isolate the network fault or compile overall OAM information. It naturally uses SDN structure to alleviate the effort of the requester node and provide a centralized solution to produce the operation and management feedback of the network. This document specifies the extensions of TRILL OAM message and the operations about the network nodes and the centralized management server to trace and collect OAM relevant messages for further analysis.</t>
