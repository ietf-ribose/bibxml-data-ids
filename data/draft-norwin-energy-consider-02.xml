      <t>With rising cost and an increasing awareness of the environmentalimpact of energy consumption, a desirable feature of networkeddevices is to be able to assess their power state and energyconsumption at will. With this data available, one can buildsophisticated applications such as monitoring applications or evenactive energy management systems. These systems themselves are outof scope of this memo, as it discusses only considerations for themonitored devices. Implementation specifics such as the definitionof a Management Information Base are also outside the scope of thisdocument.</t>
