      <t>The fundamental problem in managing a large mailing list is matching bounce messages to subscription addresses. Often a bounce message refers to a failing address that does not appear on the mailing list. One of the mailing list subscribers is forwarding messages to that address. Which subscriber? As the list grows, this question becomes more and more difficult to answer. The owner hack completely eliminates this problem _right now_. It automatically and reliably identifies the subscription address relevant to each bounce message. It provides the address in a form that is trivial for automated bounce handlers to parse. It requires support from the local mailer, but it does not require support from any other hosts.</t>
