      <t>There are times when an LDAP search would return a DN-valued attribute with multiple values. As the number of values in a multi- value attribute increases, it becomes apparent that a way to query the multi-valued attribute is increasingly valuable. This document describes an LDAP extended search control that returns DN-valued attributes as objects and their respective attributes in the searchResultEntry and also allows filters to be applied to the values in a large multi-valued attribute. Using this control to search multi-valued attributes reduces the number of client round trips.</t>
