      <t>This specification defines the format of UUIDs (Universally Unique IDentifier), also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifier). A UUID is 128 bits long, and if generated according to the one of the mechanisms in this document, is either guaranteed to be different from all other UUIDs/GUIDs generated until 3400 A.D. or extremely likely to be different (depending on the mechanism chosen). UUIDs were originally used in the Network Computing System (NCS) [1] and later in the Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment [2]. This specification is derived from the latter specification with the kind permission of the OSF.</t>
