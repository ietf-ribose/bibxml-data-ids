      <t>This document establishes requirements for a protocol that enables intelligent devices to dynamically discover peer devices, to synchronize state with them, and to negotiate mutual configurations with them. The document then defines a general protocol for discovery, synchronization and negotiation, while the technical objectives for specific scenarios are to be described in separate documents. An Appendix briefly discusses existing protocols as possible alternatives.</t>
