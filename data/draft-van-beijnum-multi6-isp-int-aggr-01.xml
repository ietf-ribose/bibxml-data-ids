      <t>Current 6bone backbone routing guidelines prohibit traditionalmultihoming in IPv6, because current IPv4-style multihoming doesn'tscale. This stands in the way of successful adoption of IPv6. Thesolution outlined in this memo proposes aggregating the routinginformation for multihomed destinations inside service providernetworks based on geography to accomplish scalable multihoming in IPv6using current protocols and implementations. This solution does notrequire network operators to increase the density of interconnection;nor does it require significant cooperation or simultaneous adoption.</t>
