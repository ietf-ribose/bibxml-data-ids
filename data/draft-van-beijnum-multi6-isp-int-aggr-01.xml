      <t>Current 6bone backbone routing guidelines prohibit traditional multihoming in IPv6, because current IPv4-style multihoming doesn't scale. This stands in the way of successful adoption of IPv6. The solution outlined in this memo proposes aggregating the routing information for multihomed destinations inside service provider networks based on geography to accomplish scalable multihoming in IPv6 using current protocols and implementations. This solution does not require network operators to increase the density of interconnection; nor does it require significant cooperation or simultaneous adoption.</t>
