    <abstract>
      <t>Conference servers have many controls that change how the media is combined for the various conference participants. It is necessary to describe these controls to the clients connected to a centralized conference, so that the clients can render a user interface and allow the user to manipulate them. This work is being discussed on the xcon@ietf.org mailing list. This draft has not changed since the 02 version.</t>
