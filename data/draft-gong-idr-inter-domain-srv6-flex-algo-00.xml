    <abstract>
      <t>IGP Flexible Algorithm (Flex-Algo) provides a mechanism for IGP nodes to compute the best paths according to a set of constraints in both the topology and computation metrics. Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) can be used as one of the data plane of IGP Flex-Algo. In SRv6 networks, services may be carried across multiple network domains which are under the same administration. For some services, it is expected that the an end-to-end inter-domain path can be computed according to the same constraints (such as low latency) defined by Flex-Algo. This document describes BGP extensions to advertise SRv6 locators as IPv6 prefixes, together with the associated algorithm across the AS boundary.</t>
