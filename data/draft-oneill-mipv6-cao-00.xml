      <t>IPv6 and MIPv6 has constrained the HoA to being used within forward and reverse tunnels via the HA. In the unicast case, the MN can then activate Route Optimisation to bypass the HA in both directions by securely installing a Binding Cache Entry into the CN. The MN then sends from the CCoA source address to the CN directly into the foreign multicast system, and includes the Home Address Option (HAO) so that the changing CCoA is masked from the transport layer. This draft defines the Care of Address Option, which carries the current CCoA of the MN. The CAO can be included in a Hop By Hop Header or Destination header and used instead of the packet source address for unicast ingress filtering and multicast RPF purposes. This enables a MN to potentially use the HoA as a source address on the foreign network, and to inform the CNs of the evolving MN location.</t>
