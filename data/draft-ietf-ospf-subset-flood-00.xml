      <t>This memo defines a method for limiting the flooding of OSPF LSAs to a configurable subset of the network topology. The following OSPF properties are maintained: (1) routers are omitted from the routing calculation until their link-state databases are synchronized and (2) links must be bidirectional before they can be used in the calculation. Backward-compatibility with unmodified OSPF routers is also provided.</t>
