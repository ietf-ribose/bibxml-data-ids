      <t>This memo defines a method for limiting the flooding of OSPF LSAs toa configurable subset of the network topology. The following OSPFproperties are maintained: (1) routers are omitted from the routingcalculation until their link-state databases are synchronized and(2) links must be bidirectional before they can be used in thecalculation. Backward-compatibility with unmodified OSPF routers isalso provided.</t>
