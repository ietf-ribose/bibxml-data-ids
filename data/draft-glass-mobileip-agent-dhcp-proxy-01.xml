      <t>Since the inclusion of the Network Access Identifier (NAIs) intothe mobile ip fabric, home agents have had a way to identify mobilenodes which do not have home IP addresses. After authenticating theregistration request from such a mobile node, the home agent is thenexpected to assign a home addresses to the mobile node in theregistration reply to be used on a semi-permanent basis.Unfortunately, no specific mechanism has yet been proposed. Ideally,as DHCP centralizes address management, a home agent should contact aDHCP server to allocate an address for the mobile node, therebypreserving DHCP as the central address maintainer. The technologydoes exist for a Home Agent to use DHCP controlled addresses, namelyfor the Home Agent to behave as a DHCP proxy agent.</t>
