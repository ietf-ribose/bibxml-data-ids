      <t>Since the inclusion of the Network Access Identifier (NAIs) into the mobile ip fabric, home agents have had a way to identify mobile nodes which do not have home IP addresses. After authenticating the registration request from such a mobile node, the home agent is then expected to assign a home addresses to the mobile node in the registration reply to be used on a semi-permanent basis. Unfortunately, no specific mechanism has yet been proposed. Ideally, as DHCP centralizes address management, a home agent should contact a DHCP server to allocate an address for the mobile node, thereby preserving DHCP as the central address maintainer. The technology does exist for a Home Agent to use DHCP controlled addresses, namely for the Home Agent to behave as a DHCP proxy agent.</t>
