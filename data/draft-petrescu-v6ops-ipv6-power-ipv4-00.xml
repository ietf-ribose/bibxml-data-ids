    <abstract>
      <t>This draft documents preliminary results of measuring the power consumption of using IPv6 vs using IPv4 on typical applications on a smartphone. The smartphone is connected on a 4G cellular network with either an IPv6 connection, or with an IPv4 connection, but not both simultaneously. The preliminary results expose a roughly 5% increase in power consumption on IPv6. More experiments are planned as future work that may confirm or infirm these figures.</t>
