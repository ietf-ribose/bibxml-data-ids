      <t>The SIMPLE working group has developed a core set of specifications for messaging and presence functionality. However, those protocols alone are not sufficient to build a complete IM and presence application. In this document, we advocate a componentized model, whereby the other pieces of the system are very loosely coupled, and easily swapped out for others, in order to allow innovation and differentiation. We also propose some simple solutions for several of them to allow for interop.</t>
