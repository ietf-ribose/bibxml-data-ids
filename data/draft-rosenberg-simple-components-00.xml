      <t>The SIMPLE working group has developed a core set of specificationsfor messaging and presence functionality. However, those protocolsalone are not sufficient to build a complete IM and presenceapplication. In this document, we advocate a componentized model,whereby the other pieces of the system are very loosely coupled, andeasily swapped out for others, in order to allow innovation anddifferentiation. We also propose some simple solutions for several ofthem to allow for interop.</t>
