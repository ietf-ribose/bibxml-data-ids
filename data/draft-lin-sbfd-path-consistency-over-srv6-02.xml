    <abstract>
      <t>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) can be used to monitor paths between nodes. Seamless BFD (S-BFD) provides a simplified mechanism which is suitable for monitoring of paths that are setup dynamically and on a large scale network. In SRv6, when a headend use S-BFD to monitor the segment list/CPath of SRv6 Policy, the forward path of control packet is indicated by segment list, the reverse path of response control packet is via the shortest path from the reflector back to the initiator (headend) as determined by routing. The forward path and reverse path of control packet are likely inconsistent going through different intermediate nodes or links. This document describes a method to keep the forward path and reverse path of S-BFD consistent when detecting SRv6 Policy.</t>
