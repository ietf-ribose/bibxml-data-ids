      <t>It is an emerging demand to provide redundancy and load-sharing across wired and cellular links from a single service provider so that one customer is provided with "Hybrid Access" to the bonding of multiple heterogeneous connections. In this document, GRE (Generic Routing Encapsulation) Tunnel Bonding is specified as an enabling approach for Hybrid Access. In GRE Tunnel Bonding, GRE tunnels per network connections are set up and bonded together to form a single GRE tunnel for a subscriber. Compared with each composing connection, the bonding connection promises increased access capacity and improved reliability.</t>
