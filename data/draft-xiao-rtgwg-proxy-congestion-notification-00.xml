      <t>This document describes the necessity and feasibility to introduce a proxy network node between the congested network node and the traffic sender. The proxy network node is used to translate the congestion notification. The congested network node sends the congestion notification to the proxy network node in a format defined in this document, and the proxy network node translates the received congestion notification to a format known by the traffic sender and resends the translated congestion notification to the traffic sender.</t>
