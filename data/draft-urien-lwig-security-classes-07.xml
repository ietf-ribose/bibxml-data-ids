      <t>This draft attempts to define security classes for constraint IoT devices. A device security is characterized by five Boolean security attributes: one time programmable memory (OTP), firmware loader (FLD), secure firmware loader (FLD-SEC), tamper resistant key (TRT- KEY) and diversified key (DIV-KEY). This leads to the definition of 6 classes of devices, embedding or not OTP resource, whose security increases with the class number (0 to 5). The suffix + indicates OTP availability.</t>
