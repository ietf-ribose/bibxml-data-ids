      <t>Opportunistic networks have attracted attention due to their inherent characteristics, such as long latency, low data rate, and intermittent connectivity. Extensive research has been conducted on opportunistic networks, including the architecture, and routing. However, few in the literature report the performance of TCP in opportunistic networks, especially in the case of Epidemic Routing. This document investigates the performance of TCP [1] in opportunistic networks with Epidemic Routing. Our results show that the Epidemic Routing in opportunistic networks degrades the performance of TCP because multicopy data packets cause duplicate ACKs, and in turn reduce the transmission rate of TCP. An enhanced congestion control for TCP, named A-TCP/Reno is proposed. A-TCP/Reno avoids the duplicate ACK problem caused by Epidemic Routing.</t>
