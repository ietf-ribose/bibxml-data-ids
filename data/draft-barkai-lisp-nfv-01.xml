      <t>This draft describes an RFC 6830 Locator ID Separation Protocol (LISP) based distributed flow-mapping-fabric for dynamic scaling of virtualized network functions (NFV). Network functions such as subscriber-management, content-optimization, security and quality of service, are typically delivered using proprietary hardware appliances embedded into the network as turn-key service-nodes or service-blades within routers. Next generation network functions are being implemented as pure software instances running on standard servers - unbundled virtualized components of capacity and functionality. LISP-SDN based flow-mapping, dynamically assembles these components to whole solutions by steering the right traffic in the right sequence to the right virtual function instance.</t>
