      <t>Due to their critical role in a network, the protection of routingequipements is crucial, particularly against subversion attacks. Forthis purpose, we integrate a trusted plane in the network equipmentsrelated to the routing protocols (e.g. OSPF, BGP, RIP). Thistrusted plane is realized by a trusted element embedded or connectedto the network equipment.</t>
