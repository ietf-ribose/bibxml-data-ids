      <t>Due to their critical role in a network, the protection of routing equipements is crucial, particularly against subversion attacks. For this purpose, we integrate a trusted plane in the network equipments related to the routing protocols (e.g. OSPF, BGP, RIP). This trusted plane is realized by a trusted element embedded or connected to the network equipment.</t>
