      <t>This document extends the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol(LDAP) to support server side current time matching.Matching of time-stamp attribute values against an LDAP server'scurrent time offers advantages for example in case third partyproducts' LDAP client configuration directives (e.g. LDAP filterstatements) do not offer support to dynamically rewrite/replace afilter's assertion value for each request. Using the matching rulesdefined in this document the client is able to provide a constantmatching rule assertion value to trigger the server side comparisonof the given/stored 'Generalized Time' syntax based attribute valueagainst the LDAP server's current time.Therefore this document specifies four matching rules and twodedicated assertion syntaxes to be used in conjuntion with the wellknown 'Generalized Time' syntax based attribute values.</t>
