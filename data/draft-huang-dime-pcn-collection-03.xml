      <t>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a technique for maintaining QoS for inelastic flows in a DIFFServ domain. The PCN architecture requires that egress nodes send regular reports of PCN-defined measurements to a decision point. It requires further that the decision point occasionally be able to request certain measurements from ingress nodes. The decision point can be located in different places in the network. This memo defines a Diameter application to support communications between the ingress and egress nodes and a Diameter server acting as a PCN decision point.</t>
