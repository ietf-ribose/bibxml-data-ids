      <t>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a technique for maintaining QoSfor inelastic flows in a DIFFServ domain. The PCN architecturerequires that egress nodes send regular reports of PCN-definedmeasurements to a decision point. It requires further that thedecision point occasionally be able to request certain measurementsfrom ingress nodes. The decision point can be located in differentplaces in the network. This memo defines a Diameter application tosupport communications between the ingress and egress nodes and aDiameter server acting as a PCN decision point.</t>
