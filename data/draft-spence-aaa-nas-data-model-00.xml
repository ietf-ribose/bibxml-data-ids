      <t>Recently, considerable attention has been given to the need to betterstructure the information carried in protocols operating within thenetwork access environment. The arguable benefits of structuredinformation is consistency in the definitions and reuse of individualdata elements and well defined means for extending existingstructures to support new or proprietary features and capabilities.In an effort to demonstrate the benefits of organizing data elementsand provide a practical means for deploying such a model, this memotakes the existing attributes currently used in RADIUS and maps theminto a data model. To demonstrate the deployment of the data modelwithin the network access environment, the data model has beenrepresented as a PIB. While the data model could be implemented torun over protocols other than COPS, SPPI is currently the onlylanguage available which expresses data modeling concepts withsufficient detail to demonstrate the benefits in a practical manner.</t>
