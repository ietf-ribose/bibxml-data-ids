      <t>This memo shows that an AF PHB class, as defined in RFC 2597, is capable of supporting explicit per flow admission control. Admission control is obtained by a suitable use of two out of the three drop precedence levels. Level 1 is dedicated to conforming accepted traffic, i.e. traffic that has passed admission control test and conforms to edge-policing functions. Level 2 is used as an implicit signaling pipe and acts as the core network support for the admission control procedure.</t>
