      <t>This memo shows that an AF PHB class, as defined in RFC 2597, iscapable of supporting explicit per flow admission control. Admissioncontrol is obtained by a suitable use of two out of the three dropprecedence levels. Level 1 is dedicated to conforming acceptedtraffic, i.e. traffic that has passed admission control test andconforms to edge-policing functions. Level 2 is used as an implicitsignaling pipe and acts as the core network support for theadmission control procedure.</t>
