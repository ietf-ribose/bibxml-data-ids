      <t>Billing information protocol is a simple protocol that can be used by servers to indicate the charging information incurred due to a specific operation with a client. In many situations a client, like a SIP user agent may need to know the charging information about a specific interaction with the server. This document defines the BIP (Billing Information Protocol) that can be used as a standard way to share this charging information. BIP supports simple indication of charging information. The protocol defines a generic representation on the number of units charged, the charge incurred per unit etc. This will be useful for implementing services like advice of charge. The protocol is targeted for VoIP usages, however any generic client-server interaction can use this protocol.</t>
