      <t>Footprint advertisement is a very important step for CDN interconnection and generates a lot of discussion. Actually, each CDN can serve the whole world if its surrogates are publicly reachable by IP addresses. But if a CDN does that, it can not satisfy the requirements from the applications. So CDNs deliver contents for applications, and the basic requirements should be from the applications. One CDN can serve different applications well with different footprint. But there is rare discussion on service level requirements based footprint. This document is used to generate the discussion on this aspect.</t>
