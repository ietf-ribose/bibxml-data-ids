      <t>The performance measurements of service flow are becoming significant important for administrators monitoring the fitness of the network. This memo defines an end-to-end flow-based performance measurement method, which is achieved by generating synthetic measurement packets, injecting them to the network and analyzing the statistics carried in the measurement packets.This measurement method can measure flow characteristics such as delay, ipdv (IP Packet Delay Variation) and packet loss.</t>
