      <t>This document describes the overall concept of a distributed indexing system based on the Common Indexing Protocol (CIP) [1], as it will be implemented in the EC co-funded DESIRE II project and afterwards maintained as a service by the European academia. Although the system is designed for multi-purpose usage, the main focus of this document lies on its application as a LDAPv3 [2] Directory white pages index, although the system is designed to be applicable to other indexing problems as well.</t>
