      <t>In this document, we provide a survey of P2P (Peer-to-Peer) systems. The survey includes a definition and several taxonomies of P2P systems. This survey also includes a description of which types of applications can be built with P2P technologies and examples of P2P applications that are currently in use on the Internet. Finally, we discuss architectural trade-offs and provide guidelines for deciding whether or not a P2P architecture would be suitable to meet the requirements of a given application. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>
