    <abstract>
      <t>Segment Routing is a source routing paradigm that explicitly indicates the forwarding path for packets at the ingress node. An SR Policy is a set of candidate paths, each consisting of one or more segment lists. In the scenario where there are multiple segment list paths, traffic load balancing can be achieved based on the weight value assigned to each path. Typically, the weight value for each path is fixed. This document defines an extension of BGP SR Policy for setting the weight value for each path based on time range.</t>
