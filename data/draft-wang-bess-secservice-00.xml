    <abstract>
      <t>For certain users, security is of paramount importance. Even when building their own backbone networks, these users require end-to-end service encryption to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of their data. In such scenarios, IPsec can be used to provide flexible and robust encryption capabilities, while SRv6 can be used to guide the forwarding of data packets along different paths on the network. By combining these technologies, users can create a highly secure and efficient network environment that meets their specific needs and requirements.</t>
