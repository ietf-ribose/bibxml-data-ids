    <abstract>
      <t>This document first analyzes the critical issues of bottlenecks in existing tunneling and translation technologies, which can be solved by proper load balancing mechanisms(e,g., scalability, availability, and single point of failure). Then, several key factors in designing a valid load balancing mechanism are described. Solutions to specific load balancing requirements can be drawn out by considering these factors. At last, current efforts about load balancing are introduced.</t>
