      <t>TCP congestion control has been developed on the assumption that congestion in the network to be the only cause for packet loss. Thus, it drops its transmit window upon detecting a packet loss. In the presence of high erro rates and intermittent connective characteristic of wireless link, these results in an unnecessary reduction in link bandwidth utilization for packet losses are not mainly due to congestion.</t>
