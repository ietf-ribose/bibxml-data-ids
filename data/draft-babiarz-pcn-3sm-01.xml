      <t>This document proposes a mechanism for admission control and flowtermination. It is based on the concept of pre-congestionnotification (PCN) using three different codepoints: "no pre-congestion", "admission-stop", and "excess-traffic" for packetmarking. Therefore, the proposal is called three state marking(3sm). The behaviour of edge nodes is presented which distinguishesfrom other proposals through little complexity and its ability tocope with multipath routing. Algorithms required for packet meteringand marking are explained in detail.</t>
