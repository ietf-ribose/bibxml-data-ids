      <t>The aim of this document is to define a small set of metrics that arerobust, easy to understand, orthogonal, relevant, and easy tocompute. The IPPM WG has defined a large number of richlyparameterized metrics because network measurement has many purposes.Often, the ultimate purpose is to report a concise set of metricsdescribing a network's current state to an end user. It is for thispurpose that the present set of metrics is defined, and the documentis principally concerned with "short-term" reporting considerations(a few seconds or minutes as opposed to days, months or years.)</t>
