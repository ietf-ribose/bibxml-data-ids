      <t>This document describes the core security features of the NFSv4 family of protocols, applying to all minor versions. The discussion includes the use of security features provided by RPC on a per- connection basis. Important aspects of the authorization model, related to the ACL feature, will be specified in a separate document. The current version of the document is intended, in large part, to result in working group discussion regarding existing NFSv4 security issues and to provide a framework for addressing these issues and obtaining working group consensus regarding necessary changes. When the resulting documents (i.e. this document and one derived from the separate ACL specification) are eventually published as RFCs, they will, by updating these documents, supersede the description of security appearing in existing minor version specification documents such as RFC 7530 and RFC 8881,</t>
