    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a task-oriented, agent-based method for fault recovery in converged public-private mobile networks. The proposed method introduces a multi-agent collaboration framework that enables autonomous failure detection, scoped diagnosis, inter-domain coordination, and intent-driven policy reconfiguration. It is particularly applicable in complex 5G/6G network deployments, such as Multi-Operator Core Networks (MOCN) and Standalone Non-Public Networks (SNPN), where traditional centralized management is insufficient for ensuring high service reliability and dynamic recovery. The document also specifies protocol requirements for inter-agent communication, state consistency, and secure coordination, aiming to support interoperability and resilience across heterogeneous network domains.</t>
