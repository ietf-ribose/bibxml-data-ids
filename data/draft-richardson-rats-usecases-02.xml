      <t>This document details mechanisms created for performing Remote Attestation that have been used in a number of industries. The document intially focuses on existing industry verticals, mapping terminology used in those specifications to the more abstract terminology used by RATS. The document aspires to describe possible future use cases that would be enabled by common formats.</t>
