    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes procedures to support node protection for (unicast) Label Switched Paths(LSPs) established by LDP("Label Distribution Protocol"). In order to protect a node N, the Point of Local Repair (PLR) of N must discover the Merge Points(MPTs) of node N such that traffic can be redirected to them in case node N fails. Redirecting the traffic around the failed node N depends on existing point-to-point LSPs originated from the PLR to the MPTs while bypassing the protected node N. The procedures described in this document are topology independent in a sense that they provide node protection in any topology.</t>
