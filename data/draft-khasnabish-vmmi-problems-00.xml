      <t>In this draft, we discuss the issues and requirements related to migration, mobility, and interconnection of Virtual Machines (VMs)and Virtual Network Elements (VNEs). We also describe the limitations of various types of virtual local area networking (VLAN) and virtual private networking (VPN) techniques that are traditionally expected to support such migration, mobility, and interconnection.</t>
