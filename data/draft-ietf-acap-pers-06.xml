      <t>It has become common for Internet mail users to receive and compose mail in the capacity of different roles or identities (for example, personal and work), to receive and compose mail at different machines, and to use multiple programs which require mail composition configuration information. These different roles or identities have become known as email personalities. The Application Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP] provides an ideal mechanism for storage of email personality data. This specification defines a standard ACAP dataset class for email personalities, and a common option for indicating a default. An SMTP URL scheme is also defined.</t>
