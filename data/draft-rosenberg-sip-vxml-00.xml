      <t>VoiceXML is an XML based scripting language for describing voice dialogs. VoiceXML interpreters run within an interpreter context that, among other tasks, provides a call control interface for accessing the interpreter. It is very natural to provide a VoIP-based interpreter context that uses SIP and RTP to communicate with the outside world. In this document, we provide detailed specifications for a SIP/RTP based interpreter context.</t>
