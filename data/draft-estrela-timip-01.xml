      <t>All IP mobility protocols currently proposed on the IETF assume that the mobile nodes always have a mobility-aware IP stack, which is still a scenario that can seldom be found nowadays. Most terminals, including the laptops and PDAs which most would benefit of the mobility support, still use legacy IP stacks, limiting their use to layer-2 mobility within a single IP subnet. This document presents Terminal Independent Mobile IP (TIMIP), which supports IP micro-mobility of all possible existing legacy IP terminals, while fully interoperating with Mobile IP to provide macromobility across IP subnets for all terminals.</t>
