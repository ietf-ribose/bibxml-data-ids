      <t>The Dynamic MANET On-demand (AODVv2) routing protocol is intended for use by mobile routers in wireless, multihop networks. AODVv2 determines unicast routes among AODVv2 routers within the network in an on-demand fashion, offering on-demand convergence in dynamic topologies. This document specifies a simple modification to AODVv2 (and possibly other reactive routing protocols) enabling faster notifications to known sources of traffic upon determination that a route for such traffic's destination has become invalid.</t>
