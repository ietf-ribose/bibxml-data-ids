      <t>Distributed calendaring is gradually becoming more demanding than standalone calendaring and scheduling. The use of calendaring and scheduling has grown exponentially and enterprise and inter- enterprise business has become so dependent on group scheudling applications. But there is no Internet standard to provide interoperability among various calendaring applications. Consequently, user need to install different conduit programs to access these calendaring stores. This memo proposes a HTTP based simple calendaring access protocol which allows web, email and any HTTP compliant clients to access and manipulate calendar store. The motivation for this proposal is the expanded scope and diversity of the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web provides a simple and effective means for users to search, browse, retrieve, and publish information of their own available for others. Now that Web browsers and servers are ubiquitous on the Internet, it is worthwhile to use HTTP as transport protocol and XML to encode calendar objects. The power and extensibility of XML allows us to represent calendar data objects as well-formed XML documents. Simple Calendar Access Protocol(SCAP) allows exchanging calendaring information between scheduling systems using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This allows users to schedule meetings with anyone else, no matter what scheduling software they use. This document specifies a set of methods, headers, and content-types ancillary to HTTP/1.1 for the management of calender properties, creation and management of calendar objects, and namespace manipulation.</t>
