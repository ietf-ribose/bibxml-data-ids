      <t>A definition of asset schema and profiles is needed to provide a semantic definition of tokenized assets. The Asset schema is an abstract construct at the root hierarchy of more specific "asset profiles". Asset profiles describe the structure (type) of assets that are specific to a given domain or industry. An asset instance that is instantiated in a specific network and is exchanged via the SATP protocol has an instance-class relationship (in an ontological sense) with a given profile. Asset profiles are essential to the SATP protocol as they define the semantics of asset instances to be transferred. Gateways may negotiate asset transfers based on the nature and abilities of the assets as defined according to their profile. The current document discusses the definition of the asset schema and profile.</t>
