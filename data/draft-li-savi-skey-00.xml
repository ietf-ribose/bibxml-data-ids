      <t>This document describes a mechanism to provide source addressvalidation for IPv6 networks using a shared key (Skey) signatureapproach. The basic idea is that a device generates a signatureusing a shared key and its IP address and then the signature is sentto a validating device for source address validation. The proposedmechanism is intended to complement ingress filtering techniques witha finer granularity on the control of the source addresses used.</t>
