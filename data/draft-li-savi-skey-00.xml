      <t>This document describes a mechanism to provide source address validation for IPv6 networks using a shared key (Skey) signature approach. The basic idea is that a device generates a signature using a shared key and its IP address and then the signature is sent to a validating device for source address validation. The proposed mechanism is intended to complement ingress filtering techniques with a finer granularity on the control of the source addresses used.</t>
