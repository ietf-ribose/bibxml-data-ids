    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an extension to the Proof of Process (PoP) specification for documenting collaborative authorship. The extension enables multiple contributors to independently attest to their individual contributions while maintaining a unified Evidence chain for the combined document. This supports use cases including academic co-authorship, legal document drafting by teams, and creative works with multiple writers.</t>
