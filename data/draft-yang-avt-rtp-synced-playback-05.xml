      <t>When watching the same IPTV channel, different TV sets may not renderthe same picture and the associated audio at the same moment. Thevariation in end-to-end delay that resulted in such asynchronousplayback between users is referred to as inter-user playback delay.Unicast based rapid acquisition of multicast RTP sessions (RAMS) asspecified in [I-D.ietf-avt-rapid-acquisition-for-rtp] is an importanttechnique in achieving fast channel switching in IPTV as well asother multicast applications. In addition, RAMS also significantlyrelaxes the requirement of relatively short random access pointperiod in encoding of video streams in multicast applications, thusallowing significantly improved compression efficiency. However, onthe other hand, the use of RAMS increases inter-user playback delay,which makes users receiving the same multicast session playback thesame content asynchronously. This document specifies a mechanism tohelp reduce inter-user playback delay caused by the use of RAMS.</t>
