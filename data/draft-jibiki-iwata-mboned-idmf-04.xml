      <t>This draft proposes a new inter-domain multicast forwarding (IDMF) mechanism for PIM-SM multicast routing protocol. Although there have been various inter-domain multicast routing and forwarding protocols, they still have a limitation for handling policy routing, QoS routing, accounting and security, which network administrators are willing to use in their network. In order to solve this limitation, we propose a novel approach to create an inter-domain multicast forwarding tree (or routing table) among multiple PIM-SM domains with logical unicast paths over which multicast packets are forwarded or flooded. The logical unicast paths are created by either IP-in-IP tunneling method , IP masquerade-like method, and MPLS label switched path (LSP) method, which can easily reuse policy routing and QoS routing for unicast routing. These logical unicast paths are established among IDMF capable nodes or proxies, which are located within each PIM-SM domain, either manually or by a dynamic IDMP tree construction protocol. The IDMP capable nodes can also behave a proxy sender of multicast packets. It can prevent a multicast receiver from changing a RP-tree into a global SP-tree, and also can help to reduce virtually the number of multicast sources for a particular multicast group. This property can be effectively used for accounting, security and scalability enhancement required for interdomain communication. The proposed mechanism is a general framework for inter-domain multicast forwarding and can be also used as a MSDP based forwarding mechanism.</t>
