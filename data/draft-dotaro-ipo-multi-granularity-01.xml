      <t>The multi-granularity concept in optical networks is the ability to simultaneously switch different levels of granularity inside a given optical network. Optical multi-granularity and particularly waveband switching raises some issues for GMPLS. These have been partially addressed in [GMPLS-ARCH] and [GMPLS-SIG] from the CCAMP Working Group. However, enabling multi-granularity in optical networks demands the definition of a more complete set of requirements considering the management, control, routing and signaling issues and their impacts in the GMPLS protocols suite.</t>
