      <t>The multi-granularity concept in optical networks is the ability tosimultaneously switch different levels of granularity inside a givenoptical network. Optical multi-granularity and particularly wavebandswitching raises some issues for GMPLS. These have been partiallyaddressed in [GMPLS-ARCH] and [GMPLS-SIG] from the CCAMP WorkingGroup. However, enabling multi-granularity in optical networksdemands the definition of a more complete set of requirementsconsidering the management, control, routing and signaling issuesand their impacts in the GMPLS protocols suite.</t>
