    <abstract>
      <t>Network slicing can be used to meet the connectivity and performance requirement of different services or customers in a shared network. An IETF network slice can be realized as enhanced VPNs (VPN+), which is delivered by integrating the overlay VPN service with a Virtual Transport Network (VTN) as the underlay. An end-to-end IETF network slice may span multiple network domains. Within each domain, traffic of the end-to-end network slice service is mapped to a domain VTN. In the context of IETF network slicing, a VTN can be instantiated as a Network Resource Partition (NRP). When segment routing (SR) is used to build a multi-domain IETF network slices, information of the local network slices in each domain can be specified using special SR binding segments called VTN binding segments (VTN BSID). The multi-domain IETF network slice can be specified using a list of VTN BSIDs in the packet, each of which can be used by the corresponding domain edge nodes to steer the traffic of end-to-end IETF network slice into the specific VTN in the local domain. This document describes the functionality of VTN binding segment and its instantiation in SR-MPLS and SRv6.</t>
