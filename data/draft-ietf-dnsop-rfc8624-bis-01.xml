      <t>&lt;EDITOR NOTE: This document does not change the status (MUST, MAY, RECOMMENDED, etc) of any of the algorithms listed in [RFC8624]; that is the work of future documents. Instead, this document moves the canonical list of algorithms from [RFC8624] to an IANA registry. This is done for two reasons: 1) to allow the list to be updated more easily, and, much more importantly, 2) to allow the list to be more easily referenced.&gt; The DNSSEC protocol makes use of various cryptographic algorithms to provide authentication of DNS data and proof of non-existence. To ensure interoperability between DNS resolvers and DNS authoritative servers, it is necessary to specify both a set of algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidelines to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations support. This document updates [RFC8624] by moving the canonical source of algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance for DNSSEC from [RFC8624] to an IANA registry. Future extensions to this registry can be made under new, incremental update RFCs.</t>
