      <t>This document defines an extension to LoST (RFC5222) that allows a planned change to the data in the LoST server to occur. Records that previously were valid will become invalid at a date in the future, and new locations will become valid after the date. The extension adds two elements to the &lt;findservice&gt; request: A URI to be used to inform the LIS that previously valid locations will be invalid after the planned change date, and add a date which requests the server to perform validation as of the date specified. It also adds an optional Time-To-Live element to the response, which informs clients about the current expected lifetime of the validation. This document also provides a conventional XML schema for LoST, as backwards compatible alternative to the RelaxNG schema in RFC5222</t>
