    <abstract>
      <t>The IETF is an international group that conducts most of its business using electronic mail however three times a year it conducts an open meeting for one week. For the most part the actual mechanics of the meeting are organised by the IETF secretariat but there are some requirements placed on the organisation hosting the meeting. This document attempts to provide some guidelines for organisations that wish to volunteer to act as host for one of these open meetings. As the IETF growth pattern mirrors the Internet itself this document expresses sizes as a percentage of the expected attendance rather than use fixed numbers as we expect these numbers to change for each meeting. At the last meeting, in Washington DC there were just over 1900 attendees.</t>
