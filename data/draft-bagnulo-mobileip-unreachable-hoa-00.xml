      <t>This note proposes a modification to the MIPv6 specification in order to allow the preservation of established communications when the path between the MN and the CN through the HoA becomes unavailable. The proposed modification essentially consists on allowing the extension of BCE lifetime upon the reception of ICMP Destination Unreachable message as reply to a Binding Refresh Request (BRR) message.</t>
