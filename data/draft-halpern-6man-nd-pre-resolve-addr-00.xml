    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes a new optional event to trigger address resolution using IPv6 Neighbor Discovery. This helps optimize router performance, and can help mitigate certain potential ND-related denial-of-service attacks. Upon receiving a DAD-NS message, the neighbor solicitation message used to detect duplicate addresses, if the target address encoded in the DAD-NS is not a duplicate address, the receiving device responds by triggering address resolution for the target address in the DAD-NS, in preparation for expectant future communication with the sending device.</t>
