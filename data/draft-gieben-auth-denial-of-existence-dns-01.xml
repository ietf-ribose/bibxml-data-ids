    <abstract>
      <t>Authenticated denial of existence allows a resolver to validate that a certain domain name does not exist. It is also used to signal that a domain name exists, but does not have the specific RR type you were asking for. When returning a negative DNSSEC response, a name server usually includes up to two NSEC records. With NSEC3 this amount is three. This document provides extra documentation and context on the mechanisms behind NSEC and NSEC3</t>
