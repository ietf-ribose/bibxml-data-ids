    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies an extension to the Distributed Denial-of- Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) signal channel protocol so that DOTS clients can control their filtering rules when an attack mitigation is active. Particularly, this extension allows a DOTS client to activate or de- activate existing filtering rules during a DDoS attack. The characterization of these filtering rules is supposed to be conveyed by a DOTS client during an idle time by means of the DOTS data channel protocol.Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor) Please update these statements within the document with the RFC number to be assigned to this document: o "This version of this YANG module is part of RFC XXXX;" o "RFC XXXX: Controlling Filtering Rules Using Distributed Denial- of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Signal Channel"; o reference: RFC XXXX o [RFCXXXX] Please update the "revision" date of the YANG module.</t>
