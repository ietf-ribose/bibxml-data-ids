      <t>We propose a user scenario framework of location-based services to analyze security and privacy issues associated with the services. The framework is intended to cover the most of the location-based services available today and in near future. There are many kinds of existing and possible location-based services. Though, what is meant by location- based service varies widely. The framework gives people a common ground from where discussion on the security and privacy issues can start.</t>
