      <t>Model driven service and network management provides a programmatic and standards-based way of representing virtual services or networks and configuration to the network device that are used to construct the service. It can be used at various phases of service and network management life cycle such as service instantiation, service provision, optimization, monitoring, and diagnostic. Also, it can be designed to automate network management and provide closed-loop control for the sake of agile service creation, delivery and maintenance. This document provides a framework that describes and discusses an architecture for service and network management automation with YANG Modeling technologies. An applicability of YANG data model to automation of virtualized network service is also investigated.</t>
