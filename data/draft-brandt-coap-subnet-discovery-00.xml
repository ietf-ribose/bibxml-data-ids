      <t>The document describes the process of discovering CoAP serversdistributed in multiple subnets in a non-specified topology. CoAPDiscovery Gateways are used to discover one subnet from another.CoAP Discovery Gateways may provide caching to enable discovery ofsleeping nodes in LLN environments. The solution scales to largeinstallations since discovery is handled by the client in anincremental fashion.</t>
