    <abstract>
      <t>Flowspec, an extension to BGP, enables the dissemination of traffic flow specification rules and can be used to steer traffic into SR Policy. However, existing approaches using Flowspec to direct traffic into a SR Policy have certain drawbacks (for details, refer to section 1). This document difines two new standard actions for the BGP Flowspec V2 protocol (FSv2) [I-D.ietf-idr-flowspec-v2]: Redirect to SR Policy Action and SRv6 SID Action. The former allows traffic to be directed to a designated SR Policy, while the latter enables the encapsulation of an additional SRv6 SID as needed during redirection. These extensions address the shortcomings of existing solutions.</t>
