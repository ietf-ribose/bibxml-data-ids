      <t>This Internet-Draft presents the mechanism and corresponding signalling protocol extensions for provisioned and dynamic lightpath restoration schemes. The mechanisms proposed cover shared meshed restoration as well as provisioned and non-provisioned schemes. The former (equivalent to lightpath protection) implies the provisioning of backup lightpaths in advance before failures occur.</t>
