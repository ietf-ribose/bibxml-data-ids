      <t>This document specifies two approaches by which multimedia data (e.g., MBone conferences), transmitted using the Real-Time Protocol (RTP), may be recorded to Advanced Streaming Format (ASF) files. The first method requires a minimum amount of buffering at the recording station but results in recordings which identically preserve the received content including out of order packets, network ''jitter'', etc. The second approach requires buffering at the recording station but results in enhanced recordings (i.e., higher percentage of correctly ordered packets, elimination of a percentage of received jitter, potential recovery of a percentage of lost packets). Both approaches record all received RTP content and the relevant subset of RTCP information. This recording occurs transparently to the MBone conference or RTP session, and does not involve any alterations to normal RTP, RTCP, or ASF use.</t>
