      <t>This document specifies two approaches by which multimedia data (e.g.,MBone conferences), transmitted using the Real-Time Protocol (RTP), maybe recorded to Advanced Streaming Format (ASF) files. The first methodrequires a minimum amount of buffering at the recording station butresults in recordings which identically preserve the received contentincluding out of order packets, network ''jitter'', etc. The secondapproach requires buffering at the recording station but results inenhanced recordings (i.e., higher percentage of correctly orderedpackets, elimination of a percentage of received jitter, potentialrecovery of a percentage of lost packets). Both approaches record allreceived RTP content and the relevant subset of RTCP information. Thisrecording occurs transparently to the MBone conference or RTP session,and does not involve any alterations to normal RTP, RTCP, or ASF use.</t>
