    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the operations performed by a forward-proxy or reverse-proxy, when using the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) in group communication scenarios. Such CoAP proxy processes a single request, sent by a CoAP client over unicast, and distributes the request over IP multicast to a group of CoAP servers. It then collects the individual responses from these CoAP servers and sends these responses to the CoAP client, in a way that allows the client to distinguish the responses and their origin servers through addressing information. This document updates RFC7252.</t>
