The generic, line, trunk, handset, RTP, DTMF (Dual Tone Multifrequency), announcement server and script packages are updates of packages from RFC 2705 with additional explanation and in some cases new versions of these packages. In addition to these, five new packages are defined here. These are the signal list, resource reservation, media format, supplementary services and digit map extension packages.</t>
