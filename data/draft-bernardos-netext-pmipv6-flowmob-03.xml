      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based localized mobility management protocol that enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam across gateways without changing their IP addresses. PMIPv6 basic specification also provides limited multi- homing support to multi-mode mobile devices. The ability of movement of selected flows from one access technology to another is missing in basic PMIPv6. This document describes enhancements to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol that are required to support flow mobility over multiple physical interfaces.</t>
