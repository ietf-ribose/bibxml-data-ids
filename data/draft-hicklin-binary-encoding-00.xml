      <t>This document suggests a method of encoding generic binary files so that they can be transmitted as MIME attachments between systems that use RFC 1652-compliant message transfer agents (such as Sendmail 8.7 (now in beta)). This encoding method has a size increase of &lt; 2% in the vast majority of cases, whereas base-64 encoding increases file size by ~33%. This encoding method would use a new MIME Content-Transfer-Encoding type: 'binary-to-8bit-encoding'. Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested.</t>
