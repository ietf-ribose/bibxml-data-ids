      <t>This document analyzes the existing issues for IPv6 site renumbering. It also analyzes the possible directions to solve these issues and gives recommendations. This document only takes the perspective of network and network protocols. Renumbering in IPv4 networks, in the dual-stack network or in the IPv4/IPv6 transition networks are out of scope. This document only takes the perspective of network and network protocols. According to the different stages, these issues are described in three categories: considerations during network design, considerations for routine network management, and considerations during renumbering operation. Recommended solutions or strategies are also described. Issues that still remain unsolvable are listed as the fourth category. Although we list a few non-network issues in this document, we consider them as issues that ISPs or network providers cannot affect. So, these issues are considered to be unsolvable and not explore further in these document, though they may be solved by OS implementations or application implementations. We summary the requests that need to extend current protocols as further works at the end of this document.</t>
