      <t>The iCalendar data format is being updated and included in those discussions is the desire to update the time zone information. This is a proposal for time zone updates to iCalendar. The time zone information will be available in XML format. To comment on this document send email to ietf-calendar@imc.org . This document also specifies an IANA registration process for time zones. No attempt is made to specify any specific time zones as that is political information that is out of scope for this document.</t>
