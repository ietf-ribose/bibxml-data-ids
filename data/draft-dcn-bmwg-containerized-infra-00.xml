    <abstract>
      <t>This draft describes benchmarking considerations for a containerized infrastructure. In a containerized infrastructure, Virtualized Network Functions(VNFs) are deployed on operating-system-level virtualization platform by abstracting the user namespace as opposed to virtualization using a hypervisor. Leveraging this, the system configurations and networking scenarios for VNF benchmarking will be partially changed by way of resource allocation and network port binding between a physical host and VNFs. In this draft we compare the state of the art in container networking architecture with networking on VM-based virtualized systems, and provide several test scenarios for network performance in containerized infrastructure.</t>
