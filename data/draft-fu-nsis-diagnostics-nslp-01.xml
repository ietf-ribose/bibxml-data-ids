      <t>The Next Steps in Signaling protocol suite aims to provide a way to communicate with network intermediaries. As such, it is desirable to offer generic diagnostics function for NSIS users and system administrators to make the functionality provided by the network more transparent (e.g., to identify particular NSLPs, to determine to which degree the network supports NSIS, GIST state or specific NSLP session information along a given path). Instead of suggesting one specific solution we highlight the different design options of some simple, stateless diagnostics functions from a querying node to a responding node. These preliminary thoughts should help the working group to have a more structure discussion in this problem space.</t>
