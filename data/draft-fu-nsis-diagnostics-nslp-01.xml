      <t>The Next Steps in Signaling protocol suite aims to provide a way tocommunicate with network intermediaries. As such, it is desirable tooffer generic diagnostics function for NSIS users and systemadministrators to make the functionality provided by the network moretransparent (e.g., to identify particular NSLPs, to determine towhich degree the network supports NSIS, GIST state or specific NSLPsession information along a given path).Instead of suggesting one specific solution we highlight thedifferent design options of some simple, stateless diagnosticsfunctions from a querying node to a responding node. Thesepreliminary thoughts should help the working group to have a morestructure discussion in this problem space.</t>
