      <t>The current authentication process in XMPP requires the XMPP server for a domain to present a certificate that contains that domain's name. This requirement causes several problems in scenarios where XMPP services have been delegated from one domain to another, especially when one domain provides XMPP services for many domains. This document describes an extension to the XMPP authentication process that allows domains to be securely delegated, simplifying authorization in delegation scenarios.</t>
