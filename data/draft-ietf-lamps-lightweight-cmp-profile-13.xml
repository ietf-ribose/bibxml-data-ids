      <t>This document aims at simple, interoperable, and automated PKI management operations covering typical use cases of industrial and IoT scenarios. This is achieved by profiling the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP), the related Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF), and HTTP-based or CoAP-based transfer in a succinct but sufficiently detailed and self-contained way. To make secure certificate management for simple scenarios and constrained devices as lightweight as possible, only the most crucial types of operations and options are specified as mandatory. More special and complex use cases are supported as well, by features specified as recommended or optional.</t>
