    <abstract>
      <t>This memo describes requirements of compensation control of optical impairments such as chromatic dispersion for dynamic optical paths, as well as automatic discovery of fiber-related impairments over links by collaboration of a pair of adjacent nodes upon installation. It is intended as a supplement to the wavelength switched optical networks (WSON) framework with impairments, because GMPLS-based automatic adjustment of impairment compensation and automatic discovery of link impairments will improve usability of WSON.</t>
