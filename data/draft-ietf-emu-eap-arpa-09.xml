      <t>This document defines the eap.arpa. domain for use only in Network Access Identifiers (NAIs) as a way for Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) peers to signal to EAP servers that they wish to obtain limited, and unauthenticated, network access. EAP peers signal which kind of access is required via certain predefined identifiers which use the Network Access Identifier (NAI) format of RFC 7542. A table of identifiers and meanings is defined, which includes entries for RFC 9140. This document updates RFC5216 and RFC9190 to define an unauthenticated provisioning method. Those specifications suggested that such a method has possible, but they did not define how it would be done. This document also updates RFC9140 to deprecate "eap- noob.arpa", and replace it with "noob@eap.arpa"</t>
