      <t>This document describes a functional model of a gateway between the Public Switched Telephony Network (PSTN) and a SIP-based IP network providing telephony service. In this document, the SIP-based IP network will be referred to as Telephony over IP Service (TIPS). The primary function of the gateway is to handle connections involving one or more PSTN phones (i.e.; PSTN black phones) as if those PSTN phones are SIP clients. The goal of this approach is to ensure that SIP-based TIPS service logic applies to both native Internet- based SIP clients and PSTN phones without modification.</t>
