      <t>A generic Key Management API that can be used not only for IP Security [Atk95a] [Atk95b] [Atk95c] but also for other network security services is presented in this document. This API has been implemented by the author inside 4.4-Lite BSD as part of NRL's freely distributable and usable IPv6 and IPsec implementation. [AMPMC96] It is documented here for the benefit of others who might also adopt and use the API, thus providing increased portability of key management applications (e.g. a Photuris daemon).</t>
