      <t>The Independent Data Unit Protection Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (IDUP-GSS-API) extends the GSS-API [RFC-1508] for applications requiring protection of a generic data unit (such as a file or message) in a way which is independent of the protection of any other data unit and independent of any concurrent contact with designated 'receivers' of the data unit. Thus, it is suitable for applications such as secure electronic mail where data needs to be protected without any on-line connection with the intended recipient(s) of that data. Subsequent to being protected, the independent data unit can be transferred to the recipient(s) - or to an archive - perhaps to be processed only days or years later.</t>
