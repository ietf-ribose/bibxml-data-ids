      <t>This document specifies the Atomic Cryptographic Entity Generative Framework (ACE-GF), a cryptographic construction for deriving and reconstructing stable cryptographic identities from user-held credentials without requiring persistent storage of a master secret. ACE-GF addresses a structural limitation of existing deterministic key-derivation and identity systems, which rely on long-lived root secrets and rigid derivation hierarchies. By separating identity reconstruction from long-term secret storage, ACE-GF enables stateless identity recovery, credential rekeying, and context- isolated derivation across multiple cryptographic algorithms. The framework is designed to be application-agnostic and may be applied to diverse environments such as authentication systems, distributed identities, secure key management, and cryptographic wallets. This document defines the core construction, security properties, and interoperability considerations of ACE-GF, while application-specific profiles are defined separately.</t>
