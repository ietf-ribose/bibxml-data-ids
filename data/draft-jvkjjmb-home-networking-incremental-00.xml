      <t>The home network is an environment subject to ongoing evolution and change. Many home networks today are simplistic in nature, often comprising of a single router/gateway. The expectation over time is predicated on the notion that the home network will be more complex servicing many in-home and Internet functions. The home network will evolve necessitating the replacement and update to current hardware and software to more advanced devices and software capable of operating in more complex environments. This document provides a view on how the home network can progress from today's foundational form, to a more advanced environment, using progressive technological capabilities.</t>
