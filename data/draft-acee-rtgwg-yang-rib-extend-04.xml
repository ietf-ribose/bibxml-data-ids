      <t>The Routing Information Base (RIB) is a list of routes and their corresponding administrative data and operational state. The document [ROUTING-CFG] defines the basic building blocks for RIB, and this model augments it to support multiple next-hops (aka, paths) for each route as well as additional attributes.</t>
