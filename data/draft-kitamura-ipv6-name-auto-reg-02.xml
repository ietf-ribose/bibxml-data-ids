      <t>This document describes a scheme of 'Domain Name Auto-Registration for Plugged-in IPv6 Nodes' mechanism that makes it possible to register both regular and inverse domain name information of plugged- in IPv6 nodes to DNS servers automatically. Since IPv6 addresses are too long to remember and EUI64-based addresses are too complicated to remember, there are strong requirements to use logical names that are easy to remember instead of IPv6 addresses to specify IPv6 nodes and to register domain name information of plugged-in IPv6 nodes automatically. In order to meet the requirements, a mechanism is proposed as one of the IPv6 auto-configuration (plug and play) functions. After the Address Autoconfiguration [ADDR-AUTO] has been executed, it works as a succeeding plug and play mechanism. This document clarifies problems that we meet when we apply the Dynamic Updates in the DNS [DYN-DNS] to automatic domain name information registration mechanisms. This document proposes the Domain Name Auto-Registration mechanism as a solution to these problems.</t>
