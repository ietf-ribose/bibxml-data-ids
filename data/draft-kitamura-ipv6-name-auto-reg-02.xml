      <t>This document describes a scheme of 'Domain Name Auto-Registrationfor Plugged-in IPv6 Nodes' mechanism that makes it possible toregister both regular and inverse domain name information of plugged-in IPv6 nodes to DNS servers automatically.Since IPv6 addresses are too long to remember and EUI64-basedaddresses are too complicated to remember, there are strongrequirements to use logical names that are easy to remember insteadof IPv6 addresses to specify IPv6 nodes and to register domain nameinformation of plugged-in IPv6 nodes automatically.In order to meet the requirements, a mechanism is proposed as one ofthe IPv6 auto-configuration (plug and play) functions. After theAddress Autoconfiguration [ADDR-AUTO] has been executed, it works asa succeeding plug and play mechanism.This document clarifies problems that we meet when we apply theDynamic Updates in the DNS [DYN-DNS] to automatic domain nameinformation registration mechanisms. This document proposes theDomain Name Auto-Registration mechanism as a solution to theseproblems.</t>
