      <t>This document describes the protocol used by a client in a Sametime (TM) community. The protocol enables users connecting to a Sametime community to be aware each other and to send Instant Messages (IMs) to other users in the community. While this protocol does not meet many of the requirements of the IMPP working group, it is provided as background information on existing Instant Messaging and Presence implementations. This protocol is provided 'as is' without warranty of any kind. In particular, commercial use of this protocol requires licensing. The protocol described in this document should enable implementing a client program that can interoperate with Sametime communities, given the user has registered with the community.</t>
