    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes an extension to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery to exchange Stateful Address Identification and Location between State Maintaining Entities located over a backbone link about attached nodes that are attached to the backbone via a Wireless Link, in order to maintain all the entities up-to-date and maintain reachability as the attached nodes move.</t>
