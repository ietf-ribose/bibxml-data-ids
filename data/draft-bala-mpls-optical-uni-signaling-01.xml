      <t>This draft considers the optical network service model referredto as the 'domain services' model [1]. Under this model, the opticalnetwork provides a set of well-defined services to clients (IP andothers). The signaling and routing interface between the client andoptical networks is referred to as the User-Network Interface (UNI).This draft describes the services provided over the UNI, and therequirements on any signaling protocol used to invoke the services.This draft reflects ongoing work at the Optical Interworking Forum(OIF) and the Optical Domain Service Interconnect (ODSI) coalitionon the optical UNI [2]. The relevance of this draft to the IETF istwo-fold. First, for the signaling portion of the optical UNI,extensions of two MPLS signaling protocols are presently underconsideration in the OIF: RSVP with TE extensions and LDP. Theobjective of this draft is to guide the adaptation of theseprotocols for UNI signaling. Second, to harmonize the signaling ofUNI originated lightpath requests and peer model lightpathestablishment mechanisms [1], alignment between OIF, ODSI and IETFlightpath parameters and signaling functionality is desirable. Thisdraft aims to serve this purpose. The content of this draft isexpected to evolve as work progresses on the optical UNI.</t>
