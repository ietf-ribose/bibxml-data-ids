      <t>This document proposes an extension of the Quality of Service (QoS)architecture to support differentiated resilience requirements of IPservices.Several architectures offering Quality of Service in IP-basednetworks are defined by the IETF community. The two most importantof them are the Integrated Services (IntServ) model with theResource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) as the recommended signalingprotocol and the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) model. Recently,Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) emerged introducing extendedtraffic engineering methods into IP and therefore also may supportQoS.Due to the growing commercial importance of the Internet and thetransport of mission-critical services, survivability became a mainservice requirement in addition to the traditional QoS.</t>
