      <t>This document proposes an extension of the Quality of Service (QoS) architecture to support differentiated resilience requirements of IP services. Several architectures offering Quality of Service in IP-based networks are defined by the IETF community. The two most important of them are the Integrated Services (IntServ) model with the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) as the recommended signaling protocol and the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) model. Recently, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) emerged introducing extended traffic engineering methods into IP and therefore also may support QoS. Due to the growing commercial importance of the Internet and the transport of mission-critical services, survivability became a main service requirement in addition to the traditional QoS.</t>
