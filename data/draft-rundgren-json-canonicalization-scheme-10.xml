      <t>Cryptographic operations like hashing and signing requires that the data is expressed in an invariant format. One way to address this is to create a canonical representation of the data. Canonicalization also permits data to be exchanged in its original form on the "wire" while secure cryptographic operations are performed on its canonicalized counterpart in the producer and consumer end points. The JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS) defines how to create a canonical representation of JSON data by building on the strict serialization methods for JSON primitives defined by ECMAScript, constraining JSON data to the I-JSON subset, and by using deterministic property sorting.</t>
