      <t>This document describes new E6 addressing scheme for the creation ofworld-wide networks totally constructed on the base of Ethernettechnology. Hierarchic E6 addresses with the length of 6 octets areused instead of both Ethernet MAC-addresses and IP-addresses whichallows the routing within world-wide networks and cuts overhead ofTCP, IP headers; the address space is extended in 16K times regardingIP addresses. Standard Ethernet LLC2 facilities are employed forguaranteed delivery of information. E6 Network Architecturesimplifies packets processing aglorithms that improves the networkperformance and QoS.</t>
