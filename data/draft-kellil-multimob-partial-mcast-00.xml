    <abstract>
      <t>Various approaches have been proposed to support multicast in PMIPv6 domains. However, the problem of partial deployment of multicast in the PMIPv6 domain has not been considered. In particular, the proposed approaches typically assume that all the MAGs of the PMIPv6 domain are multicast-capable. The present work aims at carrying out the case where some of the PMIPv6 domain's MAGs are not necessarily multicast-capable.</t>
