      <t>This memo documents a consequence of how the TTL re-writingmechanism works (or rather does not work) for the case of aresolver chasing a referral chain several layers deep.The most common example of this is the case of a recursive resolvertrying to look up a third level domain name starting from the root.A result of how this works is that it seems to be a good idea torecommend an increase of the present standard TTL for delegationsfrom the root zone from the present 48 hours to somethingsignificantly longer. But, more importantly, the choice of TTL forthe referral from the parent should be a decision made by thechild, not the parent.</t>
