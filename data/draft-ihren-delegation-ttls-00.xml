      <t>This memo documents a consequence of how the TTL re-writing mechanism works (or rather does not work) for the case of a resolver chasing a referral chain several layers deep. The most common example of this is the case of a recursive resolver trying to look up a third level domain name starting from the root. A result of how this works is that it seems to be a good idea to recommend an increase of the present standard TTL for delegations from the root zone from the present 48 hours to something significantly longer. But, more importantly, the choice of TTL for the referral from the parent should be a decision made by the child, not the parent.</t>
