    <abstract>
      <t>HTTP Alternative Services (Alt-Svc) describes how one origin's resource can be accessed via a different protocol/host/port combination. Alternatives are advertised by servers using the Alt- Svc header field or the ALTSVC frame. This includes a protocol name, which reuses Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) codepoints. The "h3" codepoint indicates the availability of HTTP/3. A client that uses such an alternative first makes a QUIC connection. However, without a priori knowledge of which QUIC version to use, clients might incur a round-trip latency penalty to complete QUIC version negotiation, or forfeit desirable properties of a QUIC version. This document specifies a new Alt-Svc parameter that specifies alternative supported QUIC versions, which substantially reduces the chance of this penalty. Similarly, clients can retrieve additional instructions about access to services or resources via DNS SVCB and HTTP Resource Records. This document also defines a new SvcParamKey for these Resource Records, which specifies the specific QUIC versions in use.</t>
