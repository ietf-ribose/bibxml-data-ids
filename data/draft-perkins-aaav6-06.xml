      <t>IPv6 nodes (clients) need a way to offer credentials to the AAA infrastructure in order to be granted access to the local network. For IPv6, it will be more efficient and thus reasonable to expect such access controls to be exerted by IPv6 routers, possibly as part of performing their role as DHCPv6 relays. Routers and DHCPv6 servers are expected to work in conjunction with AAA servers to determine whether or not the client's credentials are valid. Routers can exert such network access control by the device of carefully controlling entries in their packet filter and Neighbor Cache.</t>
