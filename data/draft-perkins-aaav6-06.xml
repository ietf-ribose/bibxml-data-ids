      <t>IPv6 nodes (clients) need a way to offer credentials to the AAAinfrastructure in order to be granted access to the local network.For IPv6, it will be more efficient and thus reasonable to expectsuch access controls to be exerted by IPv6 routers, possibly aspart of performing their role as DHCPv6 relays. Routers and DHCPv6servers are expected to work in conjunction with AAA servers todetermine whether or not the client's credentials are valid. Routerscan exert such network access control by the device of carefullycontrolling entries in their packet filter and Neighbor Cache.</t>
