    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents an integrated framework for automated security management in 5G edge networks using the Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) architecture. The proposed system leverages Intent-Based Networking (IBN) to allow users or administrators to declare high-level security intents, which are translated into enforceable network and application policies. Network-level policies are delivered to 5G core components via the Network Exposure Function (NEF), while application-level policies are enforced directly on a User Equipment (UE) through distributed IBN Controllers. This architecture supports adaptive, context-aware, and distributed policy enforcement, enabling real-time response to dynamic edge conditions and user mobility scenarios such as handovers. By integrating closed-loop monitoring and analytics, the system ensures consistent and autonomous security across heterogeneous 5G environments.</t>
