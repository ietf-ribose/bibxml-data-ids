    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies SONAR (Statistical Observation Network for Attestation and Reach), a protocol combining three technical constructs to enable verifiable multicast distribution: (1) Physical layer efficiency through native IP multicast transmission achieving O(1) network bandwidth regardless of receiver population, (2) Cryptoeconomic receiver accountability via on-chain stake deposits, Verifiable Random Functions (VRF) for unpredictable sampling, and blockchain-recorded attestation reporting, and (3) Multicast source authentication through ALTA-based asymmetric loss-tolerant packet verification enabling real-time content integrity proofs. SONAR achieves constant 6% bandwidth overhead through separation of content authentication (broadcast to all receivers) from coverage verification (statistical sampling with German Tank Problem estimation). The protocol employs zero-knowledge proof aggregation via zkSNARKs for sample sizes exceeding 1,000 users, providing privacy protection (preventing on-chain correlation attacks), cost efficiency (80-90% reduction), and maintaining O(1) on-chain verification cost while scaling to populations exceeding 10^8 receivers. SONAR enables cryptographically verifiable multicast distribution without trusted intermediaries or per-receiver encryption overhead.</t>
