      <t>This document analyzes scenarios for ENUM and ENUM-like Systems, both for ENUM used by End Users and also for ENUM-like Systems used by operators for network-specific or infrastructure purposes. It also gives some examples of ENUM Usage and proposes a new URI scheme to be used with ENUM. This may allow a way forward for the definition of ENUM Services and also for the definition of the required URIs and their parameters. This document therefore deals with information stored in the ENUM and the look-up process and the usage of the information retived in this look up process. It does not deal with the administrative process related to the population of the relevant zones.</t>
