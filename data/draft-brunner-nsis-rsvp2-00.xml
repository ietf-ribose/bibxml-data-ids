      <t>This memo is a first step towards the design of RSVP Version 2. We take RSVP Version 1 as a basis of this work. RSVP has been criticized mainly because of its complexity and poor scalability among others. We present the first steps towards the definition of a new version of RSVP. The goal is to provide a more 'light' approach that can help improve handling reservations in the network by means of a simplified behavior. This proposal for RSVP Version 2 is not meant as a complete replacement of RSVP Version 1 but is meant to coexist with Version 1. For some scenarios such as receiver orientation and multicasting we assume that RSVP version 1 works fine.</t>
