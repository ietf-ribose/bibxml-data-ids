      <t>This document describes a SIP Call-Info header field usage defined to include Rich Call Data (RCD) associated with the identity of the calling party that can be rendered to a called party for providing more descriptive information about the caller or more details about the reason for the call. This includes extended information about the caller beyond the telephone number such as a calling name, a logo or photo representing the caller or a jCard object representing the calling party. The elements defined for this purpose are intended to be extensible to accommodate related information about calls that helps people decide whether to pick up the phone and with the use of icon and newly defined jCard and other elements to be compatible and complimentary with the STIR/PASSporT Rich Call Data framework.</t>
