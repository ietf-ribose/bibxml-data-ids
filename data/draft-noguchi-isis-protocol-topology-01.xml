      <t>RFC 1195 [1] documents a dual routing protocol that can be used toroute both CLNP and IPv4, that is Integrated IS-IS. [2] addsfunctionality to Integrated IS-IS so that it supports IPv6.RFC 1195 [1] places topological restrictions on networks that arerouted using Integrated IS-IS, specifically, that every router in alevel-1 area must be capable of all network layer protocols that arepresent in that area, and every router in a level-2 area must becapable of all network layer protocols that are present in the wholeIS-IS routing domain.The mechanism described in this document enables a single IS-ISrouting domain to support different network layer protocol topologiesby maintaining separate SPF trees for each network layer protocol.</t>
