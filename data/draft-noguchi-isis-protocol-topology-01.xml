    <abstract>
      <t>RFC 1195 [1] documents a dual routing protocol that can be used to route both CLNP and IPv4, that is Integrated IS-IS. [2] adds functionality to Integrated IS-IS so that it supports IPv6. RFC 1195 [1] places topological restrictions on networks that are routed using Integrated IS-IS, specifically, that every router in a level-1 area must be capable of all network layer protocols that are present in that area, and every router in a level-2 area must be capable of all network layer protocols that are present in the whole IS-IS routing domain. The mechanism described in this document enables a single IS-IS routing domain to support different network layer protocol topologies by maintaining separate SPF trees for each network layer protocol.</t>
