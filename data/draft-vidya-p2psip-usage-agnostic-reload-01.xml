      <t>RELOAD [1] defines an overlay framework for providing peer-to-peerconnectivity and storage/retreival primitives for applications.Applications or usages are expected to reside on top of such anoverlay. In general, this is a good design that allows multipleapplications to use the same overlay framework. In such a design,however, there are some decisions to be made in terms of what is anoverlay function and what must be defined by a usage. Thesedecisions should generally be based on whether the particularfunction is expecting an operation or guarantee from the overlaynodes in general or from a particular usage only. This type ofseparation is especially crucial to avoid needing flag days forupgrading nodes in order to accommodate a newer usage version forperforming the overlay operation.</t>
