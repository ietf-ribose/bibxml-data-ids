      <t>Interworking between regions with 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS has been considered in G.709. Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing would be desirable to facilitate the introduction of new ODU0 and ODUflex signals to an existing network without having to upgrade every node in the network. So ODU0/ODUflex can be mapped into ODU1/ODU2/ODU3 and transit across the 2.5G TS region. Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing are also used to support the multi-domain OTN applications based on the tunnel design. If there are a large number of circuits that share the same endpoints (or even part of an overall path), it may be convenient from a management perspective to first multiplex those ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex into ODU2 or ODU3 to minimize the number of connections that need to be made in intermediate nodes. The ODU2/ODU3 effectively creates a tunnel through the ODU4 network that the ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex can use. This document describes the requirement of multi stages multiplexing configuration assocaited with some specific scenarios in G.709 Optical Transport Network.</t>
