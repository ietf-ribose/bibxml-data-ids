      <t>Interworking between regions with 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS has beenconsidered in G.709. Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing wouldbe desirable to facilitate the introduction of new ODU0 and ODUflexsignals to an existing network without having to upgrade every nodein the network. So ODU0/ODUflex can be mapped into ODU1/ODU2/ODU3and transit across the 2.5G TS region.Multi stages multiplexing/demultiplexing are also used to support themulti-domain OTN applications based on the tunnel design. If thereare a large number of circuits that share the same endpoints (or evenpart of an overall path), it may be convenient from a managementperspective to first multiplex those ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex into ODU2or ODU3 to minimize the number of connections that need to be made inintermediate nodes. The ODU2/ODU3 effectively creates a tunnelthrough the ODU4 network that the ODU0, ODU1 and ODUflex can use.This document describes the requirement of multi stages multiplexingconfiguration assocaited with some specific scenarios in G.709Optical Transport Network.</t>
