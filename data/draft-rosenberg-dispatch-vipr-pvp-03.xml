      <t>One of the main challenges in inter-domain federation of SessionInitiation Protocol (SIP) calls is that many domains continue toutilize phone numbers, and not email-style SIP URI. Consequently, amechanism is needed that enables secure mappings from phone numbersto domains. The main technical challenge in doing this securely isto verify that the domain in question truly is the "owner" of thephone number. This specification defines the PSTN ValidationProtocol (PVP), which can be used by a domain to verify thisownership by means of a forward routability check in the PSTN.LegalThis documents and the information contained therein are provided onan "AS IS" basis and THE CONTRIBUTOR, THE ORGANIZATION HE/SHEREPRESENTS OR IS SPONSORED BY (IF ANY), THE INTERNET SOCIETY, THEIETF TRUST AND THE INTERNET ENGINEERING TASK FORCE DISCLAIM ALLWARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANYWARRANTY THAT THE USE OF THE INFORMATION THEREIN WILL NOT INFRINGEANY RIGHTS OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESSFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</t>
