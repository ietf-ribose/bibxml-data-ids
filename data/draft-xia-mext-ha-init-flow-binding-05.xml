      <t>There are scenarios in which home agent initiated flow binding operations towards the mobile node is needed such as revoking a flow binding or moving a flow from one interface to another because of network resource availability. This document defines one new Mobility Header, two messages, several actions and two new sub- options to perform home agent initiated interactions for flow bindings in a mobile node. Home agent initiated flow bindings are supported for both IPv4 and IPv6 enabled mobile nodes.</t>
