    <abstract>
      <t>This document details some best practices for Application Service Providers who allow associations between a global DNS domain name and use case specific references using DNSSEC to provide a globally consistent, cryptographically verifiable association. Such a mechanism is needed when nonce-based domain control validation is not practical, such as use cases where each participant wants to confirm the association independently. As such, no single Application Service Provider exists to provide and validate a nonce to prove domain control that would satisfy other participating Application Service Providers.</t>
