      <t>This draft describes a fast handover mechanism to provide seamlessmulticast services in the wireless/mobile networks based on the FastMobile IPv6 (FMIPv6). When a mobile node (MN) moves from one accessrouter to another, it may encounter data loss. In the tree joiningcase of the existing scheme, there is a problem of buffer overflowduring the packet forwarding from Previous Access Router (PAR) to NewAccess Router (NAR), in which many packet losses may occur due to thebuffer overflow. In order to reduce this buffer overflow and theconcerned packet losses, we propose a new scheme of a fast tree joinfor seamless multicast handover, which allows the NAR to join themulticast tree before the FMIPv6 handover is completed. In theproposed scheme, we consider the two specific cases: 1) the shorttree joining time, in which no packet forwarding will be required andthus NAR can receive the multicast data from an upstream multicastrouter before the FMIPv6 handover is completed, 2) the long treejoining time, in which the packet forwarding will be required andthus NAR will receive the multicast data after the FMIPv6 handover.</t>
