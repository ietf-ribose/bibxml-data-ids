    <abstract>
      <t>Invariant-Closed System Design (ICSD) defines an architectural principle for building systems in which all representable states are valid and compliant by construction. Rather than relying on runtime detection, validation, or remediation of invalid or abusive behaviour, ICSD ensures that invalid states are structurally unrepresentable through constrained state models, invariant-bound transitions, and authority-anchored truth sources. This document introduces the ICSD concept, its core properties, design trade-offs, and applicability to compliance-critical domains such as payroll, taxation, financial reporting, and regulated infrastructure. It is intended for discussion and experimentation in environments requiring high assurance of correctness, auditability, and resistance to abuse.</t>
