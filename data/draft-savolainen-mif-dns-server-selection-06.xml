      <t>A multi-homed node can be connected to multiple networks that mayutilize different DNS namespaces. The node often receives DNS serverconfiguration information from all connected networks. Some of theDNS servers may have information about namespaces other servers donot have. When the multi-homed node needs to utilize DNS, it has tochoose which of the servers to contact to. This document describes apolicy based method for helping on selection of DNS server for bothforward and reverse DNS lookup procedures with help of DNS suffix andIPv6 prefix information received via DHCPv6.</t>
