      <t>This document outlines the issues facing nomadic communications inan IP-based environment. While cellular systems epitomise currentconcepts of mobility, there is an industry need to support similarfunctions in non-cellular environments as well. Unfortunately,solutions defined to-date by the cellular industry tend to beclosely tied to the technology employed over the radio link (e.g.GSM, cdma2000, UMTS, EDGE).To facilitate discussion, this document begins with a high-leveldescription of functional entities comprising an Open IP NetworkInfrastructure. It then defines an abstract model of the access linkused to connect a mobile host to the network. Using these entitiesand model, we then go on to discuss the issues facing nomadiccomputing that could be usefully addressed by an IETF working grouplike CRAPS.</t>
