    <abstract>
      <t>Each year the NomCom process is actually two processes -- finding out anew how to be a NomCom and conduct its business, and then undertaking the work of the NomCom in selecting individuals to undertake the various roles for which the NomCom has responsibility. This applies to both the chair and to the voting volunteer members of the NomCom. The inclusion of the past chair into the NomCom as a non-voting member mitigates this to some extent, but the past chair is constrained as to the level of advice that can be offerred. This acts an impediment to making concrete changes for future incarnations of the Nomcom that would improve the overall Nomcom process. The NomCom process could benefit from greater levels of continuity from year-to-year to reduce the amount of time taken to by the new Nomcom to define its intended mode of operation and allow the operation each incarnation of the Nomcom with a greater level of consistency. This document changes the term of office for NomCom voting volunteers from one to two years. It also changes the term of office for the NomCom Chair from two to three.</t>
