      <t>[PWE3-CONTROL] specifies a 'signaling protocol' which uses extensionsof LDP [RFC 3036] to set up and maintain pseudowires [PWE3-FR, PWE3-ARCH]. Like any protocol which sets up connections, the signalingprotocol provides a method by which each endpoint can identify theother. [L2VPN-FW] describes a number of different ways in which setsof pseudowires may be combined together into 'Provider ProvisionedLayer 2 VPNs' (L2 PPVPNs, or L2VPNs), resulting in a number ofdifferent kinds of L2VPN. Different kinds of L2VPN may havedifferent 'provisioning models', i.e., different models for whatinformation needs to be configured in what entities. Once configured,the provisioning information is distributed by a 'discovery process',and once the information is discovered, the signaling protocol isautomatically invoked to set up the required pseudowires. Thesemantics of the endpoint identifiers which the signaling protocoluses for a particular type of L2VPN are determined by theprovisioning model. This document specifies a number of PPVPNprovisioning models, and specifies the semantic structure of theendpoint identifiers required. It further specifies how the endpointidentifiers are carried in the 'Generalized Identifier FEC' of[PWE3-CONTROL]. It is believed that the specified identifiers canalso be carried within the L2TP signaling protocol, though this iscurrently not specified.</t>
