      <t>The exploration of outer space depends heavily upon communications technology and in many cases, uses IP. IP address allocation has been formally assigned to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs), but there is no formal allocation of address space for networks in outer space. This document describes updates existing address allocation procedures to include address space for outer space.</t>
