      <t>This document proposes a implementation standard for mapping wallets to domain names using the new WALLET RRType, while allowing for TXT record fallback. The goal is to provide a secure and scalable way to associate wallets with domain names, enabling seamless lookup as well as suggesting required authentication mechanism. The proposal relies on DNSSEC or security successors to ensure trust and security. We also will propose a mechanism for mapping a wallet back to a domain name.</t>
