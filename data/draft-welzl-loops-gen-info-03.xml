      <t>LOOPS (Local Optimizations on Path Segments) aims to provide local (not end-to-end but in-network) recovery of lost packets to achieve better data delivery in the presence of losses. [I-D.li-tsvwg-loops-problem-opportunities] provides an overview over the problems and optimization opportunities that LOOPS could address. The present document is a strawman for the set of information that would be interchanged in a LOOPS protocol, without already defining a specific data packet format. The generic information set needs to be mapped to a specific encapsulation protocol to actually run the LOOPS optimizations. The current version of this document contains sketches of bindings to GUE [I-D.ietf-intarea-gue] and Geneve [I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve].</t>
