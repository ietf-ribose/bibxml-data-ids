      <t>Routing protocols are subject to attacks that can harm individual users or the network operations as a whole. The lack of a common set of security requirements has led to the use in existing routing protocol of a variety of different security solutions, which provide various levels of security coverage. The RPSEC working group intends to deliver in a separate document a set of security requirements for consideration of routing protocol designers. The first step in developing the security requirements is to analyze the threats that face routing protocols. This document describes the threats, including threat sources and capabilities, threat actions, and threat consequences as well as a breakdown of routing functions that might be separately attacked.</t>
