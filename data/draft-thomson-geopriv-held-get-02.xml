      <t>This document describes how an HTTP GET request to an HTTP-Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) resource is handled by the server responsible for that resource. This ensures that requests generated by user agents that are unaware of the special status of a URI do not result in unhelpful responses and enables the use of HTTP GET for location configuration and dereference.</t>
