    <abstract>
      <t>6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels (6to4-PMT) provide a framework which can help manage 6to4 [RFC3056] tunnels operating in an anycast [RFC3068] configuration. The 6to4-PMT framework is intended to serve as an option to operators to help improve the experience of 6to4 operation when conditions of the network may provide sub-optimal performance or break normal 6to4 operation. 6to4-PMT provides a stable provider prefix and forwarding environment by utilizing existing 6to4 relays with an added function of IPv6 Prefix Translation. This operation may be particularly important in NAT444 infrastructures where a customer endpoint may be assigned a non- RFC1918 address thus breaking the return path for anycast [RFC3068] based 6to4 operation. The 6to4-PMT model has successfully been used in a production network and has been implemented as open source code and by a major routing vendor.</t>
