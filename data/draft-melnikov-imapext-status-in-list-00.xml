      <t>Many IMAP clients display information about total number of messages/total number of unseen messages in IMAP mailboxes. In order to dothat they are forced to issue a LIST or LSUB command, to list allavailable mailboxes, followed by a STATUS command for each mailboxfound. This document provides an extension to LIST command thatallows the client to request STATUS information for mailboxestogether with other information typically returned by the LISTcommand.NoteA revised version of this draft document will be submitted to the RFCeditor as a Proposed Standard for the Internet Community. Discussionand suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent tomorg@ietf.org.</t>
