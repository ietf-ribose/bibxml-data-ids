    <abstract>
      <t>The Internet is currently being confronted with service demands from a new generation of applications. Supporting these applications effectively and efficiently will require extending the current Internet 'best-effort' service model to one that offers an integrated suite of services. The purpose of this memo is to describe a proposed 'core' service model for an integrated services Internet. In the Appendix we discuss the process by which such a service model could be standardized by the IETF.</t>
