      <t>Data source authentication is an important requirement to provide multicast security. Data source authentication assures that the member claiming to send the data is the actual sender. An imposter member should not be able to claim to be the sender of the data. This document proposes a scheme by which data source authentication can be acheived. The idea is to instead of digitally signing the data packets, a digitally signed recall packet on detection of an imposter transmission. The data packets are sent using symmetric MAC authentication.</t>
