      <t>There is a clear need to provide and deploy interoperable calendaring and scheduling services for the Internet. Current group scheduling and Personal Information Management (PIM) products are being extended for use across the Internet, today, in proprietary ways. This document has been defined to provide the a definition of a MIME message format for openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling information across the Internet. This memo is meant to serve as the basis for registration of such a MIME media type per [RFC1521]. The proposed media type value is 'TEXT/CALENDAR'. This string would label a media type containing calendaring and scheduling information encoded as text characters formatted in a manner outlined below. This MIME media type provides a standard content type for capturing calendar event and todo information. It also can be used to convey free/busy time information. The content type is suitable as a MIME message entity that can be transferred over MIME based email systems or using HTTP. In addition, the content type is useful as an object for interactions between desktop applications using the operating system clipboard, drag/drop or file systems capabilities.</t>
