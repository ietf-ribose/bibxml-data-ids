      <t>This document includes an analysis of multiple interfaces in a hostand a description of scenarios of multiple interfaces with therespect of the relationship between layer 2 connection and layer 3connection. The current TCP/IP mechanism and networking methods aresuitable for single network interface. When a host has multipleinterfaces, the current TCP/IP mechanism and networking methodscannot directly be used for them. A network interface establisheslayer 2 connection to layer 2 entity (e.g., WLAN Access Point) and itdoes not mean providing proper layer 3 connection. So every activenetwork interfaces do not guarantee successful IP layer operations.In this document, we describe some problems for a host which hasmultiple interfaces as an aspect of host's operations and usagescenarios of multiple interfaces in a host.</t>
