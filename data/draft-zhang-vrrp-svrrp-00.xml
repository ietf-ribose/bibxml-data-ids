      <t>Zhang.Expires April 19, 2010 [page 1] Internet-Draft Management Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol October 2009 In this document, we propose a simplified VRRP protocol called the Slave Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (SVRRP).The design objective of SVRRP is to specify an election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual router to one of the SVRRP routers on a LAN, which is exactly as same as that of VRRP. However, SVRRP executions do not exchange signaling packets and need the assistance of VRRP to perform their functionality appropriately. This approach can be used to improve the efficiency of VRRP routers in certain scenarios.
