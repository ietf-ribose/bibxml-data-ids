      <t>The Simple Record Framing Protocol (SRFP) is designed to provide a common, light-weight protocol for sending record-structured data of possibly indeterminate size over a reliable (TCP) connection. It is designed to be a 'nickel's worth of presentation layer' which can be incorporated into a simple library to prevent reinvention of wheels.</t>
