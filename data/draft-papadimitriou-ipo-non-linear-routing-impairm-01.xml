    <abstract>
      <t>Today, in transparent optical networks, the increasing bit-rate (10 Gbit/s and up to 40 Gbit/s in the future), combined with the increasing number of wavelengths (16 and higher up to 320) and a narrowing of the channels spacing, enhance the impact of non-linear effects on optical signal quality.</t>
