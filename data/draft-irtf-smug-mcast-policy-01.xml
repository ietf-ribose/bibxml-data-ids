    <abstract>
      <t>Security is increasingly becoming a concern in applications built on multi-party communication. Centrally, protection of the application content from non-authorized or malicious parties is the fundamental goal of any security policy specification. This draft seeks to illuminate the design space of secure multicast communication policy. The security requirements of existing application policies are intended to be addressable by these policy dimensions. It is from an understanding of policy design space that the mechanisms for policy specification and enforcement can be derived.</t>
