      <t>When requesting and reporting dialog status in SIP, users often want to know the status of a particular telephone instrument, rather than the status of an Address of Record (AOR). The architecture of SIP makes it difficult to obtain the status of a telephone instrument in a way that is convenient for use in common situations, in particular, in an organization's PBX.

This information can be used to obtain the status of individual telephone instruments.</t>
