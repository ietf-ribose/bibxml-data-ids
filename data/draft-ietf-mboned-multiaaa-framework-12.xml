    <abstract>
      <t>IP multicast-based services, such as TV broadcasting or videoconferencing raise the issue of making sure that potential customers are fully entitled to access the corresponding contents. There is indeed a need for service and content providers to identify users (if not authenticate, especially within the context of enforcing electronic payment schemes) and to retrieve statistical information for accounting purposes, as far as content and network usage are concerned. This memo describes the framework for specifying the Authorization, Authentication and Accounting (AAA) capabilities that could be activated within the context of the deployment and the operation of IP multicast-based services. This framework addresses the requirements presented in "Requirements for Accounting, Authentication and Authorization in Well Managed IP Multicasting Services" [I-D.ietf-mboned-maccnt-req]. The memo provides a basic AAA enabled model as well as an extended fully enabled model with resource and admission control coordination.</t>
