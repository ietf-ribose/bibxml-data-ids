      <t>IP multicast-based services, such as TV broadcasting orvideoconferencing raise the issue of making sure that potentialcustomers are fully entitled to access the corresponding contents.There is indeed a need for service and content providers to identifyusers (if not authenticate, especially within the context ofenforcing electronic payment schemes) and to retrieve statisticalinformation for accounting purposes, as far as content and networkusage are concerned. This memo describes the framework forspecifying the Authorization, Authentication and Accounting (AAA)capabilities that could be activated within the context of thedeployment and the operation of IP multicast-based services. Thisframework addresses the requirements presented in "Requirements forAccounting, Authentication and Authorization in Well Managed IPMulticasting Services" [I-D.ietf-mboned-maccnt-req]. The memoprovides a basic AAA enabled model as well as an extended fullyenabled model with resource and admission control coordination.</t>
