    <abstract>
      <t>In this document, a proactive correspondent registration mechanism is proposed for the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) route optimization between the correspondent node (CN) and the mobile access gateway (MAG) on behalf of the mobile node (MN). Two scenarios are considered according to the type of CN. For the proposed mechanism, the proxy home test and the concurrent care-of test are defined newly with parameters specified by information on candidate MAGs. The proposed correspondent registration mechanism is performed before actual handover for candidate MAGs where the MN can attach newly. Therefore, the proposed mechanism can reduce correspondent registration latency, which can reduce handover latency and thus enhance throughput degradation caused by the bidirectional tunneling via the local mobility anchor (LMA).</t>
