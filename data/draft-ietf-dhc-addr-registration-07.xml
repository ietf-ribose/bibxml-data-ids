    <abstract>
      <t>In networks that are centrally managed, self-generated addresses cause some traceability issues due to their decentralized nature. One of the most important issues in this regard is the inability to register such addresses in DNS. This document defines a mechanism to register self-generated and statically configured addresses in DNS through a DHCPv6 server.</t>
