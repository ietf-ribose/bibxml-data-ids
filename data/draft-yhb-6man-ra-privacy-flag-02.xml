      <t>The temporary addresses described by RFC4941 makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other information collectors to track the hosts,and it is necessary to the home networks,but in the enterprise networks, it is not necessary, and some network administrators want to disable the temporary addresses. This document tries to provide a solution to these network administrators,and they can specify whether the prefixes can be used to generate the temporary addresses.</t>
