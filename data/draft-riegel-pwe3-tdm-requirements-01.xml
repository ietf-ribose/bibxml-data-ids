      <t>This document specifies the particular requirements foredge-to-edge-emulation of circuits carrying time division multiplexeddigital signals of the PDH as well as the SONET/SDH hierarchy overpacket-switched networks. It is based on the common architecture forPseudo Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) as defined in [PWE3-ARCH].It makes references to requirements in [PWE3-REQ] where applicableand complements [PWE3-REQ] by defining requirements originating fromspecifics of TDM circuits.</t>
