      <t>Portions of the radio spectrum that are allocated to a licensed, primary use but are unused or unoccupied at specific locations and times are defined as "white space". White space devices can make use of this spectrum; however, they must first determine which spectrum is unused or unoccupied by a primary user at their current location. A white space database can be consulted that holds information about primary users of the spectrum and that returns information about white space. In this document we introduce a Protocol for Access to WhiteSpace database (PAWS) which is for use between a white space device and a white space database. We give a framework for PAWS, a protocol stack that defines the interface between the white space device and the white space database, the parameters of the protocol, an XML schema that can encode the parameters, and example messages. The realization of the database and the calculation of protected contour are not considered in this framework draft.</t>
