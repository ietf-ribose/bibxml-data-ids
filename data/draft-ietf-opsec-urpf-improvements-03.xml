    <abstract>
      <t>This document identifies a need for improvement of the unicast Reverse Path Filtering techniques (uRPF) (see BCP 84) for detection and mitigation of source address spoofing (see BCP 38). The strict uRPF is inflexible about directionality, the loose uRPF is oblivious to directionality, and the current feasible-path uRPF attempts to strike a balance between the two (see BCP 84). However, as shown in this draft, the existing feasible-path uRPF still has shortcomings. This document describes an enhanced feasible-path uRPF technique, which aims to be more flexible (in a meaningful way) about directionality than the feasible-path uRPF. It can potentially alleviate ISPs' concerns about the possibility of disrupting service for their customers, and encourage greater deployment of uRPF techniques.</t>
