      <t>Stateless Address Mapping (SAM) is a generic mechanism to statelesslyestablish tunnels, point-to-multipoint, for packets of an addressfamily that traverse domains whose routing is in another addressfamily (mesh softwires). It extends tunneling principles of [6rd] toother address-family combination than IPv6 across IPv4 domains. Itthus introduces, for a variety of use cases, a simpler mesh-softwiremodel than that of [RFC5565].Among SAM use cases, some are solutions to previously unsolvedproblems: native IPv6 across IPv4 NATs, with optimized paths;multihoming with independent CPEs and provider-aggregatable prefixes;public IPv4 addresses across IPv6-only domains with optimized paths;static sharing of IPv4 addresses, without impact on routinginformation bases.</t>
