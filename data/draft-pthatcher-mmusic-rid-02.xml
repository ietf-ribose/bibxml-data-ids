      <t>In this specification, we define a framework for identifying Source RTP Streams with the constraints on its payload format in the Session Description Protocol. This framework uses "rid" SDP attribute to: a) effectively identify the Source RTP Streams within a RTP Session, b) constrain their payload format parameters in a codec-agnostic way beyond what is provided with the regular Payload Types and c) enable unambiguous mapping between the Source RTP Streams to their media format specification in the SDP. Note-1: The name 'rid' is not yet finalized. Please refer to Section 12 for more details on the naming.</t>
