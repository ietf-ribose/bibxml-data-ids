    <abstract>
      <t>Massive data processing and complex algorithm applications in the industrial Internet require a large amount of computing resources. At the same time, real-time control requirements and production safety requirements require network reliability and certainty. This draft proposes a service-oriented task process processing framework, which divides the execution process of services into two stages, namely resource orchestration of task flow and packet transmission scheduling. In order to obtain the optimal scheduling strategy, a constrained optimization problem is developed, which aims to maximize the success rate of transmission scheduling while compromising load balancing and resource utilization. In order to improve the reliability of the network, the TSN-5G converged network architecture is used to transmit data packets.</t>
