      <t>This document presents a revised version of the global HAHA protocol specification. Global HAHA allows the deployment of Home Agents over the Internet for reliability, scalability and performance purposes. This version clarifies several issues that were vague in the original specification. Global HAHA makes use of the signaling defined by the Home Agent Reliability protocol (HARP) although it is not designed to operate in conjunction with HARP.</t>
