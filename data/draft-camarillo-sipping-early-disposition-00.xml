      <t>This document defines a new disposition type (early-session) for theContent-Disposition header field in SIP. The treatment of'early-session' bodies is similar to the treatment of 'sessionbodies. That is, they follow the offer/answer model. Their onlydifference is that session descriptions whose disposition type is'early-session' are used to establish early media sessions withinearly dialogs, as opposed to regular sessions within regular dialog</t>
