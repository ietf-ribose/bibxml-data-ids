      <t>This document defines a new disposition type (early-session) for the Content-Disposition header field in SIP. The treatment of 'early-session' bodies is similar to the treatment of 'session bodies. That is, they follow the offer/answer model. Their only difference is that session descriptions whose disposition type is 'early-session' are used to establish early media sessions within early dialogs, as opposed to regular sessions within regular dialog</t>
