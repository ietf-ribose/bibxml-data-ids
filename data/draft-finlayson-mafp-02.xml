      <t>The Internet has recently seen the emergence of applications that involve the ongoing transmission, or ''pushing'', of structured data from a server to one or more client nodes. Most current applications send this data using unicast communications - usually over TCP connections. However, similar applications can also be implemented using multicast-based protocols. Multicast not only improves the scalability of this particular class of application, but also makes possible an additional class of application in which the participants can act as peers - sending data as well as receiving. This Internet Draft describes the ''Multicast Attribute Framing Protocol'' (MAFP) - a generic, attribute-based data representation, intended for a wide variety of multicast-based applications. It is currently being used to implement the ''multikit'' generic multicast session browser (http://www.lvn.com/multikit). This draft describes an early version of MAFP that is likely to undergo changes in the future. However, it is being described now, in the hope that it will promote open discussion of this and similar protocols - ideally leading to the adoption of an open, interoperable standard for this class of application.</t>
