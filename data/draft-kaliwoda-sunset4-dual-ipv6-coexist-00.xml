      <t>Some networks are expected to support IPv4-only, dual-stack, and IPv6-only hosts at the same time. Such networks may want to add IPv6/IPv4 translation for the IPv6-only host so it can access servers on the IPv4 Internet. Adding translation service to the IPv6-enabled network may change dual-stack host behavior and affect the way deployed network is working. This document defines the problem statement for such networks.</t>
