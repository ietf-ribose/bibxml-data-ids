    <abstract>
      <t>Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution [RFC7432] describes DF election procedures for multi-homing Ethernet Segments. These procedures are enhanced further in [RFC8584] by applying Highest Random Weight Algorithm for DF election in order to avoid DF status unnecessarily upon a failure. This draft makes further improvement to DF election procedures in [RFC8584] by providing two options for fast DF election upon recovery of the failed link or node associated with the multi-homing Ethernet Segment. This fast DF election is achieved independent of number of EVIs associated with that Ethernet Segment and it is performed via a simple signaling between the recovered PE and each PE in the multi-homing group.</t>
