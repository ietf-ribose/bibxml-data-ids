    <abstract>
      <t>The 3rd party call control draft [2] demonstrates a usage of SIP [3] with some of the enhancements of RFC2543bis [4]. This usage requires that a 3pcc controller remain in the signaling path and maintain state for the duration of the call. While this is necessary in certain situations (ex: protocol translation: H.323 [5] to SIP, SIP to RTSP [6], HTTP [7] to SIP), it is sub-optimal in pure SIP environments. This draft demonstrates a usage of the REFER method [8] and SIP for presence [9] to allow authorized peers to participate in call control.</t>
