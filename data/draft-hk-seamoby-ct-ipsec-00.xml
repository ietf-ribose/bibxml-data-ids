      <t>There are a large number of IP access networks where one may wish to provide security for end user traffic, or secure the access network from unauthorized traffic. One protocol which may be used to provide these services is IPSec, which requires a node to establish a security association with the access network in order to obtain these services. Traditionally, such an association is considered static, however, there are many situations in which the ability to move an IPSec security association (SA) from one security gateway (SG) to another within the access network may be beneficial. Examples of this include IPSec handover in mobile LANs and PANs, load-balancing between IPSec SGs, and fail-over applications where high-availability is required.</t>
