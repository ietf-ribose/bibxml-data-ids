      <t>The IETF is specifying a protocol for network-based localized mobility management, which takes basic operation for registration, tunnel management and de-registration into account. This document specifies a protocol for route optimization in networks, which support network-based mobility management. The specified protocol focuses on efficient set up and maintenance of a route optimized path between two mobile nodes and suits complex mobility scenarios as well as networks with multiple mobility anchors.</t>
