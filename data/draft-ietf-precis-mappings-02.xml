      <t>The framework for preparation and comparison of internationalized strings ("PRECIS") defines several classes of strings for preparation and comparison. In the framework, case mapping is defined because many protocols handle case-sensitive or case-insensitive string comparison and therefore preparation of the string is mandatory. As described in the mapping for Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) and the PRECIS problem statement, mappings for internationalized strings are not limited to case, but also width mapping and mapping of delimiters and other specials can be taken into consideration. This document provides guidelines for authors of protocol profiles of the PRECIS framework and describes several mappings that can be applied between receiving user input and passing permitted code points to internationalized protocols. The mappings described here are expected to be applied as Addtional mapping in the PRECIS framework.</t>
