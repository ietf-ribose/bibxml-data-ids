      <t>The canonical format for RFCs is called RFCXML, with the currently effective details originally documented in the RFC 799x series. This format has experienced some uncontrolled evolution since, partially caused by an unwillingness to recognize the need for overt, deliberate evolution. Controlled RFCXML evolution is going to be complex. Its discussion will need agreed terminology, without which it will devolve into a Tower of Babel.</t>
