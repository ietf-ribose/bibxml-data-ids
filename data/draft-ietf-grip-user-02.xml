      <t>The purpose of this document is to provide information to the gen- eral Internet community regarding security expectations of Internet Ser- vice Providers (ISPs). It is not the intent of this document to define a set of require- ments that would be appropriate for all ISPs, but rather to provide the community with a framework for discussion of security expectations with current and prospective service providers. This document is written from the perspective of the consumer. Companion documents provide information from the ISP perspective.</t>
