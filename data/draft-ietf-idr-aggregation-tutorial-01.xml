      <t>Route aggregation is critical to the long-term viability of the Internet. This document presents practical information that network managers can use to both understand the concepts of aggregation as well as put those concepts into use in order to do their part to make the Internet stable and allow its continued growth. The intended audience for this document is anyone responsible for configuring a network which has its own Autonomous System Number (ASN) and exchanges routing information with its Internet Service Provider(s) (ISP(s)) using the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). This document does not cover multi-homing, though multi-homed sites can still benefit from understanding this material.</t>
