    <abstract>
      <t>BMP (BGP Monitoring Protocol) is perfectly suited for real-time consumption but less ideal in stream processing and off-wire historical scenarios. The main issue is that the ability to correctly parse BGP Update PDUs, carried in BMP Route Monitoring messages, depends on the BGP Capabilities exchanged during the establishment of the BGP session between the peers via BGP Open PDUs. The BGP Open PDUs, carried in BMP Peer Up Notification messages, are exported at the establishment of the BMP session. Similar to BGP, BMP sessions are typically long-lived, so the crucial information to correctly parse subsequent messages of such sessions was possibly sent a relatively long time ago (days, weeks, months). This document introduces the concept of Summaries. It defines a new optional BMP message type, called State Summary, and a new TLV, called Summary Id. A Summary is similar to the initial synchronisation performed upon establishment of the BMP session: all BGP session information is exported in Peer Up Notification messages, and all RIB contents are exported in Route Monitoring messages. All the messages carry the new Summary Id TLV, containing an ID uniquely identifying the summary these messages belong to. The messages are preceded by a State Summary message carrying the same Summary Id TLV, as well as meta-data describing the Summary.</t>
