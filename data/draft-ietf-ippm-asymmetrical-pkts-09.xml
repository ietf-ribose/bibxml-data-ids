    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies an optional extension to the Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) to control the length and/or number of packets sent by a Session-Reflector in response to a single test packet from the Session-Sender during a STAMP test session. By default, a STAMP Session-Sender and Session-Reflector exchange packets symmetrically: the number of packets sent by the Session- Reflector and the Session-Sender are the same as is the length of the packets sent by the Session-Reflector and the Session-Sender. However, there are cases where a Session-Reflector responding with Asymmetrical Packets would ensure a closer approximation between active performance measurements and the conditions experienced by monitored application. The STAMP extension proposed in this document allows the operator to establish tests where a Session-Reflector sends Asymmetrical Packets, packets whose length is not symmetrical to test packet sent by the Session-Sender and/or packets that are not sent in direct response to a packet received from a Session-Sender. The document also includes an analysis of challenges related to performance monitoring in a multicast network. It specifies procedures and STAMP extensions to achieve more efficient measurements with a lesser impact on a network.</t>
