      <t>[RFC7001] describes a header field called Authentication-Results for use with electronic mail messages to indicate the results of message authentication efforts. Any receiver-side software, mainly Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) or mail filters, can add or use this header field to relay that information in a convenient and meaningful way to later-stage systems, such as for sorting and filtering decisions. One portion of the definition in that document limits the types of authentication properties about a message to a small, fixed set. This document updates the specification, making it extensible to allow new property types to be declared and used.</t>
