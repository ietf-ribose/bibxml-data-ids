    <abstract>
      <t>In basic PMIPv6[RFC5213], Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) should forward all traffic for the registered MN. Localized Routing (LR) for PMIPv6 proposed in [RFC6705] allows MN to exchange data directly by using localized forwarding or tunnel between the MAGs. But in some multi- access scenarios, it is apparently suboptimal. The present document proposes two localized routing mechanisms that are compatible with RFC 6705 for multi-access MNs which have some interfaces attached to the same MAGs.</t>
