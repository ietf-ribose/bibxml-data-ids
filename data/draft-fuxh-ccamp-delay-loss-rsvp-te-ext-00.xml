      <t>The key driver for latency is stock/commodity trading applications. Financial or trading companies are very focused on end-to-end private pipe line latency optimizations that improve things 2-3 ms. Latency and latency SLA is one of the key parameters that these "high value" customers use to select a private pipe line provider. This document extends RSVP-TE protocol to promote SLA experince of latency application.</t>
