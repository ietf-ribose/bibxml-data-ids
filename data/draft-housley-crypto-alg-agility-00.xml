      <t>Many IETF protocols may use of cryptographic algorithms to provide confidentiality, integrity, or non-repudiation. Communicating peers must support the same cryptographic algorithm or algorithms for these mechanisms to work properly. This memo provides guidelines for ensuring that such a protocol has the ability to migrate from one algorithm to another over time.</t>
