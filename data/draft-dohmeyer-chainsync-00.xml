    <abstract>
      <t>ChainSync is a lightweight application-layer protocol that runs over reliable TCP connections to synchronize a fixed linear chain of distributed processes (labeled A, B, C,..., N) such that they execute their local tasks in strict sequential order (A -&gt; B -&gt; C -&gt;... -&gt; N) *and only after every process in the chain has confirmed it is ready*. The protocol uses three distinct phases:</t>
