    <abstract>
      <t>It is well recognised by all micro and macro-mobility routingprotocols that Mobile IP (MIP) is likely to be used to supportinter-domain mobility. It is also widely accepted that Mobile IPcould be used as the basis for signalling between the mobile and themicro-mobility domains for simplicity of the mobile terminal andinteroperability purposes. The Edge Mobility Architecture (EMA)defines a generic IP hand-over model which operates in conjunctionwith a Mobility Enhanced Routing (MER) protocol to provide large-scale, intra-domain, IP address mobility. The aim of this documentis to describe the minimum MIP signalling requirements for EMA:MER,and to propose additional changes necessary to [MIPv6] and [MIPv4]for them to support EMA:MER. The document deals with mobiles movinginside and between EMA:MER domains as well as coming and goingfrom/to non-EMA:MER domains, demonstrating EMA/MIP interoperabilityand inter-domain hand-overs. The document also demonstrates thebenefits a mobile and an operator will see when a mobile host iswithin an EMA domain.</t>
