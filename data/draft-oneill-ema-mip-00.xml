    <abstract>
      <t>It is well recognised by all micro and macro-mobility routing protocols that Mobile IP (MIP) is likely to be used to support inter-domain mobility. It is also widely accepted that Mobile IP could be used as the basis for signalling between the mobile and the micro-mobility domains for simplicity of the mobile terminal and interoperability purposes. The Edge Mobility Architecture (EMA) defines a generic IP hand-over model which operates in conjunction with a Mobility Enhanced Routing (MER) protocol to provide large- scale, intra-domain, IP address mobility. The aim of this document is to describe the minimum MIP signalling requirements for EMA:MER, and to propose additional changes necessary to [MIPv6] and [MIPv4] for them to support EMA:MER. The document deals with mobiles moving inside and between EMA:MER domains as well as coming and going from/to non-EMA:MER domains, demonstrating EMA/MIP interoperability and inter-domain hand-overs. The document also demonstrates the benefits a mobile and an operator will see when a mobile host is within an EMA domain.</t>
