      <t>The IPv6 interim mechanism 6to4 [6TO4] uses automatic IPv6-over-IPv4tunneling to interconnect IPv6 networks. The architecture includesRelay Routers and Routers, which accept and decapsulate IPv4 trafficfrom anywhere. There aren't many constraints on the embedded IPv6packets, or where IPv4 traffic will be automatically tunneled to.These could enable one to go around access controls, and more likely,being able to perform proxy Denial of Service attacks using Relays asreflectors. This document discusses these issues and tries tosuggest enhancements to alleviate the problems.</t>
