    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a method called "dry-run DNSSEC" that allows for testing DNSSEC deployments without affecting the DNS service in case of DNSSEC errors. It accomplishes that by introducing a new DS Type Digest Algorithm that signals validating resolvers that dry-run DNSSEC is used for the zone. DNSSEC errors are then reported with DNS Error Reporting, but any bogus responses to clients are withheld. Instead, validating resolvers fallback from dry-run DNSSEC and provide the response that would have been answered without the presence of a dry-run DS. A further option is presented for clients to opt-in for dry-run DNSSEC errors and allow for end-to-end DNSSEC testing.</t>
