      <t>Recently there are a number of efforts trying to connect the packet- switching network with circuit-switching network, especially the Internet with public telephone networks. The first problem of such interconnection is naming and addressing, which are described in some other drafts ([dnsurl], [telurl1], [faxemail]). This draft gives a brief framework on what the problems we may have in architecture and technology when connecting these two networks, and the possible solutions for these problems.</t>
