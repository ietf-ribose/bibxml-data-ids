      <t>This document describes a new network quality framework named Quality of Outcome (QoO). The QoO framework is unique among network quality frameworks because it is designed to meet the needs of application developers, users and operators. This is achieved by basing the framework on Quality Attenuation, defining a simple format for specifying application requirements, and defining a way to compute a simple and intuitive user-facing metric. The framework proposes a way of sampling network quality, setting network quality requirements and a formula for calculating the probability for the sampled network to satisfy network requirements.</t>
