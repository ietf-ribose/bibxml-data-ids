      <t>The purpose of this document is to propose a protocol called Telephony Tunneling Protocol (TTP) to tunnel one or more plain old telephone system (POTS) connections between two Internet hosts. The hosts may have one or more telephones connected directly to them or may receive calls from the local Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). The Internet hosts are connected via two or more TCP connections (one for control and each of the others for one channel of voice traffic). This document makes no specification for sending Signaling System 7 (SS7) or other PSTN control commands through the control connection, though such commands may be outlined in other documents. Comments are solicited and should be sent to the author, Michael Ross &lt;rossmi@attbi.com&gt;</t>
