      <t>The purpose of this document is to propose a protocol called TelephonyTunneling Protocol (TTP) to tunnel one or more plain old telephonesystem (POTS) connections between two Internet hosts. The hosts mayhave one or more telephones connected directly to them or may receivecalls from the local Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). TheInternet hosts are connected via two or more TCP connections (one forcontrol and each of the others for one channel of voice traffic).This document makes no specification for sending Signaling System 7(SS7) or other PSTN control commands through the control connection,though such commands may be outlined in other documents.Comments are solicited and should be sent to the author, Michael Ross&lt;rossmi@attbi.com&gt;</t>
