      <t>This draft presents a number of use cases of applications running on endpoints located in cellular networks and whose performances highly depend on network information. This document first, shows how the performances of these applications can be further improved with ALTO provided abstracted network information and transportation means thereof. Second, upon reviewing the existing ALTO capabilities, it lists the ALTO features that need to be extended or defined to support the presented use cases.</t>
