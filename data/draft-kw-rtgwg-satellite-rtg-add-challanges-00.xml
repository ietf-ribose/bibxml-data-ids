      <t>Future networks, including the Internet, will utilize an increasing amount of space-based transport infrastructure. Control and transport between Earth-based and space-based networks present several problems - high dynamicity, spatial connectivity, continual movement tracking and prediction, ocular obstruction, integration with existing Internet infrastructure, all of which challenge existing architectures, routing mechanisms and addressing schemes. This document summerises near-to-mid-term space-networking problems; it outlines the key components, challenges, and requirements for integrating future space-based network infrastructure with existing networks and mechanisms. Furthermore, this document highlights the network control and transport interconnection, and identify the resources and functions required for successful interconnection of space-based and Earth-based Internet infrastructure.</t>
