      <t>Chinese can be written in 2 different scripts, traditional Chinese andsimplified Chinese, that cannot be distinguished by many people ofcertain background/cultures/groups who use them interchangeably. As aresult, users of Chinese Domain Names (CDN) have special needs that canonly be satisfied by adding a label to CDNs that distinguish a CDN withtraditional characters from a CDN with simplified characters. Thislabeling is an entire system that can be accomplished with SLDs or bycreating a new type of TLD called Language Script TLD (lsTLD). Thisdraft describes the benefits that the system will provide and thetechniques involved in implementing it.</t>
