    <abstract>
      <t>Chinese can be written in 2 different scripts, traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese, that cannot be distinguished by many people of certain background/cultures/groups who use them interchangeably. As a result, users of Chinese Domain Names (CDN) have special needs that can only be satisfied by adding a label to CDNs that distinguish a CDN with traditional characters from a CDN with simplified characters. This labeling is an entire system that can be accomplished with SLDs or by creating a new type of TLD called Language Script TLD (lsTLD). This draft describes the benefits that the system will provide and the techniques involved in implementing it.</t>
