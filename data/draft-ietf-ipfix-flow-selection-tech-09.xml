      <t>Flow selection is the process of selecting a subset of flows from all observed flows. The Flow Selection Process may be located at an observation point, or on an IPFIX Mediator. Flow selection reduces the effort of post-processing flow data and transferring Flow Records. This document describes motivations for flow selection and presents flow selection techniques. It provides an information model for configuring flow selection techniques and discusses what information about a flow selection process should be exported.</t>
