      <t>This document describes a solution that is able to handle SIP signaling together with NAT enabled firewalls. The intent is to show that existing firewalls do not have to be replaced by 'SIP enabled' ones, instead they will only have to be reconfigured slightly. The main feature of this solution is using MGCP from a session control proxy to open/close holes in an RTP proxy which then enables RTP traffic to flow between interconnected networks. Worth noting is that this solution will not only work for SIP, it will also work for other protocols, such as H.323 or Real Audio. It does not even have to be RTP that is passed through the RTP proxy, though this draft assumes that the RTP stream is accompanied by RTCP. The solution will work for any protocol that wishes to open/close ports dynamically in the RTP proxy (maybe it should be called Forwarding Engine in the general case).</t>
