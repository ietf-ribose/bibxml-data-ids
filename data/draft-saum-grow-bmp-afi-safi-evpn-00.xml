    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines EVPN-specific BMP statistics types that extend the generic BMP RIB statistics defined in draft-ietf-grow-bmp-bgp- rib-stats. It includes counters for EVPN multihoming for both layer-2 and layer-3 (IP aliasing), dynamic IVRL, route-map application on routes, and EVPN route-type visibility for all route- types from 1 to 8. The Border Gateway Protocol Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides a convenient interface for obtaining BGP-related data. This document extends BMP RIB statistics to include EVPN-specific counters and metrics, enabling enhanced visibility into EVPN route processing and behavior. This document registers new EVPN BMP statistic type identifiers in the BMP Statistics Type registry. These identifiers are used to represent EVPN-specific counters in BMP messages.</t>
