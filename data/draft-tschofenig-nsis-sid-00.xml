    <abstract>
      <t>As one result of the analysis activities in the NSIS group it was realized that mobility and the ability to change the flow identifier causes problems with existing QoS reservations. To be able to associate a signaling message with existing state an identifier other than the flow identifier had to be used. Such an abstraction is achieved with the session identifier which allows identification of established state independently of the flow characteristics.</t>
