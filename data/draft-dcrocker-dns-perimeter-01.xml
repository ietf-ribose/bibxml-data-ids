      <t>The Domain Name System (DNS) naming syntax provides no meta-data for indicating administrative transitions through the hierarchy. For example, it does not distinguish the higher-level portions that operate as public registries, versus those that operate as private organizations. This specification creates a basic overlay mechanism for defining a logical Perimeter between administrative entities through the naming hierarchy. The mechanism can then be applied for a variety of independent administrative indications.</t>
