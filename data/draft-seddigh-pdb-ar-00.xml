    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a diffserv per-domain behaviour (PDB) called Assured Rate (AR). The AR PDB is suitable for carrying traffic aggregates that require rate assurance but do not require delay and jitter bounds. The traffic aggregate will also have the opportunity to obtain excess bandwidth beyond the assured rate. The PDB can be created using the diffserv AF PHB along with suitable policers at the domain ingress nodes.</t>
