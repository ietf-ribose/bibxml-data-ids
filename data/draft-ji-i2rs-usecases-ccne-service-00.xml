      <t>With the development of network technologies, more and more applications need to have a central control point for the network elements in one administrative domain, such central control point is a central control network element (CCNE). CCNE controls the network elements in its administrative domain, the type of CCNE can be RR Router, PCE Server, or a federation of RR Router and PCE Server, etc. CCNE is developed from the traditional network element, which plus some I2RS interfaces, can provide both traditional network services and I2RS services. This document describes requirement and use cases for which I2RS can be used for CCNE device. The use cases described in this document encompass: Control IP Network by RR Router, Control MPLS TE Network by PCE Server. The goal is to inform the community's understanding of where the I2RS CCNE extensions fit within the overall I2RS architecture. It is intended to provide a basis for the solutions draft describing the set of interfaces for the CCNE device.</t>
