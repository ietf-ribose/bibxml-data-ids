    <abstract>
      <t>There are a number of instances in which the search for a particular value (for instance, a cryptographic key) can be distributed across a large number of machines, however there is not currently a standard protocol for doing so. A great many algorithms may be used for searches; because these algorithms may differ greatly, the protocol used must be flexible enough to be easily extended.</t>
