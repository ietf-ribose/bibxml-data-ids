      <t>This memo presents a technique for using the hostname acquired from a DHCPv4 client request to publish AAAA records on that domain name for public IPv6 addresses acquired by the same dual-stack host using SLAAC. On dual-stack networks, there is a need to automatically publish entries in the DNS for the public IPv6 addresses of an IPv6 host when it does not use DHCPv6. IPv6 hosts can acquire IPv6 addresses using SLAAC, but there is no mechanism allowing them to register a name in the DNS database other than a DNS update, which would create a very difficult key management problem. By combining the DHCPv4 hostname or client FQDN option with information acquired using ICMPv6, a lightweight DHCPv4 server on a home gateway or SOHO gateway can automatically publish AAAA records for such hosts.</t>
