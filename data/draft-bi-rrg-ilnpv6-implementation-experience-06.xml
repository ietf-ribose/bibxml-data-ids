      <t>The Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) defines an evolutionary enhancement to IP to address multi-homing, mobility as well as other issues. This document provides experience of implementing ILNPv6 which is a specific engineering instance of ILNP based on IPv6. This document describes the problems arisen and our choices to solve the issues which may be helpful to others in implementing the protocol.</t>
