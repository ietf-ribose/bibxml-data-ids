    <abstract>
      <t>Messaging Layer Security (MLS) provides strong end-to-end security guarantees for group messaging including Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise Security (PCS). To facilitate agreement between group members, MLS requires a Delivery Service (DS) component that orders of the handshake messages (Commits) that allow changes to the group state. In decentralized settings without a central authoritative entity to enforce ordering, group members will likely have to retain key material so they can process Commits out-of-order. Retaining key material, however, significantly reduces the FS of the protocol. This draft specifies Decentralized MLS (DMLS), based on the Fork-Resilient Continuous Group Key Agreement protocol FREEK proposed by Alwen et al. [FRCGKA]. In essence, DMLS extends MLS such that key material can be retained to process Commits out-of- order with recuded impact to FS, thus allowing safer deployment in decentralized environments.</t>
