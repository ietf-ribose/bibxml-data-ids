      <t>Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) is a protocol defined in multiple RFCs for enabling communication between a Path Computation Elements (PCEs) and Path Computation Clients (PCCs). Although PCEP defines various LSP identifiers, attributes, and constraints, there are operational attributes available on the PCC that can enhance path computation and improve the debugging experience, which are not currently supported in PCEP. This document proposes extensions to PCEP to include: * Support for explicit or dynamic path types. * Mechanisms to mark LSPs as eligible for use as transit LSPs. * A fallback to Binding label/Segment Identifier (SID) allocation by</t>
