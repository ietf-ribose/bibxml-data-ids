      <t>The service location protocol provides a framework for the discovery and selection of network services. It relies on multicast support at the network layer of the protocol stack it is using. It does not specifically rely upon the TCP/IP protocol stack but makes use of concepts that are found in most TCP/IP protocol implementations. Traditionally, users find services using the name of a network host (a human readable text string) which is an alias for a network address. The service location protocol eliminates the need for a user to know the name of a network host supporting a service. Rather, the user supplies a set of attributes which describe the service. The service location protocol allows the user to bind this description to the network address of the service.</t>
