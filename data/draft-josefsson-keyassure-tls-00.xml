      <t>TLS supports X.509 and OpenPGP certificate based mechanisms toauthenticate a server. Users want their applications to verify thatthe certificate provided by the TLS server is in fact associated withthe domain name they expect. Instead of trusting a certificateauthority to have made this association correctly, and an X.509/OpenPGP implementation to validate that properly, the user mightinstead trust the authoritative DNS server for the domain name tomake that association. This document describes how to use secure DNSto associate the certificate chain transferred by TLS with theintended domain name.</t>
