      <t>according to RFC 5654 MPLS-TP Requirement, there are two requirements: requirement 56.B Recovery techniques used for P2P and P2MP shouldbe identical to simplify implementation and operation.anotherrequirement as section 2.5.6.1 describles: within the context ofrecovery in MPLS-TP networks,the optimization criteria considered inring topologies are as follows: 1 minimize the number of OAM entitiesthat are needed to trigger the recovery operation; 2 Minimize thenumber of elements of recovery in the ring; 3 Minimize the number oflabels required for the protection paths across the ring; 4 minimizethe amount of control and management plane transactions duringmaintenance operation. this decument will describle and provide twotypes of ring protection solutions. both solutions can satisfy theserequirements of recovery in mpls-tp ring network.</t>
