      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network-based centralized mobility management protocol, which has many disadvantages for utilizing the centralized anchor LMA. As networks are moving towards flat architectures, a distributed approach is needed to PMIPv6. This document defines a robust solution for PMIPv6-based distributed mobility management which ensures the robustness by organizing the distributed anchors (MAARs) into a Chord ring.</t>
