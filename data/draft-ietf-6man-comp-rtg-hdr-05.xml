    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an experiment in which two new IPv6 Routing headers are implemented and deployed. Collectively, they are called the Compact Routing Headers (CRH). Individually, they are called CRH-16 and CRH-32. One purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate that the CRH can be implemented and deployed in a production network. Another purpose is to demonstrate that the security considerations, described in this document, can be addressed with access control lists. Finally, this document encourages replication of the experiment.</t>
