      <t>In Proxy Mobile IPv6, one prefix can only be assigned to oneinterface of a mobile node by the local mobility anchor (LMA) anddifferent mobile nodes can not share this home network prefix.Managing per-MN's interface home network prefixes is likely toincrease the processing load at the LMA. Based on the idea thatDynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) servers canmanage prefixes, we propose a new technique in which LMA offloadsdelegation and release tasks of the prefixes to the DHCPv6 server.LMA requests a prefix for an incoming mobile node to the DHCPv6server. Based on this prefix, the mobile node can create a homeaddress for its interface. When the mobile station leaves thenetwork, the prefix is returned to the DHCPv6 server.Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers can alsoplay a role in prefix delegation.</t>
