      <t>This document describes inter-site signaling procedures in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs that allow the same multicast stream to flow simultaneously on multiple inter-PE paths without duplicates being sent to receivers. Those procedures are independent of multicast tunnel technology used in service provider network as well as of the protocol used to exchange multicast signaling among PE's. The document specifies necessary information elements and their exchange process for the desired MVPN operation.</t>
