      <t>As discussed in [1], the need for survivable optical networks is critical, and introducing capabilities that further enhance network survivability continues to be an essential objective. This is particularly important for operators with stringent requirements for network resilience and service survivability. However, disruption of service can result not only from faults, but also from scheduled maintenance procedures. This draft introduces some additional considerations and carrier needs related to failure recovery and scheduled maintenance work in switched optical networks. These are of critical importance for serving -business customers who require super high quality service assurance and pay correspondingly high tariffs in order to guarantee this level of QoS.</t>
