    <abstract>
      <t>The procedure to handle host mobility in a layer 2 Network with EVPN control plane is defined as part of [RFC7432]. EVPN has since evolved to find wider applicability across various IRB use cases that include distributing both MAC and IP reachability via a common EVPN control plane. MAC Mobility procedures defined in [RFC7432] are extensible to IRB use cases if a fixed 1:1 mapping between VM IP and MAC is assumed across VM moves. Generic mobility support for IP and MAC addresses that allows these bindings to change across moves is required to support a broader set of EVPN IRB use cases. EVPN all- active multi-homing further introduces scenarios that require additional consideration from mobility perspective. This document enumerates a set of design considerations applicable to mobility across these EVPN IRB use cases and updates sequence number assignment procedures defined in [RFC7432] to address these IRB use cases.</t>
