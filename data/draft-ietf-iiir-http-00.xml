      <t>HTTP is a protocol with the lightness and speed necessary for a distributed collaborative hypermedia information system. It is a generic stateless object-oriented protocol, which may be used for many similar tasks such as name servers, and distributed object-oriented systems, by extending the commands, or 'methods', used. A feature if HTTP is the negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently of the development of new advanced representations.</t>
