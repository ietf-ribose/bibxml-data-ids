      <t>The purpose of this draft is to describe an information model for representing MPLS traffic engineering policies. RFC 2702, 'Requirements for Traffic Engineering over MPLS', is used as a basis for determining the types of information that need to be represented in such an information model. The latter document describes the functional capabilities required to implement policies that facilitate efficient and reliable network operations in an MPLS domain. The information model described in this draft attempts to capture the information required to enable the functional capabilities described in RFC 2702. This information model could be used by a management system to optimize network performance through the necessary network provisioning actions. An overview of policy-based management is given in this document, along with a description of the relationship of this work to other information models that are being defined in the IETF Policy Framework working group. This is followed by a detailed description of the information model, and a number of examples illustrating its use.</t>
