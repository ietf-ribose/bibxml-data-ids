      <t>The purpose of this draft is to describe an information model forrepresenting MPLS traffic engineering policies. RFC 2702,'Requirements for Traffic Engineering over MPLS', is used as a basisfor determining the types of information that need to be representedin such an information model. The latter document describes thefunctional capabilities required to implement policies thatfacilitate efficient and reliable network operations in an MPLSdomain. The information model described in this draft attempts tocapture the information required to enable the functionalcapabilities described in RFC 2702. This information model could beused by a management system to optimize network performance throughthe necessary network provisioning actions.An overview of policy-based management is given in this document,along with a description of the relationship of this work to otherinformation models that are being defined in the IETF PolicyFramework working group. This is followed by a detailed descriptionof the information model, and a number of examples illustrating itsuse.</t>
