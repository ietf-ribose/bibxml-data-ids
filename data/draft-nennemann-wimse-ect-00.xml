      <t>This document defines Execution Context Tokens (ECTs), a JWT-based extension to the WIMSE architecture that records task execution across distributed agentic workflows. Each ECT is a signed record of a single task, linked to predecessor tasks through a directed acyclic graph (DAG). ECTs reuse the WIMSE signing model and are transported in a new Execution-Context HTTP header field alongside existing WIMSE identity headers.</t>
