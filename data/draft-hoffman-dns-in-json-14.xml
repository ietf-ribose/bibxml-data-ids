      <t>Some applications use DNS messages, or parts of DNS messages, as data. For example, a system that captures DNS queries and responses might want to be able to easily search those without having to decode the messages each time. Another example is a system that puts together DNS queries and responses from message parts. This document describes a general format for DNS message data in JSON. Specific profiles of this document can be described in other documents for specific applications and usage scenarios.</t>
