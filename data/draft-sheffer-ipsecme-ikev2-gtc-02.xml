      <t>Despite many years of effort, simple username-password authentication is still prevalent. In many cases a password is the only credential available to the end user. IKEv2 uses EAP as a sub-protocol for user authentication. This provides a well-specified and extensible architecture. To this day EAP does not provide a simple password- based authentication method. The only existing password authentication methods either require the peer to know the password in advance (EAP-MD5), or are needlessly complex when used within IKEv2 (e.g. PEAP). This document codifies the common practice of using EAP-GTC for this type of authentication, with the goal of achieving maximum interoperability. The various security issues are extensively analyzed.</t>
