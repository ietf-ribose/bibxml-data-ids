      <t>This document adds terms and abbreviations to "DNS Terminology" (RFC 8499) that relate to DNS running over various transports, as well as terms and abbreviations for DNS resolution at traditional and non- traditional locations. [[ This is an early attempt at these terms. They will probably be improved over time. ]]</t>
