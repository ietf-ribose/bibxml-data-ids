      <t>This draft analyzes the behaviors that residential end users and home network owners (e.g., parents of young children) might experience when operating systems and clients support [I-D.ietf-add-ddr] and/or [I-D.ietf-add-dnr] for discovery of encrypted DNS services and the CE router of the home network offers itself as the Do53 resolver. This use case is explicitly mentioned in [I-D.ietf-add-requirements] Section 3.2 and has several requirements related to it. This draft has two goals: determine if the analysis it provides is accurate and, if it is accurate, determine if the behavior is acceptable to the WG or if there should be changes to either of the discovery mechanisms.</t>
