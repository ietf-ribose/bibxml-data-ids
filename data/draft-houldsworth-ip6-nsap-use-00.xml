      <t>This document defines a proposed replacement for the recommendation in draft-carpenter-ip6-nsap-map-00.txt for mapping OSI NSAP addresses into IPv6. It carries existing NSAP addresses transparently (without any conversion) and conveys any additional bytes which cannot be accommodated in the basic 16 byte IPv6 address space in an optional Hop by Hop extension header. It can thus support all existing NSAP address schemes which have been defined by The ISO and The ITU-T, including those which utilise the full 20 byte maximum address length, and allows existing NSAP address schemes which have been deployed globally to be retained intact. It can also be extended to cover other addressing schemes, such as IPX.</t>
