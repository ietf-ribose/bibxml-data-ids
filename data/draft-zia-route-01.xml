    <abstract>
      <t>The Real-time Transport Object delivery over Unidirectional Transport protocol (ROUTE protocol) is specified for robust delivery of Application Objects, including Application Objects with real-time delivery constraints, to receivers over a unidirectional transport. Application Objects consist of data that has meaning to applications that use the ROUTE protocol for delivery of data to receivers, for example, it can be a file, or a DASH or HLS segment, a WAV audio clip, etc. The ROUTE protocol also supports low-latency streaming applications. The ROUTE protocol is suitable for unicast, broadcast, and multicast transport. Therefore, it can be run over IP/UDP including multicast IP. The ROUTE protocol can leverage the features of the underlying protocol layer, e.g. to provide security it can leverage IP security protocols such as IPSec. This document specifies the ROUTE protocol such that it could be used by a variety of applications for delivery of Application Objects by specifying their own profiles of this protocol (e.g. by adding or constraining some features).</t>
