      <t>As use of the Internet has become widespread, it's become increasinglyclear that the URL -- the mechanism most users employ to designateresources -- is inherently confusing to non-technical users, and to agreat extent, is unusable by them. For that reason, an easier namingscheme that employs human-friendly names ('HFNs') is desirable andnecessary. Such schemes have been discussed at length in RFCs 1737[1],2276[2] and 2168[3].As use of the Internet has become widespread, it's become increasinglyclear that the URL -- the mechanism most users employ to designateresources -- is inherently confusing to non-technical users, and to agreat extent, is unusable by them.
