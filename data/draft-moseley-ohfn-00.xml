      <t>As use of the Internet has become widespread, it's become increasingly clear that the URL -- the mechanism most users employ to designate resources -- is inherently confusing to non-technical users, and to a great extent, is unusable by them. For that reason, an easier naming scheme that employs human-friendly names ('HFNs') is desirable and necessary. Such schemes have been discussed at length in RFCs 1737[1], 2276[2] and 2168[3].
