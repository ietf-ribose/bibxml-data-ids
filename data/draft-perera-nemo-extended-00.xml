      <t>This draft proposes a solution for extended network mobility support, that is a mechanism to enable optimal routing between mobile network nodes and its correspondent nodes. The proposed scheme not only provides optimal routing for the mobility aware nodes but also maintains the benefits of mobility transparency. Our solution achieves route optimization by expecting the Mobile Router to take the role of an Access Router thereby reducing the number of external signaling messages a node behind the Mobile Router needs to perform. In order to further reduce the number of signaling messages beyond the scope of the mobile network we further propose the Mobile Router to play the role of an Home Agent for NEMO-enabled nodes.</t>
