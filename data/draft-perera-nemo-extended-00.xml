      <t>This draft proposes a solution for extended network mobility support,that is a mechanism to enable optimal routing between mobile networknodes and its correspondent nodes. The proposed scheme not onlyprovides optimal routing for the mobility aware nodes but alsomaintains the benefits of mobility transparency. Our solutionachieves route optimization by expecting the Mobile Router to takethe role of an Access Router thereby reducing the number of externalsignaling messages a node behind the Mobile Router needs to perform.In order to further reduce the number of signaling messages beyondthe scope of the mobile network we further propose the Mobile Routerto play the role of an Home Agent for NEMO-enabled nodes.</t>
