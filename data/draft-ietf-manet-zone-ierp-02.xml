      <t>This document describes the Interzone Routing Protocol (IERP), the reactive routing component of the Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP). IERP adapts existing reactive routing protocol implementations to take advantage of the known topology of each node's surrounding R-hop neighborhood (routing zone), provided by the Intrazone Routing Protocol (IARP). The availability of routing zone routes allows IERP to suppress route queries for local destinations. When a global route discovery is required, the routing zone based bordercast service can be used to efficiently guide route queries outward, rather than blindly relaying queries from neighbor to neighbor. Once a route has been discovered, IERP can use routing zones to automatically redirect data around failed links. Similarly, suboptimal route segments can be identified and traffic re-routed along shorter paths.</t>
