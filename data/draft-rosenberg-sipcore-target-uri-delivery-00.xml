      <t>When a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) proxy receives a requesttargeted at a URI identifying a user or resource it is responsiblefor, the proxy translates the URI to a configured URI, or to aregistered contact URI, of an agent representing that user orresource. In the process, the original URI is removed from therequest. Numerous use cases have arisen which require thisinformation to be delivered to the user agent. This documentdescribes these use cases and defines an extension to the History-Info header field which allows it to be used to support those cases.</t>
