      <t>This Internet Calendar Access Protocol (ICAP) allows a client toaccess, manipulate and store Calendar information on a server. ICAPemploys the iCalendar format [ICAL] for interchange of calendaringinformation. ICAP includes operations for creating Calendar stores on a server,opening them and retrieving information about them. When aCalendar Store has been opened, it can be bounded by start and endtimes so that the client can act on a smaller subset of Calendarinformation for more efficient operation. ICAP allows users to storenew Calendar Objects into their own Calendar store and Calendarstores owned by other users with a single operation. ICAP supports searching iCalendar objects within a Calendar Store.Searches can be based on any iCalendar property and filtered byiCalendar Component type.</t>
