      <t>This Internet Calendar Access Protocol (ICAP) allows a client to access, manipulate and store Calendar information on a server. ICAP employs the iCalendar format [ICAL] for interchange of calendaring information. ICAP includes operations for creating Calendar stores on a server, opening them and retrieving information about them. When a Calendar Store has been opened, it can be bounded by start and end times so that the client can act on a smaller subset of Calendar information for more efficient operation. ICAP allows users to store new Calendar Objects into their own Calendar store and Calendar stores owned by other users with a single operation. ICAP supports searching iCalendar objects within a Calendar Store. Searches can be based on any iCalendar property and filtered by iCalendar Component type.</t>
