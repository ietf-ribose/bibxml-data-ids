    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a schema for the Domain Name System (DNS). This schema makes it possible to integrate DNS servers with an LDAP-based directory service, allowing an organization to maintain a single store of DNS information. Integration of DNS into LDAP directories is desirable since it reduces administrative overhead and eliminates the need to maintain multiple server centric configuration databases for DNS and other services. It is anticipated that this schema will be useful for providing a standardized format for the representation of attributes needed by DNS implementations within LDAP-based directory services.</t>
