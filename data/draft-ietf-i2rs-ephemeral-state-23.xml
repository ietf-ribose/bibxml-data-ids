      <t>"An Architecture for the Interface to the Routing System" (RFC 7921) abstractly describes a number of requirements for ephemeral state (in terms of capabilities and behaviors) that any protocol suite attempting to meet the needs of the Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) protocol has to provide. This document describes, in detail, requirements for ephemeral state for those implementing the I2RS protocol.</t>
