    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the GMA (Generic Multi-Access) traffic splitting control algorithm. The receiving endpoint measures one- way-delay, round-trip time, and delivery rate for multiple connections and determines how a data flow is split across them. When update is needed, it will send out a control message, aka Traffic Splitting Update (TSU), to notify the transmitting endpoint of the new traffic splitting configuration. Compared to other sender-based multi-path transport protocols, e.g. MPTCP, MPQUIC, the GMA traffic splitting algorithm is receiver-based and does not require per-packet feedback, e.g. Ack. It is designed specifically to support the Generic Multi-Access (GMA) convergence protocol as introduced in [MAMS] [GMA]. The solution has been developed by the authors based on their experiences in multiple standards bodies including IETF and 3GPP, is not an Internet Standard and does not represent the consensus opinion of the IETF.</t>
