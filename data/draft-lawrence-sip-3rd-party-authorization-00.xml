      <t>This draft describes some circumstances that are common in SIP deployments which lack a rigorous authorization model, and points out some ways in which this has resulted in poor security characteristics. The purpose of this document is to stimulate discussion of the identified problem and proposed requirements for any solution. Comments are solicited, and should be directed to the DISPATCH working group list at 'dispatch@ietf.org'.</t>
