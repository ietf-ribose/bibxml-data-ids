      <t>Currently there is nothing in a certificate to tell a relying party where this certificate, or any other certificate issued to the subject of this certificate, has been published. This document defines an extension that indicates where certificates of the subject may be published. Please send comments on this document to the ietf-pkix@imc.org mailing list.</t>
