      <t>This memo examines practical problems in the use of the ICANN generic top-level domains, in particular that they fail to provide a stable namespace that is required by some protocols. The practical problems are traced to underlying problems in domain name allocation policy in those domains. Possible solutions to the problem are discussed, including the possibility of a new top-level domain to be managed in accordance with IANA assigned-numbers principles.</t>
