      <t>This memo examines practical problems in the use of the ICANN generictop-level domains, in particular that they fail to provide a stablenamespace that is required by some protocols. The practical problemsare traced to underlying problems in domain name allocation policy inthose domains. Possible solutions to the problem are discussed,including the possibility of a new top-level domain to be managed inaccordance with IANA assigned-numbers principles.</t>
