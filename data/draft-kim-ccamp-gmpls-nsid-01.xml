      <t>This document presents a set of requirements of the Network State Information Database (NSID) for Traffic Engineering over Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) in the view of service providers. The Network State Information Database is required to implement the network architecture for network models that introduce the control element of IP and to optimize the utilization of network resources. And this document includes discussion about the considerations and necessity of the several attributes to construct NSID for Traffic Engineering over GMPLS that are extended from the requirement for Traffic Engineering over MPLS [4]. These attributes can be used to maximize the utilization of network resources and to enhance resource oriented Traffic Engineering techniques.</t>
