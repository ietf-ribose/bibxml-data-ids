      <t>The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework is widely used to provide clients with delegated access to user data. However, the core specification, The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework, leaves the definition of access scopes to individual service providers. This has led to a fragmented ecosystem for common groupware services (Mail, Calendaring, Contacts), where each provider uses proprietary, non-interoperable scope identifiers. Client applications, such as desktop mail clients, are forced to hardcode configurations for a small number of large providers, stifling innovation and harming open ecosystems. This document proposes a standardized set of scope values, using the IETF-controlled URN namespace, to represent granular and aggregate permissions for common mail (IMAP/POP/SMTP/JMAP), calendar (CalDAV), and contact (CardDAV) operations. Adopting these standard scopes would significantly improve interoperability between clients and servers, enabling automatic client configuration and a more seamless user experience.</t>
