      <t>This document defines the watcher information template-package for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event framework. Watcher information refers to the set of users subscribed to a particular resource within a particular event package. Watcher information changes dynamically as users subscribe, unsubscribe, are approved, or are rejected. A user can subscribe to this information, and therefore learn about changes to it. This event package is a template-package because it can be applied to any event package, including itself. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
