      <t>RFC 2748 [COPS] defines the COPS protocol, and RFC 2749 [COPS-RSVP] describes how the COPS protocol is used to provide for the outsourcing of policy decisions for RSVP. Another usage of the COPS protocol, for the provisioning of policy, is introduced in [COPS-PR]. In this provisioning model, the policy information is viewed as a collection of Policy Rule Classes and Policy Rule Instances residing in a virtual information store, termed the Policy Information Base (PIB). Collections of related Policy Rule Classes are defined in a PIB module. PIB modules are written using an adapted subset of SNMP's Structure of Management Information (SMI) [SMI, TC, CONF]. It is the purpose of this document, the Structure of Policy Provisioning Information (SPPI), to define that adapted subset.</t>
