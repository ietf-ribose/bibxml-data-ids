      <t>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN service to support some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements. VPN+ requires integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and the characteristics provided the underlay network. A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual underlay network which has a customized network topology and a set of network resources allocated from the physical network. A VTN could be used as the underlay for one or a group of VPN+ services. In some network scenarios, each VTN can be associated with a unique Flex-Algo Identifier. This document describes a mechanism to build the SR based VTNs using SR Flex-Algo and IGP L2 bundle with minor extensions.</t>
