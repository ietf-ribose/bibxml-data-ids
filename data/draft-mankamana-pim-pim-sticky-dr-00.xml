    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes a mechanism to enhance the stability of Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) Designated Router (DR) election by introducing the concept of a Sticky DR. In traditional PIM operations, the DR role on a LAN may change dynamically in response to router availability or priority changes, leading to potential multicast service disruptions or state reinitialization. The Sticky PIM DR approach aims to retain the previous DR role whenever feasible. By minimizing DR churn, this mechanism improves multicast session continuity, reduces unnecessary Join/Prune message propagation, and enhances operational stability in dense multicast deployments. The draft outlines the procedural extensions to existing PIM DR election, compatibility considerations, and configuration guidelines to support backward interoperability.</t>
