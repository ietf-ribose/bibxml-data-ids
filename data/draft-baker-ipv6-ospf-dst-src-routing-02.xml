      <t>This note describes the changes necessary for OSPFv3 to route classes of IPv6 traffic that are defined by an IPv6 source prefix and a destination prefix. This implies not simply routing "to a destination", but "traffic going to that destination AND coming from a specified source". It may be combined with other qualifying attributes, such as "traffic going to that destination AND using a specified flow label AND from a specified source prefix". The obvious application is egress routing, as required for a multihomed entity with a provider-allocated prefix from each of several upstream networks. Traffic within the network could be source/destination routed as well, or could be routed from "any prefix",::/0. If traffic is routed from the relevant PA prefixes but in fact has a source address that is in none of them, the traffic in effect has no route.</t>
