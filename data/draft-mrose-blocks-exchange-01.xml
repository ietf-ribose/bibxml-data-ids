      <t>Blocks[1] is an architecture for managing metadata. The architecture supports two models: the Blocks exchange model organizes information into navigation spaces, whilst the Blocks convergence model allows for bulk synchronization and knowledge management. This memo describes the Simple Exchange Profile (SEP) used to exchange objects, termed blocks, residing in an SEP datastore.
