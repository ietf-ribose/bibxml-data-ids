      <t>Virtualization technology has been widely supported by both Network Operators and Data Center providers to provide service with reduced operational and capital costs, automated deployment, and enhanced elasticity. A challenge is how to achieve the reliability and high availability capabilities of the virtualized network function to facilitate reliable service. This document focuses on the problems related to the reliability and high availability aspects of virtualized network function. A discussion of reliable virtualized network function pools is presented for scoping solution purpose. Some related works together with potential reuse and extension are also introduced.</t>
