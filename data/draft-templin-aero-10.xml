    <abstract>
      <t>Nodes attached to common multi-access link types (e.g., multicast- capable, shared media, non-broadcast multiple access (NBMA), etc.) can exchange packets as neighbors on the link, but may not always be provisioned with sufficient routing information for optimal neighbor selection. Such nodes should therefore be able to discover a trusted intermediate router on the link that provides both forwarding services to reach off-link destinations and redirection services to inform the node of an on-link neighbor that is closer to the final destination. This redirection can provide a useful route optimization, since the triangular path from the ingress link neighbor, to the intermediate router, and finally to the egress link neighbor may be considerably longer than the direct path from ingress to egress. However, ordinary redirection may lead to operational issues on certain link types and/or in certain deployment scenarios. This document therefore introduces an Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO) capability that addresses the issues.</t>
