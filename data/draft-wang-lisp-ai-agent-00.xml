    <abstract>
      <t>The emergence of distributed artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly those composed of autonomous agents operating across cloud, edge, and endpoint environments, introduces new networking requirements. These include location transparency, seamless mobility, multi-homing, and logical isolation at scale. This document explores how the Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) can serve as a robust network substrate to meet these requirements. The document outlines use cases, design considerations, and minimal extensions to the existing LISP framework to support context-aware mapping and AI agent-centric communication.</t>
