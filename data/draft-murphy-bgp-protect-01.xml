      <t>BGP, along with a host of other infrastructure protocols designed before the Internet environment became perilous, is designed with little consideration for protection of the information it carries. There are no mechanisms in BGP to protect against attacks that modify, delete, forge, or replay data, any of which has the potential to disrupt overall network routing behavior. This internet draft discusses some of the security issues with BGP routing data dissemination, and possible security solutions and the costs of those solutions. This internet draft does not discuss security issues with forwarding of packets.</t>
