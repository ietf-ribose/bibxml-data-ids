      <t>BGP, along with a host of other infrastructure protocols designed beforethe Internet environment became perilous, is designed with littleconsideration for protection of the information it carries. There areno mechanisms in BGP to protect against attacks that modify, delete,forge, or replay data, any of which has the potential to disrupt overallnetwork routing behavior.This internet draft discusses some of the security issues with BGProuting data dissemination, and possible security solutions and thecosts of those solutions. This internet draft does not discuss securityissues with forwarding of packets.</t>
