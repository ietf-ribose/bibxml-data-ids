      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) was designed to supportestablishment and maintenance of end-to-end sessions. Proxy serversprovide call routing, authentication and authorization, mobility, andother signaling services that are independent of the session.Effectively, proxies provide signaling policy enforcement. However,numerous scenarios have arisen which require the involvement ofproxies in some aspect of the session policy. SIP has no support forsuch capabilities, as the community has generally consideringinvolvement of proxies in session details 'evil'. Practicalimplementations have therefore resorted to non-standard manipulationof SDP messages in order to enforce session policy. Theseimplementations are fragile and frought with problems. In thisdocument, we discuss a middle-ground approach which permits proxieslimited involvement in session policy, but retains the robustnessthat derives from the current prohibition on SDP manipulation.</t>
