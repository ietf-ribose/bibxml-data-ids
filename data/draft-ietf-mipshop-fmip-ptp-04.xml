      <t>Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers specification currently does not explicitly define prefix management over point-to-point links when a mobile node uses a prefix to formulate a new care-of-address. In this document a mechanism is developed for a previous access router to request unique prefixes from a new access router, and in turn, the previous access router advertises the prefixes to the mobile node for a new care-of-address configuration. Extensions to Mobile IPv6 Fast Handovers specification are also specified in this document.</t>
