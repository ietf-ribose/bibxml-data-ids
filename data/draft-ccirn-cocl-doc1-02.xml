      <t>The OSI transport service may be realized through a variety of transport/network protocol combinations. Regrettably, few of the combinations actually interoperate with each other. As such, even if all OSI-capable end-systems enjoyed full-connectivity, they would not be able to uniformly interoperate. This memo examines the problem and proposes an approach in order to develop solutions to this problem.</t>
