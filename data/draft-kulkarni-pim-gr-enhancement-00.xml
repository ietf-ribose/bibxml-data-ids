      <t>This document suggests the GR enhancement for BSR, BIDIR and PIM-SM. -This draft suggests a mechanism to refresh E-BSR state and to learn RP-Set on Rebooted E-BSR Router quickly. -This draft suggests a mechanism for PIM-BIDIR Downstream Routers to refresh the (*, G) state only after 'Rebooted Upstream Router has learnt the RP Information and DF election is complete'. -This draft suggests a mechanism for PIM-SM Downstream Router to delay the (*, G) joins to allow RP Information to be learnt on Rebooted Upstream Router. It also suggests the mechanism to refresh the Assert-Winner or Assert-Loser state on Rebooting Router.</t>
