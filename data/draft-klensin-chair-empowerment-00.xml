      <t>From time to time, there have been complaints about internalconflicts within the IESG that have retarded projects. Some IETFChairs have expressed frustration about not being able to resolve theproblems and several members of the community have expressedfrustration that the Chairs cannot do so. The recall process has notbeen effective in either dealing with or deterring these problems.This document proposes, as a process experiment, an alternate modelwhose intent is to give the Chair some leverage on solving any suchproblems that may arise in the future.</t>
