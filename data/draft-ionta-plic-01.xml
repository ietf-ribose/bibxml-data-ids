      <t>This document describes an innovative frame, called PLIC,("PerformanceLayer Inboard Computing") able to support active, passive or hybridperformance measurements on any kind of unicast and multicast servicepassing through a network. It is based on an algorithm which, througha distributed computation, floods the performance measurements of eachnode to the rest of the network, without necessity of any externaltopology database or operation support system. It has been inventedand engineered in the Telecom Italia Core Network.</t>
