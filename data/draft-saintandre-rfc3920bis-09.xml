XMPP provides a generalized, extensibleframework for incrementally exchanging XML data, upon which a varietyof applications can be built. The framework includes methods forstream setup and teardown, channel encryption, authentication of aclient to a server and of one server to another server, andprimitives for push-style messages, publication of networkavailability information ("presence"), and request-responseinteractions. This document also specifies the format for XMPPaddresses, which are fully internationalizable.This document obsoletes RFC 3920.</t>
