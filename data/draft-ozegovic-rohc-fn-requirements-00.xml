      <t>This draft describes requirements expected to be achieved with profile formal notation system for ROHC.The RObust Header Compression (ROHC) [1] scheme is designed to compress packet headers over error prone channels. It is built around an extensible core framework that can be tailored to compress new protocol stacks by adding additional ROHC profiles.The role of formal notation is to provide a simple method for ROHCprofile specification. It is to be used in the phase of profilerefinement to achieve maximal compression ratio possible, as well as in the phase of software implementation to provide unambiguousprofile specification.</t>
