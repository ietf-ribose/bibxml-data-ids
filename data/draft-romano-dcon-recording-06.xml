      <t>This document deals with session recording, specifically for what concerns recording of multimedia conferences, both centralized and distributed. Each involved media is recorded separately, and is then properly tagged. A SMIL [W3C.CR-SMIL3-20080115] metadata is used to put all the separate recordings together and handle their synchronization, as well as the possibly asynchronous opening and closure of media within the context of a conference. This SMIL metadata can subsequently be used by an interested user by means of a compliant player in order to passively receive a playout of the whole multimedia conference session. The motivation for this document comes from our experience with our conferencing framework, Meetecho, for which we implemented a recording functionality.</t>
