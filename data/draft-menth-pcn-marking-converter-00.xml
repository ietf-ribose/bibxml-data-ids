      <t>This document proposes an algorithm that converts packet markings of a stream that was excess-marked based on a lower-rate into packet markings that correspond to a stream that was excess-marked based on a higher-rate. It may be applied in the PCN context to convert marked admissible-rate-overload into marked supportable-rate- overload. This allows to perform marked flow termination when packets are excess-marked based on the admissible rate only.</t>
