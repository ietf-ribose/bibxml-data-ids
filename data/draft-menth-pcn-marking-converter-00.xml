      <t>This document proposes an algorithm that converts packet markings ofa stream that was excess-marked based on a lower-rate into packetmarkings that correspond to a stream that was excess-marked based ona higher-rate. It may be applied in the PCN context to convertmarked admissible-rate-overload into marked supportable-rate-overload. This allows to perform marked flow termination whenpackets are excess-marked based on the admissible rate only.</t>
