      <t>This specification provides a way to save the meta data about each MoQ Object in one or more files as well as pointers to other files that contain the contents of the object. Separating of the meta data and payload data allow the payload data to remain in files that are used for other purposes such as serving HLS/DASH video. This format makes it easier to test and develop caching relays and create test data they can serve to client.</t>
