      <t>It is difficult to supervise the great deal of Internet of Things (IoT) smart terminals which are widely distributed. Furthermore, a large number of smart terminals (such as IP cameras, access control terminals, traffic cameras, etc.) running on the network have high security risks in access control. This draft introduces the technical requirements for access management and control of IoT smart terminals, which is used to solve the problem of personate and illegal connection in the access process, and enables users to strengthen the control of devices and discover devices that is offline in time, so as to ensure the safety and stability of smart terminals in the access process.</t>
