    <abstract>
      <t>In the past several years, work on QoS enabled networks led to the development of the Integrated Services (Intserv) architecture [12] and the RSVP signaling protocol [1]. RSVP addresses the needs of applications that require QoS, promising per-flow service. As the RSVP/Intserv (from here on abbreviated to intserv) work has proceeded, we have recognized barriers to the deployment of intserv. The reliance of intserv on per-flow state and per-flow processing is an impediment to its deployment in the Internet at large, and in particular in large carrier networks. Additionally, RSVP signaling is supposed to originate from hosts, which as of yet are not RSVP enabled in large numbers. Recently, attention has shifted to Differentiated services (diff-serv). Diff-serv promises to expedite the realization of QoS enabled networks by offering a significantly simpler alternative to intserv, which eliminates scalability concerns and which can be implemented and managed in large networks, without requiring end-to-end deployment. However, unlike intserv, diff-serv focuses on the needs of the large network. This draft proposes a framework for end-to-end QoS, in which intserv and diff-serv are used together to meet the needs of large ISPs who manage the transit networks of the Internet, and the users of QoS applications and hosts, who are the ISPs' ultimate customers. This focus is important as we believe that in the coming years, there will be a proliferation of applications that depend on QoS and of hosts which are capable of QoS signaling. We envision the deployment of diff-serv capable core networks and intserv capable stub networks at the periphery. Our framework allows each to proceed at its own pace, providing immediate incremental benefits in areas of the network in which one or the other is deployed and additional benefits where both are deployed.</t>
