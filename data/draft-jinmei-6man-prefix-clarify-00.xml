      <t>The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and Stateless Address Autoconfiguration protocols intentionally separate the handling of prefixes for their purposes: these prefixes can be different for the same link even if it may be uncommon in practice; validation for these purposes is expected to be performed separately and independently. Despite the revised text of the latest versions of these protocol specifications, it appears that the idea of this separation can still be easily misunderstood. This document clarifies the idea even more explicitly in order to set the common understanding of the intent of the current specifications.</t>
