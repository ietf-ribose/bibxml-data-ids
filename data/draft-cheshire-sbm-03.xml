      <t>In the past decade there has been growing awareness about the harmful effects of bufferbloat in the network, and there has been good work on developments like L4S to address that problem. However, bufferbloat on the sender itself remains a significant additional problem, which has not received similar attention. This document offers techniques and guidance for host networking software to avoid network traffic suffering unnecessary delays caused by excessive buffering at the sender. These improvements are broadly applicable across all datagram and transport protocols (UDP, TCP, QUIC, etc.) on all operating systems.</t>
