      <t>The ASCII-text file format of Request for Comments (RFC) documentswas devised decades ago when the authoring tools were line editorslike vi and text processors like nroff. The format still has greatutility because it meets the constraints of many kinds of printingand display equipment, but it is difficult to produce with some oftoday's desktop publishing tools. This paper describes the RFC textfile format and discusses its fine points; this should be useful toauthors of RFCs and Internet Drafts regardless of their tools. Thispaper also describes the UGLI method, a hybrid method for producingRFCs by using modern software for composition and editing and usingolder software, applied in 'cookbook' fashion, to finish the job. Themethod is described in terms of Microsoft Word on an Apple Macintoshbut is easily adaptable for other word processors on other platforms.</t>
