      <t>The ASCII-text file format of Request for Comments (RFC) documents was devised decades ago when the authoring tools were line editors like vi and text processors like nroff. The format still has great utility because it meets the constraints of many kinds of printing and display equipment, but it is difficult to produce with some of today's desktop publishing tools. This paper describes the RFC text file format and discusses its fine points; this should be useful to authors of RFCs and Internet Drafts regardless of their tools. This paper also describes the UGLI method, a hybrid method for producing RFCs by using modern software for composition and editing and using older software, applied in 'cookbook' fashion, to finish the job. The method is described in terms of Microsoft Word on an Apple Macintosh but is easily adaptable for other word processors on other platforms.</t>
