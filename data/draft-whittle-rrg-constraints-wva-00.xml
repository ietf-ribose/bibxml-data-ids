      <t>This ID will contain a version of my attempt to list the constraintsthe RRG faces in choosing a scalable routing solution due to the needfor widespread voluntary adoption. This ID is to support anddocument the IRTF Routing Research Group discussions concerningscalable routing, in early 2010. It is not a formal product of theRRG. To what extent its contents are supported by RRG consensus canonly be determined by the co-chairs.</t>
