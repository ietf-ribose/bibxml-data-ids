      <t>The IETF's RAP Working Group has almost completed its task of defining COPS as a standards-track protocol for RSVP Admission Policy. The WG's charter is now being extended to cover standardizing a policy provisioning protocol, and the proposal put forward for consideration by the WG is based on defining a new Client-type for COPS. This new Client-type is intended to work in conjunction with the QoS Policy objects and schema definitions being defined in two other IETF Working Groups: Differentiated Services, and Policy. Before proceeding any further, it has been requested that a comparison be undertaken as to why COPS is better suited to this than a (modified if necessary) version of SNMP. This memo attempts to document such a comparison.</t>
