      <t>The IETF's RAP Working Group has almost completed its task of definingCOPS as a standards-track protocol for RSVP Admission Policy. TheWG's charter is now being extended to cover standardizing a policyprovisioning protocol, and the proposal put forward for considerationby the WG is based on defining a new Client-type for COPS. This newClient-type is intended to work in conjunction with the QoS Policyobjects and schema definitions being defined in two other IETF WorkingGroups: Differentiated Services, and Policy. Before proceeding anyfurther, it has been requested that a comparison be undertaken as towhy COPS is better suited to this than a (modified if necessary)version of SNMP. This memo attempts to document such a comparison.</t>
