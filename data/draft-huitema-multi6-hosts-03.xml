      <t>A way to solve the issue of site multihoming is to have a separatesite prefix for each connection of the site, and to derive as manyaddresses for each hosts. This approach to multi-homing, which wecall Host-Centric IPv6 Multihoming, has the advantage of minimalimpact on the inter-domain routing fabric, since each site prefix canbe aggregated within the larger prefix of a specific provider;however, it opens a number of issues, which we will discuss in thismemo, including the problem created by the interaction betweeningress filtering and multihoming, which we analyze in detail. Wethen propose a set of specific solutions that enable host centricmultihoming, and we review how these solutions meet the requirementsof IPv6 site multihoming.</t>
