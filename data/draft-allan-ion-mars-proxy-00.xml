      <t>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] has been proposed as an accessvehicle for public ATM networks. Support for multicast in thisenvironment via either RAS replication, or a adding MARS client side byside with PPP is problematic on several fronts. This document describes how an ATM attached system can act as a MARSproxy on behalf of a PPP client. This solution circumvents many of theassociated problems with respect to VC frugality, scalability, andauthentication.</t>
