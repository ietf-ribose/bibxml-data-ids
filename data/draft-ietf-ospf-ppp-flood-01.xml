      <t>The OSPF routing protocol synchronizes its link-state database over all links. However, when multiple point-to-point links connect a pair of OSPF routers, it is only necessary to flood over one of the parallel links. This can be done in a backward-compatible fashion, without requiring negotiation between neighboring routers, as described in this memo.</t>
