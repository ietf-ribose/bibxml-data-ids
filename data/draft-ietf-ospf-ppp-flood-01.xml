      <t>The OSPF routing protocol synchronizes its link-state database overall links. However, when multiple point-to-point links connect apair of OSPF routers, it is only necessary to flood over one of theparallel links. This can be done in a backward-compatible fashion,without requiring negotiation between neighboring routers, asdescribed in this memo.</t>
