    <abstract>
      <t>As the Internet of Things (IoT) systems are becoming more pervasive with their rapid adoption, they are also becoming more complex in their architecture. Hence, a tool is required to generate prototype code based on the YANG models for constrained devices [RFC7228] to improve interoperability and increase the reusability of software components. A novel approach is introduced in this document to generate software prototypes (also called stubs) in the C language for the CORECONF protocol [I-D.ietf-core-comi] using YANG Schema Item iDentifiers (YANG SID [I-D.ietf-core-sid]). These stubs greatly reduce the complexity of navigating the CORECONF structure by abstracting the corresponding YANG SIDs. This document elaborates on the procedure to generate YANG SIDs for a given YANG model of a system, which then generates C stubs using the tools developed by the authors with the help of an example (sensor.yang file).</t>
