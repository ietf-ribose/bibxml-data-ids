      <t>This document proposes an extension to the Mobile IP base protocol (RFC 2002) to allow Mobile Nodes (Hosts) and Mobility Agents (both home network and foreign network) to use X.509 digital certificates, public keys and digital signatures as the basis of authenticating Mobile IP control messages in addition to secret key authentication. The use of these mechanisms will allow Mobile IP to scale from small research environments to potentially millions of mobile nodes across thousands of networks owned-operated by different organizations and service providers. A Public Key Infrastructure is proposed that focuses specifically on authentication of Mobile IP knowledgeable nodes, NOT general use for authenticating individuals.</t>
