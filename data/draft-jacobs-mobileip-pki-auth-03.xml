      <t>This document proposes an extension to the Mobile IP base protocol(RFC 2002) to allow Mobile Nodes (Hosts) and Mobility Agents (bothhome network and foreign network) to use X.509 digital certificates,public keys and digital signatures as the basis of authenticatingMobile IP control messages in addition to secret key authentication.The use of these mechanisms will allow Mobile IP to scale from smallresearch environments to potentially millions of mobile nodes acrossthousands of networks owned-operated by different organizations andservice providers. A Public Key Infrastructure is proposed thatfocuses specifically on authentication of Mobile IP knowledgeablenodes, NOT general use for authenticating individuals.</t>
