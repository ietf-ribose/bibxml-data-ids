      <t>Encryption and other security mechanisms are on the rise on all layers of the stack, protecting user data and making network operations more secured. Further, encryption is also a tool to address ossification that has been observed on various layers of the stack over time. Separation of functions into layers and enforcement of layer boundaries based on encryption supports selected exposure to those entities that are addressed by a function on a certain layer. A clear separation supports innovation and also enables new opportunities for collaborative functions. RFC 8558 describes path signals as messages to or from on-path elements. This document states principles for designing mechanisms that use or provide path signals and calls for actions on specific valuable cases.</t>
