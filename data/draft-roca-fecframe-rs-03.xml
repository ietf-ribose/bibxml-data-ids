      <t>This document describes two fully-specified simple FEC schemes for Reed-Solomon codes that can be used to protect media streams along the lines defined by the FECFRAME framework. Reed-Solomon codes belong to the class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes which means they offer optimal protection against packet erasures. They are also systematic codes, which means that the source symbols are part of the encoding symbols. The price to pay is a limit on the maximum source block size, on the maximum number of encoding symbols, and a computational complexity higher than that of LDPC codes for instance. The first scheme is for Reed-Solomon codes over GF(2^^m), with 2 &lt;= m &lt;= 16 and arbitrary packet flows. The second scheme is similar to the first scheme, with the exception that it is restricted to a single sequenced flow.</t>
