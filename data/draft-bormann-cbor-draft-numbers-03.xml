    <abstract>
      <t>CBOR-based protocols often make use of numbers allocated in a registry. During development of the protocols, those numbers may not yet be available. This impedes the generation of data models and examples that actually can be used by tools. This short draft proposes a common way to handle these situations, without any changes to existing tools. Also, in conjunction with the application-oriented EDN literal "e", a further reduction in editorial processing of CBOR examples around the time of approval can be achieved.</t>
