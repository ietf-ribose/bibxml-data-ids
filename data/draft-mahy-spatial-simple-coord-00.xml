      <t>The Spatial Working Group is creating a Spatial Location Protocol (SLoP) [2] for requesting the spatial location of a target user or device. SLoP is designed to carry other formats that contain the spatial location. In many cases either the SLoP client and/or server could be a small mobile device with limited processing, memory, storage, and battery life. This proposal is a simple, text- based format to carry latitude, longitude, altitude, time, and accuracy.</t>
