    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents an architecture for a distributed DNSSEC multi-signer model that most closely resembles "model 2" in [RFC8901]. It defines two multi-signer specific entities: the "multi-signer agent" (MSA) that is responsible for the multi-signer process and the "combiner", which is responsible for "combining" unsigned zone data from the zone owner with zone data under control of the MSA. It introduces a new DNS RRtype, HSYNC, that is used by the zone owner to designate the chosen DNS Providers (signing and/or serving the zone). Furthermore it describes a mechanism for the MSAs to establish secure communication with each other, either via “pure DNS” communication secured by DNS SIG(0) signatures on each message or via a RESTful API secured by TLS. Finally, the document describes two models for multi-signer process synchronization: “leader/follower mode” and “peer mode” and the mechanism by which a set of MSAs decide which model to use for a given zone. The scope of the document is only the distributed aspect of DNSSEC multi-signer up to the point where secure communication and synchronization method between MSAs has been established. The “multi-signer algorithms” that deal with the actual synchronization required for multi-signer operation are described in [I-D.draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-automation].
