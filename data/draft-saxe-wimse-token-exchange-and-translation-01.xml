    <abstract>
      <t>The specification defines the processes of token exchange and token translation for workloads. Token exchange is introduced in [RFC8693], allowing the exchange of access tokens, OpenID Connect ID Tokens, and SAML assertions for new OAuth access tokens. However, for workloads, there exist a broad array of input and output token types which must be considered beyond the input types supported by [RFC8693]. These token types include, but are not limited to, SPIFFE SVIDs, x.509 certificates, Kerberos service tickets, Amazon sigv4A, macaroons, &lt;...&gt;. Further, these tokens may be encoded in formats including JWT OAuth 2.0 Acesss Tokens [RFC9068], CWT [RFC8392], and protocol buffers (protobufs). Given the variety and complexity of input and output token types and encoding, a strict token exchange that maintains all of the contextual information from the input token to the output token may not be possible. We define these non-RFC8693 use cases with potentially lossy conversions as "token translation" (e.g. information may be lost in translation). In this document we describe a workload profile for token exchange, using the mechanisms in [RFC8693], and a new set of translations between arbitrary token types. Additionally, we define mechanisms to enrich tokens during translation to support the use cases defined in (todo: add link to use cases doc).</t>
