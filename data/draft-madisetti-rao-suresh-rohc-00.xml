      <t>Enhanced Compressed RTP (ECRTP) and Robust Header Compression (ROHC) are IP header compression schemes that have been proposed for use in wireless applications, primarily for voice and audio applications. While ROHC offers a high degree of compression and is robust, it is also computationally expensive. On the other hand, ECRTP does not achieve as high a compression, while being less expensive computationally. Our porposal, E2CRTP, is an enhanced version of ECRTP that offers a middleground between the ROHC and ECRTP, providing robustness, compression efficiency, and moderate computational complexity.</t>
