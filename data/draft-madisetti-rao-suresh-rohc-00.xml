      <t>Enhanced Compressed RTP (ECRTP) and Robust Header Compression(ROHC) are IP header compression schemes that have been proposed for use in wireless applications, primarily forvoice and audio applications. While ROHC offers a highdegree of compression and is robust, it is also computationallyexpensive. On the other hand, ECRTP does not achieve as higha compression, while being less expensive computationally. Our porposal, E2CRTP, is an enhanced version of ECRTP thatoffers a middleground between the ROHC and ECRTP, providingrobustness, compression efficiency, and moderate computationalcomplexity.</t>
