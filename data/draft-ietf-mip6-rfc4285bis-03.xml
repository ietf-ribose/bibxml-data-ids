      <t>IPsec is specified as the means of securing signaling messages between the Mobile Node and Home Agent for Mobile IPv6. Mobile IPv6 signalling messages that are secured include the Binding Updates and Acknowledgement messages used for managing the bindings between a Mobile Node and its Home Agent. This document proposes an alternate method for securing Mobile IPv6 signaling messages between a Mobile Nodes and Home Agents. The alternate method defined here consists of a Mobile IPv6 specific authentication option that can be added to Mobile IPv6 signalling messages.</t>
