      <t>This memo proposes a simple metric to determine if a network has maintained packet sequence. It provides motivations for the new metric, suggests a metric definition, and discusses the issues associated with measuring packet sequence. The memo includes secondary metrics to quantify the extent of reordering in several useful dimensions. Some examples of evaluation using the non- reversing sequence criterion are included.</t>
