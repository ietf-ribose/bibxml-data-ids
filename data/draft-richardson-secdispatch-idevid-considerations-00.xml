      <t>This document provides a number of operational modes that a manufacturer of devices that include IEEE 802.1AR IDevID certificates may choose from. Different ways of generating and signing the needed keypairs are detailed, and the security tradeoffs of each method are considered. This document provides a nomenclature for each mode. IDevID certificates are used in ANIMA's BRSKI Manufacturer Authorized Signing Authority (MASA) process.</t>
