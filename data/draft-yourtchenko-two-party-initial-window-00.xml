      <t>There are several proposals on increasing the TCP initial congestionwindow to a new hardcoded value and subsequent updates of thishardcoded value. This document explores the mechanism of dynamicallydetermining the potentially unbounded Initial Window. This wouldallow for the future growth after only one software upgrade of theexisting TCP stacks. Also this would allow automatic adjustment ofthe Initial Window size depending on the connectivity properties ofthe particular Internet host, while minimizing the retransmissionsthat result from overly optimistic initial congestion windowselection.</t>
