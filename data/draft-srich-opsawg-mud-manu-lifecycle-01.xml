      <t>Manufacturer Usage Descriptions, or MUDs, allow a manufacturer to cheaply and simply describe to the network the accesses required by an IoT device without adding any extra cost or software to the devices themselves. By doing so, the network infrastructure devices can apply access policies automatically which increase the overall security of the entire network, not just for the IoT devices themselves.
