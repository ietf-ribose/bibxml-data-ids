      <t>Application-aware Networking (APN) aims to convey Application-aware Information (APN attribute) including APN ID and APN parameters indicating application group-level and user group-level requirements along with the data packets into the network and enable the network to provide corresponding fine-granular network services. There have been challenges of the privacy and security issues that could potentially be introduced by conveying the APN attribute into the network. This document describes the security and privacy considerations of APN in various possible scenarios wherein APN will be deployed.</t>
