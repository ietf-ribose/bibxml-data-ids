      <t>There is a great challenge in cabling deployment for an enterprise- scale data center. An error in wire-connection between switches could lead to a reduction in network throughout or unreachable for some routers within network in an even worse case. In addition, it is also a tough task to find and repair the error connection among numerous wires. A method to address this error in switch connection would save a great amount of time and cost in modern data center construction. Here, this draft introduces an approach for auto-assignment of IP addresses for wired switches, which allows data to be transmitted via a cable that is connecting two arbitrary interfaces from two switches.</t>
