      <t>Service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on the capability to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet loss. The common reasons for packet drop are Link Congestion, Device (Router/Switch/Firewall/etc.) Performance, Software issues (bugs) on a network device, Faulty Hardware or Cabling and Service Function processing errors. Packet Loss Measurement capability also provides operators with greater visibility into the performance characteristics of their networks, thereby facilitating planning, troubleshooting, and network performance evaluation. This document specifies best possible efficient and accurate mechanism for passive packet loss measurement for Service Function Chains (SFCs) for a SFC network domain.</t>
