      <t>This document describes a service concept implementation of a Dynamic Call Screening Service (DCS) made available to WAP endpoints. This work builds on an existing Internet Call Waiting (ICW) [1] platform to provide enhanced call screening and control capabilities via the WAP interface to wireless handsets. This extends the current ICW [1] service to provide a 'WAP Proxy' which supports call screening notification and automatic disposition capabilities. In this way the service evolves from an Internet Call Waiting service for wireline subscribers to a network-based user agent with which users can register to direct incoming call n otifications to any of several endpoint device types depending on their current preferences and availability.</t>
