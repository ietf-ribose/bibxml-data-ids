      <t>This document describes a service concept implementation of a Dynamic Call Screening Service (DCS) made available to WAP endpoints. Thiswork builds on an existing Internet Call Waiting (ICW) [1] platformto provide enhanced call screening and control capabilities via theWAP interface to wireless handsets. This extends the current ICW [1] service to provide a 'WAP Proxy' which supports call screeningnotification and automatic disposition capabilities. In this way the service evolves from an Internet Call Waiting service for wirelinesubscribers to a network-based user agent with which users canregister to direct incoming call n otifications to any of severalendpoint device types depending on their current preferences andavailability.</t>
