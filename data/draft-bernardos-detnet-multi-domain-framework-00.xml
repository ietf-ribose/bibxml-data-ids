    <abstract>
      <t>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides the capability to carry specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency over a path or network. As DetNet deployments expand, they will inevitably need to span multiple domains that may be under separate administrative or technological control. This creates a need for a control plane solution that can establish and maintain end-to-end DetNet services across these domain boundaries. This document defines a generic framework for a multi-domain DetNet control plane. It first establishes a working definition of a "DetNet Domain" for the purpose of path computation and control. It then describes two high-level architectural approaches for inter- domain path computation and resource reservation: a Hierarchical model and a peer-to-peer "stitching" model. While a Path Computation Element (PCE)-based realization is used as an illustrative example, the framework is designed to be applicable to any controller-plane technology that satisfies the stated functional requirements. This framework provides the foundation for more specific work on multi- domain DetNet solutions.</t>
