      <t>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are typically composed of resource constrained nodes communicating over links that have dynamic characteristics. Memory constraints coupled with temporal variations in link connectivity makes the use of topology maintenance to support IPv6 multicast challenging. This document describes the use of Trickle to efficiently forward multicast messages without the need for topology maintenance.</t>
