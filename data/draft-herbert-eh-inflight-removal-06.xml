    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a method to allow intermediate nodes to remove IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options headers and Routing headers from packets inflight. The goal is to reduce the probability of packets being dropped because they contain these extension headers without impacting functionality. An additional goal is to limit visibility of information in extension headers to those nodes that need to process the headers.</t>
