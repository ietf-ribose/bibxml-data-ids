    <abstract>
      <t>This document is an addendum to Version 1 of RSVP (Resource ReSerVation Protocol) as defined in the proposed standard [RFC2205]. The flow label, one of the new header fields of the IPv6 protocol, allows improvements to resource reservation protocols on IPv6 capable networks. Utilization of the flow label simplifies packet classification and optimizes packet processing in routers along the transport path. The main objectives of this document are to specify the proper usage of the IPv6 flow label and to promote its support within RSVP. This memo defines extensions required to the Version 1 specification and additional processing rules needed to ensure correct operation. Rather than simply presenting the specification with no justification, we have tried to present the benefits of adopting the flow label within RSVP for IPv6. This addendum does not have any effect on the implementation or usage of RSVP for IPv4.</t>
