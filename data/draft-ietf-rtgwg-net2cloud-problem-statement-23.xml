    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the network-related problems enterprises face at the moment of writing this specification when interconnecting their branch offices with dynamic workloads in third-party data centers (a.k.a. Cloud DCs) and some mitigation practices. There can be many problems associated with connecting to or among Cloud DCs; the Net2Cloud problem statements are mainly for enterprises that already have traditional VPN services and are interested in leveraging those networks (instead of altogether abandoning them). Other problems are out of the scope of this document. This document also describes the mitigation practices for getting around the identified problems.</t>
