      <t>The complexity of telecommunication networks, i.e. enterprise and carrier networks, has grown over the last two decades. Management of carrier networks and enterprise networks has followed different paradigms up to now: - In carrier networks the Telecommunications Management Network (TMN) as created by ITU-T in the early 1980s is still being propagated. - In enterprise networks the SNMP based approach is widely accepted. The borders between public (carrier) and private (enterprise) networks are becoming increasingly transparent, a distinction between both types of networks may soon be irrelevant from a network management point of view.</t>
