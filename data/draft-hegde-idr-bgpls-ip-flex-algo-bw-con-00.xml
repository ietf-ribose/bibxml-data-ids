    <abstract>
      <t>Flexible Algorithm is a mechanism that allows Link state routing protocols (viz. OSPF and IS-IS) to compute paths over a network based on user-defined (and hence, flexible) constraints and metrics. The computation is performed by routers participating in the specific network in a distributed manner using a Flexible Algorithm definition. This definition provisioned on one or more routers and propagated (viz. OSPF and IS- IS flooding) through the network. IP Flex-algo enables these constraint based paths to be built in a network which is purely IP and does not support MPLS or SRv6 forwarding plane. BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) enables the collection of various topology information from the network. This draft defines extensions to BGP- LS address-family to advertise bandwidth, delay and metric related constraints in Flexible algorithm definition. It also defines BGP-LS extensions required to advertise IP flexible algorithm related extensions in BGP-LS.</t>
