      <t>RSVP has been extended in several directions [Policy], [Identity], [DCLASS], [AggrRSVP], [DiffModel],[COPS-RSVP], These extensions have broadened the applicability of RSVP characterizing it as a signaling protocol usable outside the IntServ model. With the addition of the 'Null Service Type' [NullServ], RSVP is being adopted also by mission critical applications that require some form of prioritized service, but cannot readily specify their resource requirements. These applications do not need to set-up a reservation end-to-end, but only to signal to the network their policy information [Policy], [Identity] and obtain in response an applicable DSCP [DCLASS]. RSVP Receiver Proxy is an extension to the RSVP message processing (not to the protocol itself), mainly designed to operate in conjunction with the Null Service Type and with an extension of the COPS for RSVP protocol [COPS-RSVP-EXT].</t>
