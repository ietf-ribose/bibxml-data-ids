      <t>RSVP has been extended in several directions [Policy], [Identity],[DCLASS], [AggrRSVP], [DiffModel],[COPS-RSVP], These extensions havebroadened the applicability of RSVP characterizing it as a signalingprotocol usable outside the IntServ model.With the addition of the 'Null Service Type' [NullServ], RSVP isbeing adopted also by mission critical applications that require someform of prioritized service, but cannot readily specify theirresource requirements. These applications do not need to set-up areservation end-to-end, but only to signal to the network theirpolicy information [Policy], [Identity] and obtain in response anapplicable DSCP [DCLASS].RSVP Receiver Proxy is an extension to the RSVP message processing(not to the protocol itself), mainly designed to operate inconjunction with the Null Service Type and with an extension of theCOPS for RSVP protocol [COPS-RSVP-EXT].</t>
