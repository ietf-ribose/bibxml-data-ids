      <t>MPLS is being deployed deeper into operator networks, often to or past the access network node. Separately network access nodes such as Passive Optical Network (PON) Optical Line Terminations (OLTs) have evolved to support first-mile access protection, where one or more physical OLTs provide first-mile diversity to the customer edge. Multi-homing support is needed on the MPLS-enabled PON OLT to provide resiliency for provided services. This document describes the multi-chassis PON protection architecture in MPLS and also specifies the Inter-Chassis Communication Protocol (ICCP) extension to support it.</t>
