      <t>This memo provides clear definitions for Active and Passive performance assessment. The construction of Metrics and Methods can be described as Active or Passive. Some methods may use a subset of both active and passive attributes, and we refer to these as Hybrid Methods. This memo also describes multiple dimensions to help evaluate new methods as they emerge.</t>
