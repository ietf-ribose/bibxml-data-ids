      <t>The specific mechanism described in the current PMIPv6 draft tosupport multihoming is such that a unique prefix is given to eachinterface of a Mobile Node (MN) that is attached to the PMIPv6domain. However, multihoming can also be provided using same uniqueprefix for all interfaces of MN similar to the MONAMI6 (Mobile Nodesand Multiple Interfaces in IPv6) concept. This memo explores andhighlights lack of advanced multihoming support and other hand-offrelated issues where appropriate in three different mobilitymanagement protocol models for multiple interfaced mobile nodes.Firstly, when single prefix is allocated for all interfaces of MN inthe PMIPv6 domain. Secondly, when unique prefix is allocated foreach interface as in PMIPv6 standard protocol model. Thirdly, when amultiple interfaced node uses different mobility managementmechanisms for each of its interfaces.</t>
