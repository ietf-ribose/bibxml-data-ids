      <t>The continuous growth of routing tables in the core of Internet is achallenge. It would become overwhelming if each multihomed customersite would need a provider independent prefix to take full advantageof its multihoming. IPv6 has the potential to solve this problem,but a complete specification is still missing. This draft proposesan approach for a solution.The Stateless Address Mapping (SAM) model, introduced for this, isapplicable to a hierarchy of routing zones with multihoming permittedat each level, and with each zone using local addresses for itsinternal routing plan. End-to-end transparency of the Internet ismaintains across these local-address zones, thanks to a systematicencapsulation of global-address packets into local-address packets.Local addresses are statelessly derived from prefixes found in globaladdresses, and from static parameters of traversed zones. Globalprefixes delegated by a zone to its child interfaces can be obtainedby autoconfiguration, thanks to to a bidirectional correspondencebetween SAM local addresses and SAM global prefixes.Deployment can be incremental.</t>
