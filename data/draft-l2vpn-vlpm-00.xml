      <t>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) as defined in RFC4761 [RFC4761] and RFC4762 [RFC4762] implementations are highly susceptible to layer-2 loops external to the PE customer-facing interface. Such loops impact performance and can have a detrimental effect on all VPLS traffic throughout the entire instance under certain conditions. Current Layer-2 loop protection and protection mechanisms do not function effectively here. This document describes a protocol function (VPLS External Loop Protection Mechanism (VLPM)) to offer VPLS service providers a mechanism for detecting such layer-2 loops and facilitating configurable actions without the need for inter-operation with customer network protocols, other VPLS PEs or sites.</t>
