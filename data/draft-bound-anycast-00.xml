      <t>This document proposes a minimum set of requirements for IPv6 hosts in order to achieve communication with nodes providing services through IPv6 anycast addresses. We present a mechanism that aims to allow TCP and UDP communication between hosts where the packet exchange is initiated through the usage of an anycast address, without requiring modifications to the general definitions of the transport protocols.</t>
