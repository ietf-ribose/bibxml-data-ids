    <abstract>
      <t>The volume and importance of one-to-many traffic patterns in data centers is likely to increase significantly in the future. Reasons for this increase are discussed and then attention is paid to the manner in which this traffic pattern may be judiciously handled in data centers. The intuitive solution of deploying conventional IP multicast within data centers is explored and evaluated. Thereafter, a number of emerging innovative approaches are described before a number of recommendations are made.</t>
