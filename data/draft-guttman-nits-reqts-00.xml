      <t>Networks in the Small (NITS) are a particular class of networks. These networks may be established in the home, in small offices or even on an impromptu basis. NITS networks typically do not have and should not be expected to have network infrastructure such as DHCP servers, DNS and the like. These networks may have only occasional connectivity to larger networks where these services exist.</t>
