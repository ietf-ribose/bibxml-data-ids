      <t>This document describes two mechanisms in QUIC. The first is the delayed transmission, in which the sender would negotiate a proper time to send traffic to the receiver. The second is the store-and- forward, in which the sender would send the traffic to another place that supports temporary data store and data upload instead of the sender.</t>
