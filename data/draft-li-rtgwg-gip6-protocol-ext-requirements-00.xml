      <t>IPv6 provides extension header mechanism for additional functions. There are emerging features based on the extension headers, such as SRv6, Slicing, Alternate Marking, IOAM, DetNet, APN. However network devices have different capabilities of IPv6 extension header processing which has much effect on the deployment of these features. This document analyses the issues found during the deployment of the above new features using IPv6 extension headers and the protocol extension requirements for IPv6 capability advertisement are defined.</t>
