    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies extensions to RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) protocols to provide capabilities in support of enhanced remotely-directed data placement on memory-addressable devices, including persistent memory. The extensions include new operations supporting remote commitment to persistence of remotely-managed buffers, which can provide enhanced guarantees and improve performance for low-latency storage applications, and to the visibility of such buffers in support of remote shared memory semantics. This document updates RFC 5040 (Remote Direct Memory Access Protocol (RDMAP)) and updates RFC 7306 (RDMA Protocol Extensions).</t>
