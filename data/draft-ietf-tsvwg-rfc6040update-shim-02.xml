      <t>RFC 6040 on "Tunnelling of Explicit Congestion Notification" made the rules for propagation of ECN consistent for all forms of IP in IP tunnel. This specification extends the scope of RFC 6040 to include tunnels where two IP headers are separated by at least one shim header that is not sufficient on its own for packet forwarding. It surveys widely deployed IP tunnelling protocols separated by a shim and updates the specifications of those that do not mention ECN propagation (L2TPv2, L2TPv3, GRE and Teredo). The specification also updates RFC 6040 with configuration requirements needed to make any legacy tunnel ingress safe.</t>
