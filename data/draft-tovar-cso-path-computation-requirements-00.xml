      <t>The cross stratum optimization approach aims for providing a jointly optimized provision of both IT and network resources according to the application demands. In order to do that, the path computation capabilities in the network, which are in charge of finding the optimal connectivity resources, should take into account a new set of requirements. This memo explores the new needs derived from the cross stratum optimization approach.</t>
