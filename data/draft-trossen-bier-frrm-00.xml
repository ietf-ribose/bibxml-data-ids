      <t>This document introduces a semantic for multicast that is based on initiating forward requests, resulting in dynamic return multicast to the set of initiating clients. The key dynamic nature here is represented in the return multicast being possibly different for every transmission. We introduce this semantic more formally, present exemplifying use cases and then focus on realizing this semantic using BIER technology. Although this document formally introduces the FRRM semantic as a new communication semantic, it does not intend to show the realization of it through any other means besides BIER. This is left for separate documents, if desired.</t>
