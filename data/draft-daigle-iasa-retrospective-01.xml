      <t>The IETF Administrative Support Activity was formally established and undertaken as a project of the Internet Society in 2005. In the following 10+ years, the IETF has grown and changed, as have the responsibilities that fall to the IASA. This document reflects on some of those changes and the implications within the IASA structure, providing some areas for further discussion to consider evolving the IASA and the IETF/ISOC relationship.</t>
