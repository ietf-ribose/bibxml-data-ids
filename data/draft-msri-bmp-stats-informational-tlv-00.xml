    <abstract>
      <t>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) defines statistics reports that provide periodic snapshots of various BGP-related metrics. When statistics are reported periodically, the snapshot values may not reflect the variations that occurred between reporting intervals. This document defines a Statistics Information TLV that can be used to convey additional statistical information about BMP gauge-type statistics during the reporting period. This TLV reports the minimum and maximum values observed (with timestamps indicating when they occurred), along with additional statistical measures such as average, median, or snapshot values. This enables BMP collectors to better understand the dynamics of monitored statistics even when the reported snapshot values appear constant.</t>
