      <t>Path Computation Element (PCE) provides functions of traffic engineeringin Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) and IP/MPLS net-works. In IP/MPLS networks, PCE provides MPLS LSP routes with con-straints. In GMPLS networks, PCE provides GMPLS LSP routes and optimalvirtual network topology reconfiguration control, and jugdes on whethera new lower-region LSP should be established when a higher-region LSP isrequested. PCE also handles interworking between GMPLS and IP/MPLS net-works, both of which will coexist at some point during the migrationprocess.</t>
