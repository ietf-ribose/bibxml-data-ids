      <t>This document provides the mechanism for the autoconfiguration of recursive DNS server in mobile node and the optimization of DNS name resolution in the hierarchical mobile IPv6 network. Whenever the mobile node moves into a new MAP domain, the region managed by another MAP, in the hierarchical mobile IPv6 network, it detects the addresses of recursive DNS servers which are placed in the region and replaces the old ones with the new ones for DNS name resolution. This allows the time for DNS name resolution much reduced by using the nearest recursive DNS server which exists in the region. Therefore, the mechanism of this document can optimize the DNS name resolution.</t>
