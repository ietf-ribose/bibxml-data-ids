      <t>In the Internet PKI, trust anchor keys are distributed as self- signed X.509 security certificates. This document specifies a trust anchor key renewal mechanism that leverages the confidence in the initial certificate distribution. A non-critical X.509 certificate extension holds a sequence of opaque octet strings. The trust anchor renewal operation occurs upon receipt of a message that hashes to one of those octet strings.</t>
