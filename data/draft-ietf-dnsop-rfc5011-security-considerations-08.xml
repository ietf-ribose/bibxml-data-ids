      <t>This document extends the RFC5011 rollover strategy with timing advice that must be followed in order to maintain security. Specifically, this document describes the math behind the minimum time-length that a DNS zone publisher must wait before signing exclusively with recently added DNSKEYs. It contains much math and complicated equations, but the summary is that the key rollover / revocation time is much longer than intuition would suggest. If you are not both publishing a DNSSEC DNSKEY, and using RFC5011 to advertise this DNSKEY as a new Secure Entry Point key for use as a trust anchor, you probably don't need to read this document. This document also describes the minimum time-length that a DNS zone publisher must wait after publishing a revoked DNSKEY before assuming that all active RFC5011 resolvers should have seen the revocation- marked key and removed it from their list of trust anchors.</t>
