      <t>This Internet Draft has arisen out of work concentrating on the interconnection of IP and the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) undertaken within the PINT working group. Efforts within this group have, to date, concentrated on the initiation of PSTN services from the Internet. This Internet Draft aims to describe a possible architecture for the implementation of services initiated from the PSTN such as, but not limited to, Internet Call Waiting (ICW). It also identifies the possibility of using this class of service, in conjunction with the PINT work already undertaken, in order to provide a third flavour of service. This Internet Draft deliberately does not to define the protocols for these kinds of services, although descriptions contained within it do use Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) terminology. The purpose of this Internet Draft is to ascertain the level of interest in pursuing this area of work. It is submitted with the goal of forming the basis of an Informational RFC and thereby further work on the standardisation of the provision of these kinds of services.</t>
