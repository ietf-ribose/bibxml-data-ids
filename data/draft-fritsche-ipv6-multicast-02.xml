      <t>Future communication networks will be based more and more on a dynamically changing network topology. Therefore it is advantageous, to have routing mechanisms, which will dynamically adapt their routing decisions to these topology changes. This document describes a set of network protocols, which realize such a dynamical routing of unicast and multicast packets within communication networks based on IPv6. All used routing algorithms will be immediately executed at the occurrence of any topology changes and will therefore have already complete routing information at the receipt of data packets. For the unicasting the Shortest Path First (SPF) routing algorithm has be chosen. This algorithm calculates the shortest, and therefore the optimal routing paths within the routing area, by which it is sufficient for a router, to compute a single routing tree for the whole area. For the multicasting the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) routing algorithm has been chosen. This distributed algorithm prevents the occurrence of endless routing loops, offers for distributed Address Groups nearly optimal results in saving network bandwidth, and needs also only a single routing tree for the whole area. This version 02 of the draft mainly corrects some minor errors of version 01.</t>
