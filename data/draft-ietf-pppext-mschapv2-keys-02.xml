      <t>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method fortransporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. The PPP Compression Control Protocol [2] provides a method to negotiateand utilize compression protocols over PPP encapsulated links. Version 2 of the Microsoft Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol(MS-CHAP-2) [3] is a Microsoft-proprietary PPP authentication protocol,providing the functionality to which LAN-based users are accustomedwhile integrating the encryption and hashing algorithms used on Windowsnetworks.Microsoft Point to Point Encryption (MPPE) [4] is a means ofrepresenting PPP packets in an encrypted form. MPPE uses the RSA RC4[5] algorithm to provide data confidentiality. The length of the ses-sion key to be used for initializing encryption tables can be negoti-ated. MPPE currently supports 40-bit and 128-bit session keys. MPPEsession keys are changed frequently; the exact frequency depends uponthe options negotiated, but may be every packet. MPPE is negotiatedwithin option 18 [6] in the Compression Control Protocol. This document describes the method used to derive the initial MPPE ses-sion keys from MS-CHAP-2 credentials. The algorithm used to change ses-sion keys during a session is described in [4].</t>
