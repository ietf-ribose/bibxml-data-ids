      <t>The initial version of the Open Web Authentication Protocol (OAuth1.0), often referred to as the community addition, included anmechanism for putting a digital signature (when using asymmetrickeys) or a keyed message digest (when using symmetric keys) to aresource request when presenting the OAuth token. This cryptographicmechanism has lead to lots of discussions, particularly about theproblems implementers had, the use cases it supports, and thebenefit-cost tradeoff.This document tries to describe the use of the so-called 'OAuthSignature' mechamism in an unbiased and less emotional way with themain purpose to conclude the discussions.</t>
