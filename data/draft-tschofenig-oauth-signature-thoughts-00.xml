      <t>The initial version of the Open Web Authentication Protocol (OAuth 1.0), often referred to as the community addition, included an mechanism for putting a digital signature (when using asymmetric keys) or a keyed message digest (when using symmetric keys) to a resource request when presenting the OAuth token. This cryptographic mechanism has lead to lots of discussions, particularly about the problems implementers had, the use cases it supports, and the benefit-cost tradeoff. This document tries to describe the use of the so-called 'OAuth Signature' mechamism in an unbiased and less emotional way with the main purpose to conclude the discussions.</t>
