      <t>[RSVP-IPSEC] defines RSVP extensions for IPsec which permit support of reservations for individual IPsec flows, but it does not support aggregate reservations between the IPsec devices with Diffserv [DIFFSERV] classification and scheduling. Conversely, [RSVP-AGG] defines how to aggregate individual RSVP reservations over Aggregate IP reservations when the aggregation region supports Diffserv, but it does not address the case where the Aggregator and Deaggregator use IPsec. Also, [RSVP-AGG] does not address the case where multiple Aggregate reservations are needed for the same DSCP from the same Aggregator to the same Deaggregator. However, there are scenarios requiring aggregate reservations for IPsec tunnels or requiring multiple aggregate reservations for the same DSCP from a given Aggregator to a given Deaggregator. This document specifies the incremental RSVP extensions beyond those defined in [RSVP-IPSEC] and [RSVP-AGG] to support such reservations.</t>
