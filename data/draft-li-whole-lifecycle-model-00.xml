      <t>Dynamic composing Web Services provides an efficient mechanism to offer complex large systems. Substantial progress has already been made towards composing Web Services. Unfortunately, these approaches cannot build a model of the whole life cycle of composed Web Services. In order to solve this problem, this draft designed a whole life cycle model named Service-Cloud model based on the forming picture of clouds in nature. Service-Cloud model can describe the whole life cycle of the composed web Services: discovery, compose, publish, and terminate.</t>
