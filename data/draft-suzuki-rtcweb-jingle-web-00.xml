      <t>XMPP Jingle specification defines an XMPP protocol extension for managing peer-to-peer media sessions between two users. And XMPP Jingle can manage multi contents simultaneously in one Jingle stream, but in the XMPP world there is no common way to layout variable multi contents on each display. In this document, a solution to this issue is provided by using Web browser's layout function. This document describes a new concept to realize one of solutions of RTCWeb. Of course, "Web Browser" is used for Web application's frontend for real-time communication, and XMPP Jingle specification (XEP-166) is used as signaling protocol. And a simple mapping manner between jingle contents and HTML graphical elements enables to unite Web browser's layout function and Jingle's media content management function to realize RTCWeb functions.</t>
