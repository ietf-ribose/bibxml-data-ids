      <t>The MANET Working Group is developing management interfaces, i.e., Management Information Base (MIB) modules, for its control protocols, e.g., Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP), Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF), etc. The NETMOD Working group is developing a set of standard YANG modules for the basic configuration management of standard IP capable devices. Future IP capable radio networks will rely upon these and other modules for their management. The convergence of these activities requires the development of a conceptual radio management model to help promote a consistent set of modules for the configuration, monitoring and notification management of typical wireless radio devices. This document provides such a framework.</t>
