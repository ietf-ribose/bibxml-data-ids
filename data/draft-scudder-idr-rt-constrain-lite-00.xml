      <t>RFC 4684, "Constrained Route Distribution for Border GatewayProtocol/MultiProtocol Label Switching (BGP/MPLS) Internet Protocol(IP) Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)" provides a powerful and generalmeans for BGP speakers to exchange and propagate Route Targetreachability information which is used for cooperative routefiltering. However, the complexity of implementing the entirespecification may have impeded its widespread deployment. Thisdocument specifies the subset of functionality which is required fora provider edge router ("PE") to originate Route Target NLRI. SuchPEs need not implement any filtering functionality.</t>
