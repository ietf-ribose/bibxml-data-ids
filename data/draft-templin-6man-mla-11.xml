    <abstract>
      <t>Ad Hoc networks present an interesting challenge for IPv6 addressing due to the indeterminant neighborhood properties of their interfaces. IPv6 nodes must assign IPv6 addresses to their multihop interface connections to Ad Hoc networks that are locally unique but must not be propagated to other networks. IPv6 nodes must therefore be able to assign self-generated addresses to their interfaces when there are no IPv6 Internetworking routers present that can coordinate topology- relative IPv6 addresses or prefixes. This document specifies a means for IPv6 nodes to generate and assign address types useful for Ad Hoc network communications.</t>
