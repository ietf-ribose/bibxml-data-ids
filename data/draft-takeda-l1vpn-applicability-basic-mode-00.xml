      <t>This document provides an applicability statement on the use of Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and mechanisms to support Basic Mode Layer 1 Virtual Private Networks (L1VPNs). L1VPNs provide customer services and connectivity at layer 1 over layer 1 networks. The operation of L1VPNs is divided into the Basic Mode and the Enhanced Mode where the Basic Mode of operation does not feature any exchange of routing information between the layer 1 network and the customer domain. This document examines how GMPLS protocols can be used to satisfy the requirements of a Basic Mode L1VPN.</t>
