      <t>There is a need for applications using SIP to exchange User to UserInformation (UUI) data during session establishment. Thisinformation, known as call control UUI, is a small piece of datainserted by an application initiating the session, and utilized by anapplication accepting the session. This data is opaque to SIP andits function is unrelated to any basic SIP function. Severalapproaches to transporting call control UUI in SIP have beenproposed. As networks move to SIP it is important that applicationsrequiring this data can continue to function in SIP networks as wellas the ability to interwork with this ISDN service for end-to-endtransparency. This document discusses three mechanisms to meet therequirements defined in the Requirements for SIP Call Control UUIdocument. A new SIP header field which bests meets theserequirements is proposed.</t>
