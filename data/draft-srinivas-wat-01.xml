      <t>This draft specifies Web Address Translation (WAT) mechanism. The scheme allows user to hide or rewrite the backend (and internal) domain addresses. The scheme is based on a suite of URL translation schemes without requiring any of the backend application servers to be reconfigured This allows to host multiple applications on different virtual servers via a single domain. The analogy is similar to NAT except that the proposed implementation scheme operates at the web application layer and brings the value of web address translation mechanism up into the network than doing the functions only in the web servers at the end point.</t>
