      <t>This document describes how to perform third party call control in SIP for both a basic single-media and multi-media call when SDP preconditions are used. This draft considers the Quality of Service and the resource management. There are no new SIP extensions needed to accomplish this. The mechanism outlined is illustrated with examples in order to help understand it.</t>
