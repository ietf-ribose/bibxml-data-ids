      <t>This document describes different scenarios for the introduction of IPv6 in an IPv4 ISP network. The goal is the addition of a native IPv6 service to the already existing IPv4 service without interruption of the IPv4 service. During the IPv6 introduction the network can go through 4 different stages including the initial IPv4 only stage. To move between the stages there will be some form of transition that can be defined in different transition scenarios.</t>
