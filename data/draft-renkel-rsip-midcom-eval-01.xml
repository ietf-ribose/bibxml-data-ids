      <t>This document provides an evaluation of the RSIP (Realm Specific IP) framework and protocol against the evaluation criteria provided by the MIDCOM working group for the evaluation of middle box control protocols. RSIP is defined in experimental RFCs 3102 (Realm Specific IP: Framework) [3] and 3103 (Realm Specific IP: Protocol Specification) [4]; see also RFCs 3104 (RSIP Support for End-to-end IPsec) [5] and 3105 (Finding an RSIP Server with SLP) [6] for more information on RSIP. The document has been updated based on comments made on the MIDCOM mailing list since the previous version of this document was distributed.</t>
