      <t>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) can be used to monitor paths between node. Seamless BFD (S-BFD) provides a simplified mechanism which is suitable for monitoring of paths that are setup dynamically and on a large scale network. This draft describes a method to simplify the implementation of S-BFD over SRv6 by using SRH.flag to instruct the S-BFD peer node to do reverse operation of SRv6 SID list.</t>
