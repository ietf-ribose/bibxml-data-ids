      <t>A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a publickey and associated data. The public key is used to verify digitalsignatures and the associated data is used to constrain the types ofinformation for which the trust anchor is authoritative. A relyingparty uses trust anchors to determine if a digitally signed object isvalid by verifying a digital signature using the trust anchor'spublic key, and by enforcing the constraints expressed in theassociated data for the trust anchor. This document describes someof the problems associated with the lack of a standard trust anchormanagement mechanism as well as problems that must be addressed bysuch a mechanism. This document discusses only public keys as trustanchors; symmetric key trust anchors are not considered.</t>
