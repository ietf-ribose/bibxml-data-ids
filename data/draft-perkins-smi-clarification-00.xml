      <t>This memo is a clarification of the structure of management information (SMI) for version 2 of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). SMIv2 is defined in RFCs 1902[1], 1903[2] and 1904[4]. This version is a rough first draft as requested by the SNMPv2 WG at the SMI Documentation BOF during the June 1996 IETF. This memo assumes that the reader has already read RFCs 1902-4 and generally understands the concepts defined in these documents.</t>
