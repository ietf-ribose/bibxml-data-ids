      <t>The Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is a 17 characters alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a vehicle worldwide. This code is standardized in ISO-3779 and ISO-3780; other standardization bodies' implementation of this code (NHTSA, SAE) is compliant with ISO standards. The VIN is mandatory for each vehicle and used as a unique identity. Some public information related to a vehicle can be obtained knowing its VIN code. An IPv6 address is 128 bit in length and its rightmost bits form the Interface Identifier (IID). When the IPv6 address is used with IPv6- over-Ethernet and Stateless Address Auto-Configuration, the length of the IID is 64 bit. This document presents an experimental method to convert an IPv6 Interface Identifier starting from the VIN code - the VIID. The conversion can be reverted - given a VIID formed from a VIN it easily possible to find out the original VIN.</t>
