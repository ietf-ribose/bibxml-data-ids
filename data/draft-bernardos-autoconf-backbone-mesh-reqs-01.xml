      <t>This Internet Draft presents the multi-hop Backbone Wireless Mesh Network scenario, summarising its basic characteristics and describing the requirements and desired properties of an IP Autoconfiguration mechanism aimed at being used in this kind of networks. Once that the AUTOCONF WG has almost finalised the documents that describe the general architecture of MANETs and the IP autoconfiguration problem statement in MANETs, the WG is expected to start working on solutions. This document describes an ad-hoc scenario that is getting a lot of attention from both telecommunication operators and end-users: Backbone/infrastructure Wireless Mesh Networking. This document identifies and explains the requirements posed by this particular scenario to an IP autoconfiguration mechanism. The goal is to help the AUTOCONF WG identify the requirements that need to be taken into account when designing IP autoconfiguration solution(s) suitable for this Wireless Mesh environment.</t>
