      <t>This Internet Draft presents the multi-hop Backbone Wireless MeshNetwork scenario, summarising its basic characteristics anddescribing the requirements and desired properties of an IPAutoconfiguration mechanism aimed at being used in this kind ofnetworks.Once that the AUTOCONF WG has almost finalised the documents thatdescribe the general architecture of MANETs and the IPautoconfiguration problem statement in MANETs, the WG is expected tostart working on solutions. This document describes an ad-hocscenario that is getting a lot of attention from bothtelecommunication operators and end-users: Backbone/infrastructureWireless Mesh Networking. This document identifies and explains therequirements posed by this particular scenario to an IPautoconfiguration mechanism. The goal is to help the AUTOCONF WGidentify the requirements that need to be taken into account whendesigning IP autoconfiguration solution(s) suitable for this WirelessMesh environment.</t>
