      <t>LIP is an extension of MPLS for use in Lossy and Low power Networks(LLN). Use of MPLS allows rapid response to local topology changeswithin an LLN, while still using full IP routing both within the LLNand for packets that cross into other domains. LIP has optional RIPcommands for discovering and maintaining label switched tree routes.To support local route repair, labeled packets include a path metricused to detect loops in label-switched paths. Labeled messages mayoptionally include a source route or route record at the label levelin order to allow their use without losing the advantages of labelswitching.</t>
