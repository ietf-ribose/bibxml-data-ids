      <t>This document is intended to set the tone as an IETF collaboration to collect various tricks and ''gotchas'' in protocol design. It is not intended to declare the ''right'' and ''wrong'' ways of doing things, but rather ''this practice has the following advantages and disadvantages'', or ''here are several ways of solving the following problem'', with technical explanation of the pros and cons of the various approaches. Discussion will take place on the mailing list folklore@external.cisco.com. To join, send a message to folklore- request@external.cisco.com.</t>
