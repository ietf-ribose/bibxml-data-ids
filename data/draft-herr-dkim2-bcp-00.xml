      <t>[DKIM2] and associated documents describe the DomainKeys Identified Mail v2 (DKIM2) email authentication protocol. DKIM2 is designed to address shortcomings in email authentication protocols and mechanisms released prior to DKIM2, specifically SPF [RFC7208], DKIM [RFC6376], DMARC [RFC7489], and ARC [RFC8617]. Those shortcomings most commonly manifested themselves in email messages that passed through one or more intermediary hosts (e.g., forwarders or mailing list servers) while transiting from origination to final destination. Although these messages were properly authenticated when sent, the alteration of their path and/or content by the intermediary hosts would cause authentication checks to fail at the final destination. In addition, DKIM was susceptible to "replay" of signatures, when attackers would construct abusive messages in such a way that they would pass validation checks for a DKIM signature that had been imported from another message entirely. To address these shortcomings, DKIM2 provides methods not only for intermediary systems to provide details of the changes that they make to a message in transit, but also for receiving hosts to validate those changes in addition to the original message. DKIM2 also allows recipients to detect when messages have been unexpectedly "replayed" and can also ensure that delivery status notifications (DSNs) are only sent to entities that were involved in the transmission of a message. This document describes the recommended usage of the DKIM2 protocol for sending hosts, intermediary hosts, and receiving hosts.</t>
