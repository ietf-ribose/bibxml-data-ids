    <abstract>
      <t>The IPv6 address space is huge. This document discusses how "sparse random addressing" can be used to defeat DDOS attacks, and also to create paid-access websites. The essential idea is to use the host ID portion of an IPv6 address as a time-based password that only paid subscribers know. (They know it by running a program on the device that they use to access the website. That program uses the current time and a secret shared with the web server to calculate the current host ID.) Each subscriber has a unique secret so, at any point in time, uses a unique IPv6 address to access the website. Sparseness prevents attack packets from reaching the web server. Uniqueness creates accountability. To protect routers from flood attacks, the globally routable /48 prefix is also randomized, in a way that exploits BGP route propagation delay to partially or completely quash the flooding at the source, thereby protecting all upstream routers. This early draft only contains a conceptual overview.</t>
