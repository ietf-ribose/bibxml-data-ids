      <t>On email systems that allow for "subaddressing" or "detailed addressing" (e.g., "ken+sieve@example.org"), it is sometimes desirable to make comparisons against these sub-parts of addresses. This document defines an extension to the Sieve mail filtering language that allows users to compare against the user and detail parts of an address. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
