      <t>This document provides a high level conceptual discussion on thesignificant modeling differences affecting the treatment of a POTS(Plain Old Telephone Service) call, a GETS (Government EmergencyTelephone Service) call, and an MLPP (Multilevel Priority andPreemption) call in the traditional voice PSTN (Public SwitchedTelephone Network).The genesis for this discussion on these services is primarily fromexperience with the United States capabilities and it is appreciatedthat these types of calls may be very different or non-existent inother regions of the world. Still, it may be useful to provide thisdiscussion as a background, which may be useful in understanding thelegacy operations as the chartered ieprep work progresses.It should be made clear from the onset that this document suggests norequirements or solutions, but is merely informative about thetradition voice network treatments.</t>
