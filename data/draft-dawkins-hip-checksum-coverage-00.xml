    <abstract>
      <t>This specification suggests two changes to the Host Identity Protocol (HIP) checksum calculation. Specifically, only the HIP header and payload fields would be included in the checksum calculation, and the CRC32c algorithm would be used to compute the checksum. The HIP version number would be incremented if these suggestions are accepted, to reflect a different checksum algorithm.</t>
