      <t>Computing optimum routes for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) acrossmultiple domains in MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and GMPLSnetworks presents a problem because no single point of pathcomputation is aware of all of the links and resources in eachdomain. A solution may be achieved using the Path ComputationElement (PCE) architecture.Where the sequence of domains is known a priori, various techniquescan be employed to derive an optimum path. If the domains aresimply-connected, or if the preferred points of interconnection arealso known, the Per-Domain Path Computation technique can be used.Where there are multiple connections between domains and there isno preference for the choice of points of interconnection, theBackward Recursive Path Computation Procedure (BRPC) can be used toderive an optimal path.This document examines techniques to establish the optimum path whenthe sequence of domains is not known in advance. The documentshows how the PCE architecture can be extended to allow the optimumsequence of domains to be selected, and the optimum end-to-end pathto be derived through the use of a hierarchical relationship betweendomains.</t>
