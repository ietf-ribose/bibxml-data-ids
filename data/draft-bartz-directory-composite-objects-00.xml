      <t>Composite Objects for the Directory (COD) describes an abstractionlayer above the schema, content, and structure facilities of theDirectory. COD enables the construction of reusable information com-ponents from schema primitives. These components include compositeobjects, type-signed object references, graphs of object hierarchies,and object-oriented relationships among Directory objects.COD also provides a repository of templates, or prototypes of theinformation components. This repository captures component designinformation which cannot be expressed in the Directory schema. Thisrepository allows the design of the components to be unequivocablydescribed and reused both within and beyond the immediate Directoryinstance.</t>
