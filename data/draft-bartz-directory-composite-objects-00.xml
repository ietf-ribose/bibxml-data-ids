      <t>Composite Objects for the Directory (COD) describes an abstraction layer above the schema, content, and structure facilities of the Directory. COD enables the construction of reusable information com- ponents from schema primitives. These components include composite objects, type-signed object references, graphs of object hierarchies, and object-oriented relationships among Directory objects. COD also provides a repository of templates, or prototypes of the information components. This repository captures component design information which cannot be expressed in the Directory schema. This repository allows the design of the components to be unequivocably described and reused both within and beyond the immediate Directory instance.</t>
