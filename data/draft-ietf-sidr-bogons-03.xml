      <t>This document defines a standard profile for Bogon OriginAttestations (BOAs). A BOA is a digitally signed object thatprovides a means of verifying that an IP address block holder has notauthorised any Autonomous System (AS) to originate routes that areequivalent to any of the addresses listed in the BOA. A BOA alsoprovides a means of verifying that a BGP speaker is not using an ASwithout appropriate authority. The proposed application of BOAs isintended to fit within the requirements for adding security measuresto inter-domain routing, including the ability to support incrementaland piecemeal deployment of such measures, and does not require anychanges to the specification of the Border Gateway Protocol.</t>
