      <t>The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup language used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of applications. HTML markup can represent hypertext news, mail, documentation, and hypermedia; menus of options; database query results; simple structured documents with inlined graphics and hypertext views of existing bodies of information. This specification defines the capabilities of HTML version 3.0 and provides additional capabilities over previous versions such as tables, text flow around figures and math. It is backwards compatible with HTML 2.0.</t>
