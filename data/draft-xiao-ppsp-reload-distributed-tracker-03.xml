      <t>This document defines PPSP tracker usages for REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD). Although PPSP assumes a centralized tracker from peer's point of view, the logical centralized tracker could be realized by a cluster of geographically distributed trackers. In this draft, we design distributed trackers system, which are organized by RELOAD. It provides lookup service for file/channel indexes and Peer Status among the distributed trackers.</t>
