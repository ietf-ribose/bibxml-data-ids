      <t>Industry control networks host a diverse set of non-internet protocols supporting Industrial-IoT and legacy device connections. The integration between traditional information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) so far has centered around collection of real-time data from devices in OT environment for consumption within the enterprise IT networks. However, improvements in process control and automation require a far better interworking between the OT and IT applications. This document provides a reference framework for integrated industry networks (IIN). It highlights interfaces and their characteristics required for interconnecting components of OT and IT that maybe moved to the cloud or edges. It suggests the use of IIN to bridge the differences between OT and IETF technologies.</t>
