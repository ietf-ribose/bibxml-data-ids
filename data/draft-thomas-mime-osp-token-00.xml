    <abstract>
      <t>The Open Settlement Protocol (OSP)[1], an open standard from theEuropean Telecommunications Standards Institute, specifies a meansby which IP telephony equipment in one administrative domain mayrequest access to IP telephony equipment (including, but not limitedto: Gateways, Gatekeepers, Border Elements, etc.) in anotheradministrative domain. OSP grants such access by returningauthorization tokens, which must then be passed to the destinationIP telephony gateway during call signaling. In order to supportaccess control via OSP, IP telephony signaling protocols must becapable of carrying these authorization tokens in an interoperableway. This memo defines just such a method for protocols, such as theSession Initiation Protocol[2], that can support carriage of MIMEtypes during call signaling. This memo conforms to the requirementsfor MIME type registration defined in RFC 2048[3].</t>
