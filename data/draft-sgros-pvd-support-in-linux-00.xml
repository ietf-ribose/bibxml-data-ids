      <t>The purpose of this draft is to document two implementations which implemented parts of PvD architecture document. One implementation was done from scratch (PvD-manager) while another is a part of an existing component (NetworkManager). The implementation of server component was also done but only in IPv6 router. DHCP was ignored due to IPR claims.</t>
