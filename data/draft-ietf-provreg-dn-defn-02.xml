      <t>Efforts are currently being undertaken to define and formalize registry/registrar communications protocols in light of the current and evolving scope and utility of DNS, domain name registries and related entities. In order for this work to be truly effective and broadly applicable, it is important that accepted definitions act as the foundation. This document is an attempt to create a starting point for the requisite dialogue that will ultimately foster the determination and acceptance of these new protocols. This document obsoletes &lt;draft-rader-dnwhois-defn-00.txt&gt;.</t>
