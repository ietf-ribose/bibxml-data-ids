      <t>CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes andnetworks. CoAP is based on datagram transport, which limits themaximum size of resource representations that can be transferredwithout too much fragmentation. A previous version of this draftdefined the Block option. The Block option provides a minimal way totransfer larger representations in a block-wise fashion. It iscurrently documented in the WG draft draft-ietf-core-block-00.txtThis short I-D attempts to pick up some recent discussion on the CoREmailing list, and defines a more general, but also slightly morecomplex approach. It is intended as an example for a complete designbased on this discussion, to enable a rational assessment of therelative complexities.</t>
