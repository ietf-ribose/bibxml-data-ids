    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a Generic Traffic Conditioner (GTC) for Diffserv-capable nodes [RFC2475, RFC2474]. The GTC employs a token bucket to meter the traffic stream, and a shaping buffer to store out-of-profile packets of a behavior aggregate in order to enforce conformance to the traffic profile. The GTC employs a policer to decide whether to shape, drop, or re-mark the out-of-profile packets. The GTC marks each outgoing packet with a Diffserv codepoint (DSCP) according to the traffic conditioning result in accordance with the Traffic Conditioning Specification. By enabling the components and configuring them with associated traffic parameters, the GTC can be used to condition the traffics for EF PHB [Jacobson], AF PHBs [Heinanen], as well as Class Selector PHBs [RFC 2474].</t>
