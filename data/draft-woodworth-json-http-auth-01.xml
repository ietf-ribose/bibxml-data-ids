      <t>The |JSON| authentication scheme provides a mechanism for exchanging authentication challenges and credentials as objects in the form of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). This scheme offers a secure mechanism of providing authenticated access to a set of protected HTTP resources which may be handled by scripting utility framework as in XMLHttpRequest calls (AJAX) or directly by the client's user agent. This chaining feature is unique to this scheme.</t>
