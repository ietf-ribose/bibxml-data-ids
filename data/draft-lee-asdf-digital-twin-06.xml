      <t>This memo specifies SDF modeling for a digital twin, i.e. a digital twin system, and its interactions. An SDF is a format to describe Things and their associated interactions, and to represent the various kinds of information that is exchanged for these interactions. Therefore, the SDF format can be used to define the behavior of things, i.e. physical objects, and related data and interaction models in a digital twin that contain objects as components.</t>
