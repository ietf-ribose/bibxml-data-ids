      <t>A handover process on Mobile IPv6 requires a time period referred as handoff latency. This latency is not acceptable to support real-time application. We propose a new smooth handoff method using the Explicit Multicast (xcast) technique. On the wired section, control/user packets are multicasted by Xcast scheme to the Base Stations where Mobile Node (MN) can receive, and then packets are passed to the air-link activated between a BS and the MN. This procedure provides mobility in heterogeneous media environment because this handoff mechanism is basically able to implemented without additional control or intelligence of neither intermediate routers.</t>
