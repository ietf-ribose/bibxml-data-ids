    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a new mode for IPsec ESP, known as Bound End- to-End Tunnel (BEET) mode. This mode complements the existing ESP tunnel and transport modes, while enhancing end-to-end IPsec usage. It offers the characteristics of the tunnel mode but without its usual overhead. The BEET mode is designed to accommodate evolving applications of ESP, such as minimalist end-to-end tunnel, mobility and multi-address multi-homing. Additionally, this document proposes a new Notify Message, USE_BEET_MODE, for the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) specified in [RFC7296], to facilitate BEET mode Security Association negotiation.</t>
