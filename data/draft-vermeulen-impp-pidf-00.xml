      <t>This document describes the format of presence information. It makes deliberately abstraction from issues associated with the transport of this information. The proposed format follows the W3C XML recommendation, such that presence information are valid XML documents according to a presence DTD. As several types of devices are envisioned to handle presence information, including devices with low computing power and networking capabilities, the defined format has been kept as simple as possible, with only five tags defined, two of which with no defined attributes.</t>
