      <t>This document describes the format of presence information. It makesdeliberately abstraction from issues associated with the transport ofthis information. The proposed format follows the W3C XMLrecommendation, such that presence information are valid XML documents according to a presence DTD.As several types of devices are envisioned to handle presenceinformation, including devices with low computing power andnetworking capabilities, the defined format has been kept as simpleas possible, with only five tags defined, two of which with nodefined attributes.</t>
