    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes Confucius -- a practical queue management scheme designed for offering real-time flows with consistently low latency regardless of competition. Confucius employs an age-aware weight adjustment mechanism to slows down bandwidth adjustment to match the reaction of congestion control, so that the end host can reduce the sending rate without overshooting the network. Confucius is deployed on home routers and requires no configuration in normal Internet deployments.</t>
