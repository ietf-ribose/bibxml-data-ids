      <t>This memo describes an extension to LDP signaling that enables the PW ownership transfer between the Management Plane and the Control Plane. This document defines all PW transfer related procedures. This includes the handling of failure conditions and subsequent reversion to original state. A basic premise of the extension is that the transfer procedures must never impact an already established Data plane connection.</t>
