      <t>This document proposes a modern, secure, and extensible time synchronization protocol designed to operate over the QUIC transport protocol. Known as TSQ (Time Synchronization over QUIC), this protocol aims to address the limitations of traditional NTP by leveraging QUIC's encryption, widespread UDP/443 acceptance, and multiplexed stream capabilities. TSQ is designed for contemporary deployment environments, including enterprise networks, cloud-native systems, containers, and mobile devices, where traditional UDP-based NTP struggles with security, scalability, or operational reliability.</t>
