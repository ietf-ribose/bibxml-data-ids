      <t>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and networks. Through the Observe option, clients can observe changes in the state of resources and obtain a current representation of the last resource state. This document defines a new mechanism in CoAP Observe so that a CoAP client can conditionally observe a resource on a CoAP server, only being informed about state changes meeting a specific condition or set of conditions. This offers possibilities to extend network intelligence, enhance scalability, and optimize the lifetime and performance in order to address the requirements from the Constrained Nodes and Networks.</t>
