      <t>Devices running SSH are frequently exposed on the Internet, either because of operational considerations or through misconfiguration, making them vulnerable to the constant 3-degree background radiation of scanning and probing attacks that pervade the Internet. This document describes a simple pre-authentication mechanism that limits these attacks with minimal changes to SSH implementations and no changes to the SSH protocol itself.</t>
