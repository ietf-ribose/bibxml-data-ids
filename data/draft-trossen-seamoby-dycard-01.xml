      <t>Many protocols currently being developed for seamless IP-levelhandovers, such as fast handovers and context transfers, possess aninherent requirement that the mobile node and/or it's current accessrouter have a priori knowledge concerning the target of the handover.In particular, the target access router (TAR) should be known to havethe appropriate set of capabilities necessary to meet the requirementsof the mobile node. Although the TAR selection process occurs at ornear the time of handover, applicable candidate access routers (CARs)can be identified in advance. In this draft, we propose a dynamic,distributed protocol, dyCARD, which allows geographically adjacentrouters to exchange capability information, thus providing criticalinformation to the target selection process.</t>
