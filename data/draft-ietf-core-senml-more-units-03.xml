      <t>The Sensor Measurement Lists (SenML) media type supports the indication of units for a quantity represented. This short document registers a number of additional unit names in the IANA registry for Units in SenML. It also defines a registry for secondary units that cannot be in SenML's main registry as they are derived by linear transformation from units already in that registry; RFC 8428 is updated to also accept these units.</t>
