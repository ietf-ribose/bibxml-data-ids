    <abstract>
      <t>This draft describes a number of enhancements that need to be made to virtual private networks (VPNs) to support the needs of new applications, particularly applications that are associated with 5G services. A network enhanced with these properties may form the underpin of network slicing, but will also be of use in its own right. Editor's Note: This is draft-bryant-rtgwg-enhanced-vpn moved to the TEAS WG.</t>
