    <abstract>
      <t>This document systematizes operational practices observed across multiple community-centred deployments that aim to improve meaningful connectivity and digital sovereignty through the circular management of end-user and network devices. It is published as an Informational RFC on the IRTF stream and does not define Internet standards or protocol requirements. The document addresses a foundational but often overlooked dependency of Internet access deployments: the availability, repairability, governance, and lifecycle management of network and user devices required to meaningfully use access networks. It is based on operational experience from deployments in Spain, Argentina, and Senegal—including eReuse.org, EKOA/UNLP, Solidança, TAU/RAEE, and Hahatay. It describes practices that have demonstrated positive access, social, and environmental outcomes. These practices are presented as descriptive guidance derived from operational experience rather than as normative requirements. They complement research within the IRTF GAIA Research Group by documenting reproducible approaches that improve the sustainability, autonomy, and long-term viability of Internet access in underserved contexts.</t>
