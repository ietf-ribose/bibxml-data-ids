    <abstract>
      <t>In certain environments, e.g. large scale virtualization deployments, new devices are created in an automated manner. Such devices typically have their link-layer (MAC) addresses randomized. With sufficient scale, the likelihood of collision is not acceptable. Therefore an allocation mechanism is required. This draft proposes an extension to DHCPv6 that allows a scalable approach to link-layer address assignments.</t>
