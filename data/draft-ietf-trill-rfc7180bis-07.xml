      <t>Since the publication of the TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) base protocol in 2011, active development and deployment of TRILL have revealed errata in RFC 6325 and areas that could use clarifications or updates. RFC 7177, RFC 7357, and an intended replacement of RFC 6439 provide clarifications and updates with respect to adjacency, the TRILL ESADI (End Station Address Distribution Information) protocol, and Appointed Forwarders, respectively. This document provides other known clarifications, corrections, and updates. It obsoletes RFC 7180 (the previous "TRILL clarifications, corrections, and updates" RFC), and it updates RFCs 6325, 7177, and 7179.</t>
