      <t>This document provides an overview of the security requirements and mechanisms considered for delay tolerant networking security. It discusses the options for protecting such networks and describes reasons why specific security mechanisms were (or were not) chosen for the relevant protocols. The entire document is informative, given its purpose is mainly to document design decisions.</t>
