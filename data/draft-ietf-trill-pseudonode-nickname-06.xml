    <abstract>
      <t>The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol provides support for flow level multi-pathing for both unicast and multi-destination traffic in networks with arbitrary topology. Active-active access at the TRILL edge is the extension of these characteristics to end stations that are multiply connected to a TRILL campus as discussed in RFC 7379. In this document, the edge RBridge (TRILL switch) group providing active-active access to such an end station are represented as a Virtual RBridge. Based on the concept of Virtual RBridge along with its pseudo-nickname, this document specifies a method for TRILL active-active access by such end stations.</t>
