      <t>IP carrier network needs to provide real-time traffic visibility to help network operators quickly and accurately locate network congestion and packet loss, and make timely path adjustment for deterministic services in order to avoid congestion. It is essential to explore the adaptive traffic data collection mechanism so as to capture real-time network state at minimum resource consumption. This document summarizes the problems currently faced by network operators when attempting to provide timely traffic data collection to satisfy various scenarios that require real-time network state and traffic visibility, and aggregates the requirements for adaptive traffic collecting mechanism from a variety of deployment scenarios.</t>
