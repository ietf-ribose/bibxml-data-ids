      <t>This document discusses techniques to improve the performance of TCP over satellite-ATM networks. ATM provides the ABR, UBR and GFR service categories for data traffic. TCP experiences poor performance over UBR due to bursty packet losses during congestion. Buffer management and guaranteed rate techniques to improve TCP performance over UBR are presented. The performance of TCP over ABR and the interaction of ABR congestion control mechanisms with TCP congestion control mechanisms are also described. This document is intended to be in informational document for the efficient transport of TCP over satellite-ATM networks.</t>
