      <t>This document discusses the use of One Way Latency (OWL) for enhancing multipath TCP (MPTCP). Several use cases of OWL, such as retransmission policy and crucial data scheduling are analyzed. Two kinds of OWL measurement approaches are also provided and compared. More explorations related with OWL will be helpful to the performance of MPTCP.</t>
