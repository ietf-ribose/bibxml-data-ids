      <t>This document explores applicability of Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) and use case scenarios for different parts of the mobile network. DMM approaches and scenarios are divided into two cases: partially and fully distributed. For each case, benefits and issues are provided. It also refers to applicability of existing protocols and necessity of development of new protocols in order to provide a guideline for best suited solutions for the target architecture.</t>
