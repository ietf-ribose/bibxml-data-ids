      <t>This document describes private extensions to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that enable a network of trusted SIP servers to identify the asserter of private user identity defined in RFC 3325. The use of these extensions is only applicable inside a set of administrative domains with previously agreed-upon policies for generation, transport and usage of such information. This document does NOT offer a general identity model suitable for use between different trust domains, or use in the Internet at large.</t>
