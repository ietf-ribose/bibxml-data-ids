      <t>During the development of Internationalized Domain Name (IDN), it is discovered that there is a substantial lack of information and misunderstanding on Han ideographs and its folding mechanism. This document attempts to address some of the issues on doing han folding with respect to IDN. Hopefully, this will dispel some of the common misunderstanding of this problem and to discuss some of the issues with han ideograph and its folding mechanism. This document addresses very specific problem to IDN and thus is not meant as a reference for generic Han folding. Generic Han folding are much more complicated and certainly beyond this document. However, the use of this document may be applicable to other areas that are related with names, e.g. Common Name Resolution Protocol [CNRP].</t>
