      <t>During the development of Internationalized Domain Name (IDN), it isdiscovered that there is a substantial lack of information andmisunderstanding on Han ideographs and its folding mechanism.This document attempts to address some of the issues on doing hanfolding with respect to IDN. Hopefully, this will dispel some of thecommon misunderstanding of this problem and to discuss some of theissues with han ideograph and its folding mechanism.This document addresses very specific problem to IDN and thus is notmeant as a reference for generic Han folding. Generic Han folding aremuch more complicated and certainly beyond this document. However, theuse of this document may be applicable to other areas that are relatedwith names, e.g. Common Name Resolution Protocol [CNRP].</t>
