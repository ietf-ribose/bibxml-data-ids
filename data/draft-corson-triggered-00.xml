      <t>Layer 2 interfaces fundamentally operate as either broadcast or point-to-point. From these primitives, additional layer 3 interface constructs such as non-broadcast multiple access and point-to- multipoint are created as necessary. This approach has served the wired Internet well. However this memo argues that a third type of layer 2 interface is necessary to seamlessly extend IP over dynamic networks, principally wireless. This interface, here termed a 'triggered' interface, combines traditional broadcast interface addressing semantics (i.e. support for unicast, multicast and broadcast link layer addresses) with layer 2 trigger support for the dynamic creation of peer-to-peer interface associations within an otherwise broadcast interface. Its intended domain of applicability covers cellular, WLAN, MANET, etc; in short all currently envisioned forms of dynamic wireless networking.</t>
