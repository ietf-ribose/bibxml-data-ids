    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes Mastic, a two-party VDAF for the following aggregation task: each client holds a string, and the collector wishes to count how many of these strings begin with a given prefix. Such a VDAF can be used to solve the private heavy hitters problem, where the goal is to compute the subset of the strings that occur most frequently without learning which client holds which string. This document also describes different modes of operation for Mastic that support additional use cases and admit various performance and security trade-offs.</t>
