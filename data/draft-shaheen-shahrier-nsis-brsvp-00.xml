      <t>With the current evolution toward wireless data, wireless internet, and wireless multimedia applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP), video conferencing, and Video telephony, similar performance requirements to those of existing circuit switched or voice based wireless systems are essential to the success of this evolution. Among these performance requirements are the call setup time, delay, reliability, and Quality of Service (QoS). To ensure QoS, provide faster call setup time, and reduce the number of RSVP messaging across the network; this note introduces the concept and describes the use of bi-directional RSVP (B- RSVP) resource reservation protocol with both Controlled-Load and Guaranteed QoS control services. While RSVP allows for uni-directional resource reservations only in the 'send' direction, B-RSVP protocol generalizes the process by allowing simultaneous bi-directional (send and receive) resource reservations on each hop. B-RSVP also allows for a reverse route (receive only) uni-directional resource reservation. B- RSVP is most suitable for applications in which the originator of a service is solely responsible for making the necessary reservations and their cost. This note defines several data objects that carry resource reservation information required for both send and receive traffic. The proposed message formats are extensions to existing RSVP messages and totally backward compatible. The usage and data format of those objects are described herein.</t>
