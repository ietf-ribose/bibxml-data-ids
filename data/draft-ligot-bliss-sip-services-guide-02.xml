      <t>Implementing Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) advanced features andservices requires to use numerous specifications. Today, for eachservice in the scope of BLISS, one can already find references tomany possible specifications which do not cover the same things.Some of them are primitive operations, requirements or call flowexamples, some have a scope larger than the others, or can not becompared at the same level. Very often, architecture hypothesis arehidden behind the same service name, either assuming that anintermediary; like an application server, has an active role in theservice, or, as opposed, assuming a pure end-to-end model where onlyendpoint implementations are involved. The goal of this document isnot to present the best solutions or give recommendations; but togive an overview of every standard specification related to theseservices, centralizing and categorizing them as input to the workinggroup.</t>
