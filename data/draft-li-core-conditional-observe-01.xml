      <t>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and networks. Through the Observe option, clients can observe changes in the state of resources. This document defines a new mechanism in CoAP Observe so that a CoAP client can conditionally observe a resource on a CoAP server, only being informed about state changes meeting a specific condition. Note Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to core@ietf.org.</t>
