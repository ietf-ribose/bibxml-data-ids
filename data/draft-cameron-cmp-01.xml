      <t>One of the problems with terminal servers attached to a LAN is the large number of small packets they can generate. Frequently, most of these packets are destined for only one or two hosts. CMP is a protocol which allows multiple Telnet and Rlogin connections, between a server and a host, to share a single TCP connection. With simple extensions this can be expanded to include other TCP protocols.</t>
