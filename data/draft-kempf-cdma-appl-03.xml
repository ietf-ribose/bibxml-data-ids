      <t>Recently, there have been a variety of proposals submitted to theMobile IP Working Group and to other IETF working groups for IPmobility solutions that seek to enhance or replace mobile IP. Theseproposals, often characterized as micromobility or fast handoff, areaddressed primarily at the perceived need of multimedia sessions suchas video or voice over IP for faster handoff between radio basestations, and are primarily directed at real time multimedia trafficin 3rd generation cellular access networks. In this paper, we discussthe design of CDMA radio access networks (RANs) and the applicabilityof IP mobility to soft handoff in a CDMA RAN. We attempt to show thatgiven current IP routing algorithms and the constraints on a CDMARAN, IP mobility solutions have little, if any, role to play inhandoff within the RAN. In contrast, an IP mobility solution islikely to play a big role in fast handoff between RANs, also calledhard handoff. While future developments in IP networking may changethis situation, IP mobility in CDMA networks currently seems to applyonly when the mobile node roams between disconnected RANs rather thanbetween base stations within a RAN or between connected RANs.</t>
