    <abstract>
      <t>This draft aims to illustrate possible approaches to make network management and operations more autonomic in several aspects. The ultimate goal is that the network could run all by itself, so that users/administrators just feel like there isn't a network to take care of at all (a.k.a. "Networkless"). The approaches are described in a form of different levels (inspired by the Self-Driven Car levels). The higher the level is, the more autonomic management capabilities the network could have. Please note that although some specific technologies are categorized into different levels, it is not the draft's intent to rank them; rather, this draft is more about discussing what's the possible next stage and what's the ultimate vision. Hopefully, this draft could collect people's consensus in the industry and provide guidance for future technology developments.</t>
