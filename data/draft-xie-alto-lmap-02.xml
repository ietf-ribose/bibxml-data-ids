    <abstract>
      <t>Measuring broadband performance on a large scale for network diagnostics is important to providers and users, as well as for public policy. The Large-scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) framework, information model, and protocol have been developed for measurement task dissemination, initialization, reporting and storing. This document uses the ALTO protocol to provide access to large-scale network measurement results, which could be useful to constitute the ALTO cost map service and the endpoint cost service. Potential ALTO protocol extensions are also discussed to better leverage LMAP measurement results.</t>
