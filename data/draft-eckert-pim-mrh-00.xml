      <t>This document describes the IPv6 extensions to support an experiment in which new IPv6 Routing headers that support stateless replication are implemented and deployed for IPv6 Segment Routing Networks. Collectively, these headers are called Multicast Routing Header (MRH). One purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate that the MRH can be implemented and deployed in a production network. Another purpose is to encourage replication of the experiment.</t>
