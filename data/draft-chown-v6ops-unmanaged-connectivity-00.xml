      <t>Tunneling IPv6 packets over the IPv4 Internet played a major role inthe early stages of IPv6 deployment. This was useful because in theearly days the routers in the internet did not support IPv6.Nowadays, tunneling is used to get across legacy equipment and ISPsthat do not support IPv6. Many different tunneling mechanisms havebeen invented. This document describes the drivers for IPv6tunneling, the general architectures of existing mechanisms, and aset of desirable properties against which subsequent analysis of themechanisms may be made. The document is aimed at small end sitesthat may typically utilise tunneling methods in an early IPv6deployment.</t>
