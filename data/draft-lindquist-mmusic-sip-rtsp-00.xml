      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is widely used for establishingmultimedia sessions, whereas the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)is a protocol for use in streaming media systems. RTSP has a dualrole: it establishes a media session for the delivery of streamingmedia as well as controls the streaming session once it has been setup. Since RTSP is also used for session establishment, there existsan overlap between the functionality provided by SIP and RTSP. Inthis document, we analyze a model in which SIP and the SDP offer/answer model are used to set up a streaming session with an RTSPcontrol channel and one or more media delivery streams. Such a modelis beneficial since it allows the reuse of current architecture andfunctionality (e.g., authentication, charging, and QoS) establishedaround SIP also for RTSP-based streaming.</t>
