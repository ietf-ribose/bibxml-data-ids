    <abstract>
      <t>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a routing protocol for autonomous systems running on TCP. It is currently the only protocol capable of handling multiple connections between unrelated routing domains, such as the size of the Internet. BGP is built on the experience of EGP. The main function of BGP system is to exchange network access information with other BGP systems. However, it cannot fully utilize the complete information in the domain to achieve the optimal decision. This document proposes I2BGP, which describes how to obtain desensitization information in the domain to optimize routing decisions.</t>
