      <t>Lightweight 4over6 [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] is an IPv4 over IPv6 hub and spoke mechanism that provides overlay IPv4 services in an IPv6-only access network. Provisioning IPv4 addresse and port set to customers is the core function of Lightweight 4over6 control plane. [I-D.ietf-softwire-lw4over6] illustrates how to use DHCPv6 for deterministic IPv4 provisioning. This document discusses how to provision IPv4 parameters by using dynamic IPv4 provisioning protocols such as DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [I-D.ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-dhcpv6].</t>
