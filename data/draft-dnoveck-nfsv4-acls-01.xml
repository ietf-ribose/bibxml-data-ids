      <t>This document describes the structure of NFSv4 ACLs and their role in the NFSv4 security architecture. While the focus of this document is on the role of ACLs in providing a more flexible approach to file access authorization than is made available by the POSIX-derived authorization-related attributes, the potential provision of other security-related functionality is covered as well. While the goals of the description are similar to that used in previous specifications, the approach taken is substantally different, in that the relationship of the multiple ACL models supported has changed. A core set of functionality, derived form the the now-withdrawn POSIX draft ACLs is presented as the conceptual base of the feature set. Additional features used to provide the functionality within the NFSv4 ACL model are presented as OPTIONAL extensions to that core. The current version of the document is intended, in large part, to result in working group discussion regarding repairing problems with previous specifications of ACL-related features and to enable work to provide a greater degree of interoperability than has been available heretofore. The drafts a framework for addressing these issues and obtaining working group consensus regarding necessary changes. When the resulting document is eventually published as an RFC, it will supersede the descriptions of ACL structure and semantics appearing in existing minor version specification documents for NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1, thereby updating RFC7530 and RFC8881.</t>
