      <t>The RADIUS protocol [RFC2865] has limited support for authenticationand encryption of RADIUS packets. The protocol transports data "inthe clear", although some parts of the packets can have "hidden"content. Packets may be replayed verbatim by an attacker, andclient-server authentication is based on fixed shared secrets. Thisdocument specifies how the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)protocol may be used as a fix for these problems. It also describeshow implementations of this proposal can co-exist with current RADIUSsystems.</t>
