      <t>In this contribution, we present HAWAII: a domain-based approach for supporting mobility. HAWAII uses specialized path setup schemes which install host-based forwarding entries in specific routers to support intra-domain micro-mobility and defaults to using Mobile-IP for inter-domain macro-mobility. These path setup schemes deliver excellent performance by reducing mobility related disruption to user applications, and by operating locally, reduce the number of mobility related updates. Also, in HAWAII, mobile hosts retain their network address while moving within the domain, simplifying Quality of Service support. Furthermore, reliability is achieved through the use of soft-state forwarding entries for the mobile hosts, and the elimination of foreign agents and, in some cases, the home agent.</t>
