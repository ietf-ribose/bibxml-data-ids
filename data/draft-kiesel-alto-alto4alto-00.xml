      <t>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is toprovide guidance to applications, which have to select one or severalhosts from a set of candidates that are able to provide a desiredresource. Entities seeking guidance need to discover and possiblyselect an ALTO server to ask.This document proposes an ALTO-based scheme to select an ALTO serverthat can give guidance to a given ALTO client. Unlike some otherproposed ALTO discovery mechanisms, this solution works well if theclient seeks guidance from a set of ALTO servers that are operated byan entity which is not the operator of the access network.</t>
