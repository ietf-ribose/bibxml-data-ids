      <t>This document describes a payload format for transporting MPEG-4 encoded data using RTP. MPEG-4 is a recent standard from ISO/IEC for the coding of natural and synthetic audio-visual data. Several services provided by RTP are beneficial for MPEG-4 encoded data transport over the Internet. Additionally, the use of RTP makes it possible to synchronize MPEG-4 data with other real-time data types. This specification is a product of the Audio/Video Transport working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force and ISO/IEC MPEG-4 ad hoc group on MPEG-4 over Internet. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at rem-conf@es.net and/or the authors.</t>
