    <abstract>
      <t>In edge computing and distributed cloud environments, a service may be deployed on multiple instances across one or more sites, referred to as edge service. The edge service is typically associated with an ANYCAST IP address. With the emergence of Computing-Aware Traffic Steering (CATS) requirements, there is a growing need to consider both network and computing metrics when making traffic steering decisions. Traditional routing protocols lack the capability to convey compute-related information, necessitating extensions to existing protocols. This draft defines a mechanism to distribute service routes along with computing-related metadata using BGP FlowSpec. The service metadata, including compute resource status and performance metrics, can be collected by a central controller, processed, and then distributed to ingress routers using BGP FlowSpec extensions. This enables ingress routers to make path selections based not only on routing cost but also on the running environment and resource availability of edge services, thereby optimizing Quality of Experience (QoE).</t>
