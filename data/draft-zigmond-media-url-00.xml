      <t>World-Wide Web browsers are starting to appear on a variety of consumer electronic devices, such as televisions and both cellular and wireline telephones. On these devices, some of the URL schemes described in [1] are inappropriate. For example, many of these devices lack local storage, so the 'file' scheme is of little use.

This draft proposes three new URL schemes for accessing such information on appropriate devices.</t>
