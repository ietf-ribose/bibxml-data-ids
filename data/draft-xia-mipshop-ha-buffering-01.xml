      <t>In Mobile IPv6, when a Mobile Node (MN) moves from one Access Router(AR) to another, there is a period during which the MN is unable to send or receive packets because of link switching delay and IP protocol operations. This document specifies a mechanism to reduce packet loss through a Home Agent (HA) buffering downlink packets during the handover period.</t>
