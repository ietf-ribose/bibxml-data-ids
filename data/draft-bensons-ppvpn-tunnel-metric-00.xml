      <t>In the Virtual Router (VR) model of Provider Provisioned VPNsmultiple VRs may be connected using tunnels over an existing IPnetwork, such as IPSec or MPLS based tunnels. In the VR modelthese tunnels often run routing protocols such as RIP or OSPF inorder to distribute route reachability information. This memopresents methods for assigning a meaningful metric to these tunnellinks that can be used by such routing protocols.</t>
