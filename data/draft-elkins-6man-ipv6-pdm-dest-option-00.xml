    <abstract>
      <t>To diagnose problems for a number of Enterprise Data Center Operators (EDCO), two metrics are critical for timely end-to-end problem resolution, both real-time and after the fact, without impacting an operational production network. They are: packet sequence number and packet timestamp. Packet sequence number is required for diagnostics. Packet timestamp is required to calculate end-to-end response time. Current methods are inadequate for these purposes because they assume unreasonable access to intermediate devices, are cost prohibitive, require infeasible changes to a running production network, and / or do not provide timely data. This document solves these problems with a new destination option, the Performance and Diagnostic Metrics destination option (PDM).</t>
