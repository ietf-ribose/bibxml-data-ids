    <abstract>
      <t>A transport network is a server-layer network to provide connectivity services to its client. The topology and tunnel information in the transport layer has already been defined by Traffic-engineered models and OTN models, however, the access to the network has not been described. These information is useful to both client and provider. This draft describe how the client signals are carried over OTN and defined corresponding YANG data model which is required during configuration procedure. More specifically, several client signal (of OTN) models including ETH, STM-n, FC and so on, are defined in this draft.</t>
