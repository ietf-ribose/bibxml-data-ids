      <t>This document describes the core security features of the NFSv4 family of protocols, applying to all minor versions. The discussion includes the use of security features provided by RPC on a per- connection basis. The current version of the document is intended, in large part, to result in working group discussion regarding existing NFSv4 security issues and to provide a framework for addressing these issues and obtaining working group consensus regarding necessary changes. When the resulting document is eventually published as an RFC, it will supersede the description of security appearing in existing minor version specification documents such as RFC 7530 and RFC 8881.</t>
