    <abstract>
      <t>Energy consumption of network infrastructures is growing fast due to exponential growth of data traffic and the deployment of increasingly powerful equipment. There are emerging needs for power-aware routing and traffic engineering, which adapt routing paths to traffic load in order to reduce energy consumption network-wide. This document outlines the design space and problem areas for potential IETF work.</t>
