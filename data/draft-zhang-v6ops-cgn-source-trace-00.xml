      <t>Since NAT function on CGN box will make the IPv4 address re-used bymore than one user, the packets sent outside CGN are not able to beidentifid where they are from or which user they belong to accordingto the source address within the packets. However, under somecertain circumstances, knowing the original source IP address and theidentity of the user who sends the packet out is necessary. Thisdocument states the requirement of source address tracing briefly,and discusses the possible solution models for this issue.</t>
