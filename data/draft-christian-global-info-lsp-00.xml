    <abstract>
      <t>This profile is intended to be used for locating electronic and other information resources without requiring a fixed hierarchy among the locators. The profile specifies the minimum set of required behaviors of conforming servers so that clients using distributed search may discover characteristics of the information resources, perhaps represented as Uniform Resource Characteristics. The profile does not specify how characterization of information resources may be accomplished, how sets of records containing locator information may be compiled, how servers actually conduct searches, nor how user interfaces may operate.</t>
