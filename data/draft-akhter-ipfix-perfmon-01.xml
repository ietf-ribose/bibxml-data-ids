      <t>There is a need to be able to quantify and report the performance ofnetwork applications and the network service in handling user data.This performance data provides information essential in validatingservice level agreements, fault isolation as well as early warningsof greater problems. This document describes IPFIX InformationElements related to performance measurement of network basedapplications. In addition, to the performance information severalnon-metric information elements are also included to provide greatercontext to the reports. The measurements use audio/videoapplications as a base but are not restricted to these class ofapplications.</t>
