      <t>Network Address Translation is a technique for reducing the complexity of address re-assignment. It can also lead to a reduction in the routing state in the core. This draft is about using the technique for the same reasons for multicast. The approach is complementary to IP-in-IP tunnels for multicast, but avoids the overhead of encapsulation. It has the same state setup requirements at the edges, as does NAT.</t>
