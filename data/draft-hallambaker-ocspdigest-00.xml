      <t>The OCSP digest extension creates a strong cryptographic binding between an OCSP token and the certificate it asserts a status value for. Support for the digest identifier extension permits a certificate issuer to employ a high assurance cryptographic digest function such as SHA2 to attest to the authenticity of their certificates in a fashion that is fully downwards compatible with legacy clients that only support SHA1.</t>
