    <abstract>
      <t>IP Payload Compression Protocol (IPComp) is used for compressing the IP payload in transmission to increase the communication performance. The IPComp is applied to payload of the IP datagram, starting with the first octet immediately after the IP header in IPv4, and starting with the first octet after the excluded IPv6 Extension headers. However, Transport layer information such as source port and destination port are useful in many network functions in transmission. This document defines extensions of IP payload compression protocol (IPComp) to support compressing the payload excluding the transport layer information, to enable network functions using transport layer information (e.g., ECMP) working together with the payload compression. This document also defines an extension of IPComp to indicate the payload is not compressed to solve the out-of-order problems between the compressed and uncompressed packets.</t>
