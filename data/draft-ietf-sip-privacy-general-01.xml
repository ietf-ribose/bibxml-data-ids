      <t>This document defines new mechanisms for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in support of privacy. Specifically, guidelines are provided for the creation of messages that do not divulge personal identity information. A new 'privacy service' logical role for intermediaries is defined to answer some privacy requirements that user agents cannot satisfy themselves. Finally, means are presented by which a user can request particular functions from a privacy service.</t>
