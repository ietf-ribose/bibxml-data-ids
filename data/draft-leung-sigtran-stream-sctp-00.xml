      <t>This document describes two stream function extensions to SCTP (Stream Transmission Control Protocol) [SCTP]. These extensions are to allow dynamic modifications of stream status when U-SCTP (Unreliable Extension to SCTP) [USCTP] is activated and on demand insertion/deletion of streams within a SCTP association. These extensions will provide a better support of multimedia applications since they allow users to set and modify communication options, say the choices of transport and reliability requirements, on the fly.</t>
