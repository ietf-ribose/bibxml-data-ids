      <t>Service function chaining (SFC) allows the instantiation of an ordered set of service functions and subsequent "steering" of traffic through them. Service functions provide an specific treatment of received packets, therefore they need to be known so they can be used in a given service composition via SFC. This document discusses the need for service function discovery mechanisms and propose some solutions for sfc-aware nodes to discover available service functions in fog environments.</t>
