      <t>It has been recognized that the success of the MPLS depends on theability to better support the multiservice traffic integration withsome levels of service guarantees, which are not feasible toimplement with the current destination prefix only based packetforwarding paradigms.The efficient support for these services throughout the network isexpected to be possible using label based forwarding paradigm in thenetwork. Through the use of either RSVP based or LDP/CR-LDP basedsignaling, MPLS can also provide certain QoS guarantees using theLSPs.The goal of this document is to define a framework for servicedifferentiation in MPLS networks. We discuss a set of services thathave been identified so far for IP, and describe the trafficmanagement mechanisms in various network elements that are neededfor enabling the implementation of these more advanced services inMPLS networks.</t>
