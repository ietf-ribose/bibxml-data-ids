    <abstract>
      <t>It has been recognized that the success of the MPLS depends on the ability to better support the multiservice traffic integration with some levels of service guarantees, which are not feasible to implement with the current destination prefix only based packet forwarding paradigms. The efficient support for these services throughout the network is expected to be possible using label based forwarding paradigm in the network. Through the use of either RSVP based or LDP/CR-LDP based signaling, MPLS can also provide certain QoS guarantees using the LSPs. The goal of this document is to define a framework for service differentiation in MPLS networks. We discuss a set of services that have been identified so far for IP, and describe the traffic management mechanisms in various network elements that are needed for enabling the implementation of these more advanced services in MPLS networks.</t>
