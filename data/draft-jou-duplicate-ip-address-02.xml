      <t>The Address Resolution Protocol specifies the scheme to resolve the hardware address of a host by using its IP address. The hardware addresses are normally unique for each hardware module because they were assigned by manufacturers; but there is much less control on the uniqueness of IP addresses on a LAN. With the booming network popularity, the possibility of the same IP address being used on different hosts is increasing. The duplication may come from users' or network administrators' mistakes, or configuration errors on host addresses assigning programs such as BOOTP or DHCP servers. This document is to define an extension to the original ARP protocol to prevent a newly configured host from making much damage to a host that has been the owner of the same IP address. The solution is based on the de-facto gratuitous ARP packets with modification on a host's behavior when an address duplication is detected.</t>
