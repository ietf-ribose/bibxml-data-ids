      <t>Under certain circumstances the desired effects of diversion can be achieved with no per-packet transport overhead. This draft describes these circumstances as well as the per-packet bearer processing and general signaling requirements of some proposals that strive to remove the need for this overhead. The first proposal is referred to as Zero-Overhead Diversion (ZOD). The second is referred to as More Robust Zero-Overhead Diversion (MR. ZOD). Mobile IP and load distribution are examples of the useful application of diversion.</t>
