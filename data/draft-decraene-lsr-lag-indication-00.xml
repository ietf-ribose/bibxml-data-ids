      <t>This document defines a new link flag to advertise that a layer-three link is composed of multiple layer-two sub-links, such as when this link is a Link Aggregation Group (LAG). This allows a large single flow (an elephant flow) to be aware that the link capacity will be lower than expected as this single flow is not load-balanced across the multiple layer-two sub-links. A path computation logic may use that information to route that elephant flow along a different path.</t>
