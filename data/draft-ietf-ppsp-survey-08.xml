      <t>This document presents a survey of some of the most popular Peer-to- Peer (P2P) streaming applications on the Internet. The main selection criteria have been popularity and availability of information on operation details at writing time. In doing this, selected applications are not reviewed as a whole, but they are reviewed with main focus on the signaling and control protocol used to establish and maintain overlay connections among peers and to advertise and download streaming content.</t>
