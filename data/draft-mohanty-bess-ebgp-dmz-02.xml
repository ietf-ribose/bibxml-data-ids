    <abstract>
      <t>The DMZ Link Bandwidth draft provides a way to load-balance traffic to a destination (which is in a different AS than the source) which is reachable via more than one path. Typically, the link bandwidth (either configured on the link of the EBGP egress interface or set via a policy) is encoded in an extended community and then sent to the IBGP peer which employs multi-path. The link-bandwidth value is then extracted from the path extended community and is used as a weight in the FIB, which does the load-balancing. This draft extends the usage of the DMZ link bandwidth to another setting where the ingress BGP speaker requires knowledge of the cumulative bandwidth while doing the load-balancing. The draft also proposes neighbor- level knobs to enable the link bandwidth extended community to be regenerated and then advertised to EBGP peers to override the default behavior of not advertising optional non-transitive attributes to EBGP peers.</t>
