    <abstract>
      <t>RFCs 951 [1], 1541 [2], and 1542 [3] describe the interactions of BOOTP [1] and DHCP [2] client, server, and relay agents. However, further experience with these protocols has revealed the existence of an interoperability issue. The issue occurs when a given IP subnet is constructed over one link-layer network inter-connected by translational bridges to other dissimilar link-layer networks. The following information attempts to address this problem. It is impossible for a BOOTP or DHCP client, server, or relay agent to know in advance whether or not it will be operating in a mixed media link-layer network environment. Given this fact, all BOOTP and DHCP client, server, and relay agents SHOULD adopt the recommendations defined in this memo.</t>
