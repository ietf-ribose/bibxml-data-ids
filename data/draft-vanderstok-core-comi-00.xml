      <t>The draft describes an interface based on CoAP to manage constrained devices. Access to existing MIBs is included. The proposed integration of CoAP with SNMP reduces the code size by removing an important part of the SNMP code. The draft lists a set of CoMI objects that describe the operational settings of the applications on the device. A majority of them is taken over from other drafts to provide one uniform CoMI based access. Note Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to core@ietf.org.</t>
