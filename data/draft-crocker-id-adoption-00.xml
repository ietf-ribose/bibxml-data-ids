      <t>The productive output of IETF working groups is documents, as mandated by the working group's charter. Working groups develop these documents based on initial input of varying levels of maturity. An initial working group draft might be a document already in wide use, or it might be a blank sheet, wholly created by the workiing group, or it might represent any level of maturity in between. This document discusses the process of creating formal working group drafts that are targeted for publication.</t>
