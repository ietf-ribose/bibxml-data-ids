      <t>This document discusses the requirements of an application layerprotocol for Discovery Services. Discovery Services at its coreoffers to authenticated and authorized users the means to discoverresources of information for a particular identifier. Theinformation resource can be any data source which provides aninterface on a network that allows for retrieval of the data. Aninformation resource could publish its network address (reference tothe resource) to a Discovery Service coupled with an identifier.Then an authenticated and authorized user could query the DiscoveryService with the same identifier to receive reference information tothe resources. Interfacing with the resources for actuallyretrieving the data is out of scope of Discovery Services; the roleof Discovery Services is to enable a client to find the networkaddresses and types (e.g. URLs) of information resources for aparticular identifier of interest.This protocol is applicable to numerous scenarios such as track andtrace in trade supply chains, where a number of independent resourcesmay hold information about a particular object and may have aninterest in selective sharing of that information, in order toimprove the efficiency of the supply chain network.However, other applications can be envisaged, as a 'bottom-up' or'grassroots' way for generators of information content to: 1) declarethat they have information or commentary on a particular topic orsubject (which might be a physical object, geographic location oreven an abstract concept) 2) specify a network address through whichthat content can be retrieved, 3) specify restrictions about thecommunity of clients that are entitled to receive knowledge about theexistence of their content or see the link. This approach can becontrasted with the top-down approach of existing web search enginesthat rely on crawling/spidering of content that must be alreadyposted in the public domain before it can be indexed - and where thelink information is generally made publicly available in a mannerthat does not discriminate between clients on an individual basis.This document outlines a set of design concerns that an applicationlayer protocol needs to address in order to be widely adopted anddeployable on public networksThis document obsoletes "Extensible Supply-chain Discovery ServiceProblem Statement draft-rezafard-esds-problem-statement-02".Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the mailing list atesds@ietf.org and/or the author(s).</t>
