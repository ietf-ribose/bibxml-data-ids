      <t>As the Internet grows, the importance of Uni-Directional Links such as satellite links has been increasing. However, most of existing routing protocols assume that datalinks are bi-directional. To incorporate UDLs into the Internet, an IP tunneling approach has been proposed, where tunnels are set up as a virtual back-channel of a UDL to carry routing information between Feeders and Receivers. Dynamic Tunnel Configuration Protocol (DTCP) supports to setup tunnels dynamically between Feeders and Receivers in such environments.</t>
