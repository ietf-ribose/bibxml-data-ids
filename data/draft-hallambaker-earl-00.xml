      <t>This document describes the Encrypted Authenticated Resource Locator (EARL) URI scheme and the encoding and decoding of the associated content data. An EARL is a bearer token that allows an encrypted data object to be located, decrypted and authenticated using a compact URI form designed for human readability. A range of work factors is supported from 2^112 to 2^252. The plaintext data format consists of an initial header section containing metadata describing the payload, the payload itself and an optional section containing signature data.
