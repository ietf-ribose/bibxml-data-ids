      <t>This document requests IANA registration of a new DNS OpCode andErrorCode type in facilitating encryption of DNS requests andreplies and feed back to the client if plain text requests are notacceptable. Once this OpCode is seen the DNS server attempts todecrypt the request using its private OpenPGP key. Inside theencrypted packet is the AES key which the client expects to be usedwhen the server encrypts a response. A server may advertise that itis capable of DNS encryption by returning OpenPGP fingerprints inTXT records using a similar format to Public Key Association (PKA).The full pubic keys are returned from DNS servers by using a CERTrequest against the host name(s) of the domain's NS records or viaOpenPGP key servers.</t>
