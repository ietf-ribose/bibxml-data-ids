      <t>In traditional telecommunication system, operators usually provide general and limited security protection service for users during access (e.g. AKA in 3G/4G network). Now, with the development of network virtualization technology and data center, physical network devices can be replaced by network function softwares which are running on virtual machines and the network function can be flexible and elastic. Operators can provide users with more security services. So this interfaces between operator's network and users are highly desired. These interfaces will be used to request/achieve (Virtual) Network Security Functions from operator's network. This draft describes use cases for using the interface in operator's network environment.</t>
