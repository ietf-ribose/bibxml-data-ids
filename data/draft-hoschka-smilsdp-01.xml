      <t>This document describes an approach for integrating the functionality currently contained in [47]SDP (Session Announcement Protocol) into [48]SMIL (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language). The motivation is to make it easier for SMIL authors to interface with the existing RTP/MBone infrastructure. Currently, this requires maintaining two different sets of files, each of which use a different text format. Another motivation is to save one network round-trip per RTSP URL in the SMIL file, since the information contained in the SDP file is now directly included in the SMIL file.</t>
