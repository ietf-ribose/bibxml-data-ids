      <t>This document describes a mechanism to model a broadcast network as ahybrid of broadcast and point-to-multipoint networks for purposes ofOSPF operation. Neighbor discovery and maintenance as well as LSAdatabase synchronization are performed using the broadcast model, butthe network is represented using the point-to-multipoint model in therouter LSAs of the routers connected to it. This allows an accuraterepresentation of the cost of communication between different routerson the network, while maintaining the network efficiency of broadcastoperation. This approach is relatively simple and requires minimalchanges to OSPF.</t>
