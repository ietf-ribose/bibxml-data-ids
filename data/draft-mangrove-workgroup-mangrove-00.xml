    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a novel system called Mangrove for obtaining global visibility across the Internet. It achieves this through constructing a comprehensive, unified representation of the Internet's topology and routing behavior by aggregating and indexing diverse data sources. he core challenge is obtaining an accurate, up-to-date model of how packets traverse the global Internet given the Internet's vast scale, dynamic nature, and fragmented visibility across multiple organizations collecting data in different formats. Mangrove addresses this by leveraging the hierarchical structure and natural abstractions of Internet architecture. It collects and integrates data from traceroute measurements, BGP routing tables, IP allocation records, and active broadband measurements. This multi-source data is partitioned and indexed across multiple granularity levels - geographic regions, autonomous systems, and IP prefixes - allowing effective storage, querying, and scalable processing. Mangrove constructs a unified topology and routing representation augmented with an extensible ruleset derived from Internet axioms and measured data. For arbitrary source-destination pairs, it computes estimated packet paths and associated performance metrics at the highest feasible granularity level based on available information completeness. The system handles real-time Internet dynamics through incremental rule refinement using detected changes in routing data and measurements. This enables timely updates to the topology model without full recomputation. Mangrove aims to provide researchers and operators an unprecedented unified Internet view for analysis, optimization, planning, security, and regulatory tasks.</t>
