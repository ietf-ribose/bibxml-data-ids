    <abstract>
      <t>All kinds of VPN technologies have been widely deployed to bear different services. As new applications develop, there proposes the requirement of auto-discovery of Layer 3 Virtual Private Network (L3VPN) and enhanced auto-discovery requirements for other VPN technologies which already have the auto-discovery mechanisms. This document identifies the possible applications and these auto- discovery requirements. Accordingly this document defines a new BGP NLRI, called the BGP-VPN-INSTANCE NLRI to satisfy the requirement of auto-discovery of BGP VPN instance and a new type of the extended community, called the Import Route Target which can be applied for auto-discovery mechanisms of multiple VPN technologies.</t>
