      <t>Several solutions to internet mobility have been offered. But the solutions are sometimes for different kinds of mobility with different kinds of requirements. It becomes confusing to see these disparate types of mobility being discussed in the same vein. This document is an attempt to delineate and classify different types of network mobility. This attempt shall help us in understanding already existing mobility solutions and at the same time help us in proposing new solutions. Adding security to mobility adds a new dimension by itself. Various types of secure mobility are discussed closely following the types of mobility.</t>
