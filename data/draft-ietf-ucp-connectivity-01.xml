      <t>Users having trouble with the Internet are directed to contact their designated Network Service Center. The Network Service Center creates a Trouble Ticket which is registered with the Ticket Tracking System. The ticket is an agreement to obtain closure with the user. Network Service Centers can fix problems, track the work of others, or transfer responsibility for the ticket to other Network Service Centers using a formal hand-off procedure. Ticket hand-offs are coordinated by the Ticket Tracking System and ticket progress is monitored by the Ticket Support Centers. User complaints with the problem resolution process may be lodged with a Ticket Support Center, which will act on behalf of the user in resolving the problem.</t>
