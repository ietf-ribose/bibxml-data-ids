      <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computationfunctions in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol LabelSwitching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.A limited form of statefulness is useful to improve PCE functionalityin situations in which the local TED might not be up to date, or inthe case of concurrent requests where most of the LSPs are computedbefore the end of the set-up of the LSPs when the TED is updated.The PCE can retain some context from the resources assigned to PathRequests during a certain period of time, so that it avoidssuggesting the use of the same resources for subsequent TE LSPs.This document proposes an extension to the PCEP protocol to allow thePCC to request the PCE to block or reserve the resources computed ina path request of a TE LSP for subsequent requests for a certaintime.</t>
