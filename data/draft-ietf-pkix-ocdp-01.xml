    <abstract>
      <t>This Internet Draft specifies some proposed enhancements to the X.509 CRL mechanism used to determine if a public-key certificate is valid or revoked. These enhancements provide advantages over existing CRL mechanisms, including those that use static CRL partitioning as defined in ISO/IEC 9504-8/ITU-T Rec. X.509. In particular, the mechanisms proposed can: (a) reduce the need for unnecessarily fetching unchanged CRLs, thereby greatly expanding the value of caching CRLs; (b) allow CRL timeliness to be improved; (c) accommodate dynamic partitioning as opposed to fixed partitioning; (d) better support use of certificates in multiple environments with different CRL stores. This document is submitted for consideration as the basis of possible future IETF standardization. Please send comments on this document to the ietf-pkix@imc.com mail list.</t>
