      <t>Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) provides for high reliability and availability for IP connectivity across any combination of wired and wireless network segments. The RAW Architecture extends the DetNet Architecture and other standard IETF concepts and mechanisms to adapt to the specific challenges of the wireless medium, in particular intermittently lossy connectivity. This document defines a network control loop that optimizes the use of constrained spectrum and energy while maintaining the expected connectivity properties, typically reliability and latency. The loop involves DetNet Operational Plane functions, with a new recovery Function and a new Point of Local Repair operation, that dynamically selects the DetNet path(s) for the future packets to route around local degradations and failures.</t>
