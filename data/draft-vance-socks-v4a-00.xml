      <t>This document specifies SOCKS 4A, an extension to the SOCKS Version 4 protocol. This extension allows SOCKS clients to delegate domain name resolution to the SOCKS server. This is particularly useful in environments where the client host cannot resolve the destination host's domain name due to restrictive network policies or lack of DNS access.
