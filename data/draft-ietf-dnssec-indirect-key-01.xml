      <t>RFC 2065 defines a means for storing cryptogrpahic public keys in the Domain Name System. An additional code point is defined for the KEY resource record (RR) algorithm field to indicate that the key itself is not stored in the KEY RR but is pointed to by the KEY RR. Encodings to indicate different types of key and pointer formats are specified.</t>
