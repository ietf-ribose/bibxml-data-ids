      <t>In various applications of MPLS, label stacks with multiple entriesare used. In some cases, it is possible to replace the top label ofthe stack with an IP-based encapsulation, thereby enabling theapplication to run over networks which do not have MPLS enabled intheir core routers. MPLS-in-IP and MPLS-in-GRE encapsulations havealready been specified by the MPLS WG. In some cases, in addition toIP and GRE tunnels, it may be desirable to use IPsec for transportingMPLS packets securely over non-MPLS networks, using standard IPsecauthentication and/or encryption functions. This draft describesprocedures for encapsulating MPLS packets in IPsec.</t>
