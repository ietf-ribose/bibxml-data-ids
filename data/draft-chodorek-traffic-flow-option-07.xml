      <t>Information about the behavior of the stream that will be transmitted in the near future will allow for better management of queues in the router and thus improve QoS and reduce the potential for a serious overload. Such information is often available in the transmitter. The proposed IP option allows for the sending of information about forthcoming traffic from the transmitter to the intermediate nodes.</t>
