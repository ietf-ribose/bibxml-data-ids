      <t>The network in datacenter is required to provide a tenant network, which should be virtualized, and be able to provide L2 switching or L3 routing capability. A combined L2&amp;L3 solution could provide great scalability for both Layer2 and Layer3 switching. In this document, we propose to apply centralized server to be the control plane of the combined L2&amp;L3 solution, to provide better scalability for the control plane. The combined L2&amp;L3 solution in this draft is named Virtualized Integrated Routing&amp;Bridging (shorted as VIRB).</t>
