      <t>Multicast has become increasingly important with the emergence ofnetwork-based applications such as IP telephony and videoconferencing. The Internet community has done a significant amountof work on IP multicast over the last decade [1-10] and as aresult, there are a number of multicast applications that are usedtoday on the Mbone, the multicast-capable virtual network that islayered on top of (portions of) the Internet [10]. However, whiletoday's multicast schemes are scaleable in the sense that they cansupport very large multicast groups, there are scalability issueswhen a network needs to support a very large number of distinctmulticast groups. This document describes a new scheme formulticast that complements the existing schemes. Whereas theexisting schemes can support a limited number of very largemulticast groups, the scheme described here can support a verylarge number of small multicast groups.</t>
