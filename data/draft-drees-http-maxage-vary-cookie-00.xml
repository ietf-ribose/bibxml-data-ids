      <t>The maxage-vary-cookie HTTP response Cache-Control extension allowsan origin server to instruct caches to serve a stale response if theDate header field-value received with the response is greater than aspecified date-valued request cookie. It can be used to implement asimple view consistency mechanism for read/write applications whileextending freshness lifetimes, reducing latency, bandwidth usage, andorigin server load in some situations.</t>
