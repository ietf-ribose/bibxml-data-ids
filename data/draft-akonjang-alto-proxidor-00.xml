      <t>Several applications, such as peer-to-peer (P2P), contentdistribution and realtime services rely on selection mechanisms inorder to select the peer or server from which to request the service.Examples of such services are: file sharing, media streaming andvoice gateways.Application-layer selection algorithms do not typically take intoaccount network-layer topology information; either that informationis unavailable to them, or when such information is available (e.g.,from BGP Looking Glass servers), it does not include sufficientinformation about the local topology in the neighbourhood of theapplication client(s). Therefore, most applications today make theirselection decisions based on performance measurements (combined withsome amount of random selection) and largely ignore network layerrouting. It has been demonstrated that by keeping the traffic local(e.g., within the same Autonomous System) both infrastructureutilization and application performance may be improved.By enhancing selection algorithms through the use of accuratenetwork-layer topology, applications may improve performance whilenetwork operators are also able to reduce the utilization ofinfrastructure resources by application traffic. At the same time,exchange of information between the application and the networkshould not be allowed to compromise confidentiality for either party.Detailed routing information owned by the service provider should notbe made publicly available, while detailed information about theapplication should also not be made known to the service provider.This draft introduces a signaling protocol which we call "PROXIDOR".The PROXIDOR protocol is a request-response protocol in which aPROXIDOR Client (PxC) issues requests to and receives responses froma PROXIDOR Server (PxS). The questions of how a PxC discovers a PxSand how a PxS acquires network-layer topology information are beyondthe scope of this document.</t>
