      <t>The international community needs advice as to what standards to rely on for the operational implementation of services for Emergency Preparedness. This draft outlines the best current practices to provide deterministic behavior of Internet applications during emergencies using Differentiated Services. It should be noted that there can be more than one suitable approach and this draft only describes what can be done with the existing Differentiated Services architecture.</t>
