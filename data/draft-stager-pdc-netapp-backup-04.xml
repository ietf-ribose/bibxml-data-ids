      <t>The Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) is an open protocol for enterprise-wide network based backup. The NDMP architecture allows network attached storage vendors to ship NDMP compliant file servers which can be used by any NDMP-compliant backup administration application. This same architecture is also used for network-attached backup devices, such as tape drives and tape libraries.</t>
