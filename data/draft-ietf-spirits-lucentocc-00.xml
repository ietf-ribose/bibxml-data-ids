    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the pre-SPIRITS Implementation of the SPIRITS-like services in the Lucent Technologies Online Communications Center (OCC). To this end, this document is a contribution to the future Informational RFC, which is to be published by the SPIRITS WG as indicated in its charter. On the PSTN side, the OCC platform systematically uses the Intelligent Network (IN) solutions, which were industry-proven to be reliable, scalable, and compatible with the existing PSTN infrastructure and services, yet easily adaptable to the Internet requirements. Other essential elements of the platform include the use of 1) Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) messaging services 2) Point-to-Point (PPP) Protocol 3) Interactions with the Voice-over-IP (VoIP) Gateway and Gatekeeper for establishing the combined voice path through PSTN and Internet 4) Microsoft NetMeeting (tm) software at the end-users' PCs (or Internet appliances) 5) Java (tm) Run-Time Environment (JRE), and 6) 1.2 Java Native Interface (JNI) for certain security capabilities</t>
