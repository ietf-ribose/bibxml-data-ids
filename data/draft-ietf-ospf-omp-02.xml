      <t>OSPF may form multiple equal cost paths between points. This is true of any link state protocol. In the absense of any explicit support to take advantage of this, a path may be chosen arbitrarily. Tech- niques have been utilized to divide traffic somewhat evenly among the available paths. These techniques have been referred to as Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP). An unequal division of traffic among the available paths is generally preferable. Routers generally have no knowledge of traffic loading on distant links and therefore have no basis to optimize the allocation of traffic. Optimized Mulitpath is a compatible extension to OSPF, utilizing the Opaque LSA to distribute loading information, proposing a means to adjust forwarding, and providing an algorithm to make the adjustments gradually enough to insure stability yet provide reasonably fast ad- justment when needed.</t>
