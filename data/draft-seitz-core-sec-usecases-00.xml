      <t>This document presents use cases for security measures in scenarios involving constrained RESTful devices. Special focus is placed on access control and authentication. Where specific details are relevant, it is assumed that the devices use CoAP as communication protocol, however most conclusions apply generally. A number of security requirements are derived from the use cases, which are intended as a guideline for developing a comprehensive authentication and authorization approach for this class of scenarios.</t>
