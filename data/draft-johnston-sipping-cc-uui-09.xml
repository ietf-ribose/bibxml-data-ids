      <t>Several approaches to transporting the ITU-T Q.931 User to UserInformation Element (UU IE) data in SIP have been proposed. Asnetworks move to SIP it is important that applications requiring thisdata can continue to function in SIP networks as well as the abilityto interwork with this ISDN service for end-to- end transparency.This document discusses three mechanisms to meet the requirementsdefined in the Requirements for SIP Call Control UUI document. A newSIP header field which bests meets these requirements is proposed.</t>
