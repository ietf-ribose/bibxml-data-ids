      <t>When the OCSP protocol was defined, the design was based on full compatibility with CRL-based mechanisms. This requires the use of a complex means of certificate identification that has resulted in interoperability problems among implementations, a design unsuited for high-throughput, real-time operation, the inability to provide an unambiguous certificate status response (the only thing that a CRL can say with certainty is 'revoked'), and an online responder tied to an offline mechanism (some CAs issue CRLs only once or twice a day, even though they have an online, real- time certificate store available). A more practical problem is that it makes it impossible to implement an OCSP responder not based on CRLs, for example one that consults a certificate database or in-memory hash table to determine the presence or absence of a valid certificate.</t>
