      <t>The Session Peering Provisioning Protocol (SPPP) is an XML protocolthat exists to enable the provisioning of session establishment datainto Session Data Registries or SIP Service Provider data stores.Sending XML data structures over Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)and HTTP(s) is a widely used, de-facto standard for messaging betweenelements of provisioning systems. Therefore the combination of SOAPand HTTP(s) as a transport for SPPP is a natural fit. The obviousbenefits include leveraging existing industry expertise, leveragingexisting standards, and a higher probability that existingprovisioning systems can be more easily integrated with thisprotocol. This document describes the specification for transportingSPPP XML structures over SOAP and HTTP(s).</t>
