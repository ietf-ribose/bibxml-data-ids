      <t>The connection model in MGCP grew from a half-connection model, to, more recently, a model that allows a second edgepoint to be specified [3]. In this document, we have taken the connection model a step further, making it symmetrical, identifying the difference between external connections and an MG- connection, allowing signalling related commands to be asso- ciated with either edgepoint, or with both edgepoints in an MG. While the half-connection model may work best for the simple case of MGs with an external IP connection on one side, the proposed more general connec- tion model adapts easily when the MG is for packet to packet connec- tions, when the MG is TDM on one side and IP on the other, as well as when the external connections are ATM on either side of an MG.</t>
