      <t>As a special kind of Internet multicast, Explicit multicast(Xcast)[1] encodes destination addresses of all the receivers into the packet. Not requiring membership management and routing information exchange in the intermediate routers in contrast to the legacy Internet multicast or Deering multicast, Xcast can effectively provide multicast service to Internet without those overheads. A node mobility supporting protocol, Mobile IP[2,3], requires to be modified to appropriately intercept, route and forward Xcast packets. This document specifies the protocol operations for the mobile agent, the mobile node and the correspondent node to support transmission and reception of Xcast datagram over Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6.</t>
