    <abstract>
      <t>Many OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 deployments run on overlay networks provisioned by means of pseudo-wires or L2-circuits. When the devices in the underlying network go for maintenance, it is useful to divert the traffic away from the node before the maintenance is actually scheduled. Since the nodes in the underlying network are not visible to OSPF, the existing stub router mechanism described in [RFC3137] cannot be used. It is useful for routers in an OSPFv2 or OSPFv3 routing domain to be able to advertise a link being in an overload state to indicate impending maintenance activity in the underlying network devices. This information can be used by the network devices to re-route the traffic effectively. This document describes the protocol extensions to disseminate link overload information in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3.</t>
