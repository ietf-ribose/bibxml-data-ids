      <t>This memo outlines requirements guiding the development of a fastMessage Authentication Code (MAC) algorithm suitable for use withmany IETF protocols, but in particular routing protocols that use aMAC for packet authentication.It is widely conjectured that secure MACs that are fast in softwareare possible, and many interesting MACs have appeared in theliterature. Nevertheless, none of these MACs have seen broadadoption, and none are a good match for the routing protocol case.We hope that this memo brings together MAC designers and MAC usersfor a fruitful discussion.</t>
