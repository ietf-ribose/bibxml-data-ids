    <abstract>
      <t>E.164 numbers are often used for fax addresses. Internet fax provides store-and-forward (T.37) and real-time (T.38) modes. Subscribers could use ENUM to store Internet fax preferences in DNS under their fax numbers. Network devices could then query DNS to retrieve that information. An example is subscriber preferences for receiving faxes via Internet mail or SIP delivery. Further work on ENUM for Internet Fax is indicated, one example being H.323 delivery. Policy aspects are out of scope of this draft. This document is not associated with any working group. Comments may be sent to the author.</t>
