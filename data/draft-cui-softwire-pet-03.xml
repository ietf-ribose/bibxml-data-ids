      <t>IPv4 and IPv6 are expected to coexist for a long period. Currently,there are many IPv4/IPv6 transition/coexistence techniques, roughlydivided into the categories of tunneling and translation. Tunnelingand translation have respective application scopes, and translationhas some technical limitations, including scalability issue,application layer translation, operation complexity, etc. To improvethe availability of translation, this draft proposes the method ofselecting appropriate translation spot to execute translation. Whenthe translation spot is not on IPv4-IPv6 border, tunnel is used toachieve the traversing between translation spot and IP border. Thismethod applies well in mesh scenario where both IPv4 and IPv6 clientnetwork exists, and BGP can be extended to achieve a translation spotsignaling.</t>
