    <abstract>
      <t>Market-based allocation of the existing 32-bit address space will offer several advantages as unallocated space becomes scarce. Most importantly, addresses will be allocated to those who value them most. In addition, address allocations will adjust more quickly to changes in network topology or utilization efficiency. A registry will still be required, much like a registry of deeds for real estate, but the registry would no longer make allocation decisions.</t>
