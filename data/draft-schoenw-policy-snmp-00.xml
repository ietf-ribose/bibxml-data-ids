      <t>This memo takes a look at some of the work on policy-driven networks currently being done in several IETF working groups. The proposed solutions (like COPS and PIBs) focus on solving local problems of policy management. It is the view of the authors that while local solutions like COPS can be more effective than more general ones, the advantages to effective management through the use of a single integrated management framework (an improved SNMP) outweigh the gains of locally optimized solutions.</t>
