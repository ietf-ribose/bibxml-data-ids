      <t>This memo takes a look at some of the work on policy-driven networkscurrently being done in several IETF working groups. The proposedsolutions (like COPS and PIBs) focus on solving local problems ofpolicy management. It is the view of the authors that while localsolutions like COPS can be more effective than more general ones, theadvantages to effective management through the use of a singleintegrated management framework (an improved SNMP) outweigh the gainsof locally optimized solutions.</t>
