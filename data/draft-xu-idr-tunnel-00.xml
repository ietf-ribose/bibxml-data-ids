      <t>Virtual Aggregation (VA) is a mechanism for shrinking the size of theDFZ FIB in routers [I-D.francis-idr-intra-va]. VA can result inlonger paths and increased load on routers within the ISP thatdeploys VA. This document describes a mechanism that allows an ASthat originates a route to associate a tunnel endpoint terminating atitself with the route. This allows routers in a remote AS to tunnelpackets to the originating AS. If transit ASes between the remote ASand the originating AS install the prefixes associated with tunnelendpoints in their FIBs, then tunneled packets that transit throughthem will take the shortest path. This results in reduced load forthe transit AS, and better performance for the customers at thesource and destination.</t>
