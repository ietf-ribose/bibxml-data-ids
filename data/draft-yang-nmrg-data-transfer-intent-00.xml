      <t>With the advent of the digital era, there are more and more scenarios such as data off-site AI training, data off-site cloud, and the demand for big data transmission in the WAN is increasing. WAN data transmission involves throughput, delay, packet loss, security and other performance indicators, as well as cost investment. Users have been exploring how to achieve the best performance of data transmission at the lowest cost. This paper implements high quality WAN data transmission based on IBNS.</t>
