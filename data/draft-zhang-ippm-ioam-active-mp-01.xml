    <abstract>
      <t>Active measurements are typically used to collect the information of a specific path. However, when using active measurement mechanisms in a multi-path topology, the default forwarding behavior is to go through one path. So, it cannot collect the information of all the paths at one time. This document extends IOAM Trace Option with a multi-path flag to simplify multi-path IOAM active measurement, which promotes the information collection and topology restoration of a multi-path topology. It can help the operators to know the performance of network comprehensively and efficiently.</t>
