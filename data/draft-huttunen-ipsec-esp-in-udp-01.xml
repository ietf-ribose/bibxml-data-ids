      <t>NAT is widely used for Internet 'connection sharing' and ships as a standard feature in every router and edge device. Cable and DSL deployments have been known to install NAT in embedded devices resident inside the home. Additionally most hotel Internet connections are using NAT. Many airport &amp; wireless services in public areas use NAT to connect to the Internet. Some Internet Service Providers use a centralized NAT to connect their clients to the Internet.</t>
