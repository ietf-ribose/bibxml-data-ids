      <t>A Presence service implemented using SIMPLE has some constraints fordelivering presence information to devices with low data processingcapabilities, small display, and limited battery power. Otherlimitations can be caused by the interface between the terminal andthe network, i.e. if presence information is delivered over radiolinks with high latency and low bandwidth. This memo presentsrequirements for a solution that can aid to reduce the impacts ofthese constrains and helps to increase efficiency.</t>
