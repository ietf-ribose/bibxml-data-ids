      <t>This document describes a profile of the SIP Event Package "kpml"that enables simple monitoring of DTMF signals and uses XML documentsreferred to as Key Press Markup Language (KPML). This profileassumes devices of lesser capability that may have trouble parsingsubscription requests or producing generic XML documents. This is aprofile of RFC 4730, KPML.Conventions used in this documentRFC2119 [1] provides the interpretations for the key words "MUST","MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT","RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" found in this document.The Application Interaction Framework document [9] provides theinterpretations for the terms "User Device", "SIP Application", and"User Input". This document uses the term "Application" and"Requesting Application" interchangeably with "SIP Application".Additionally, the Application Interaction Framework documentdiscusses User Device Proxies. A common instantiation of a UserDevice Proxy is a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) gateway.Because the normative behavior of a presentation free User Interfaceis identical for a presentation free SIP User Agent and apresentation free User Device Proxy, this document uses "User Device"for both cases.</t>
