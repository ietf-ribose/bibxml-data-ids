      <t>This memo describes per-packet stateless strict and loose path steered replication and forwarding for "Bit Index Explicit Replication" (BIER, RFC8279) packets. It is called BIER Tree Engineering (BIER-TE) and is intended to be used as the path steering mechanism for Traffic Engineering with BIER. BIER-TE introduces a new semantic for "bit positions" (BP). They indicate adjacencies of the network topology, as opposed to (non-TE) BIER in which BPs indicate "Bit-Forwarding Egress Routers" (BFER). A BIER-TE packets BitString therefore indicates the edges of the (loop- free) tree that the packet is forwarded across by BIER-TE. BIER-TE can leverage BIER forwarding engines with little changes. Co- existence of BIER and BIER-TE forwarding in the same domain is possible, for example by using separate BIER "sub-domains" (SDs). Except for the optional routed adjacencies, BIER-TE does not require a BIER routing underlay, and can therefore operate without depending on an "Interior Gateway Routing protocol" (IGP). As it operates on the same per-packet stateless forwarding principles, BIER-TE can also be a good fit to support multicast path steering in "Segment Routing" (SR) networks.</t>
