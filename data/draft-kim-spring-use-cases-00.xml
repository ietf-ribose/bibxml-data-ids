      <t>In the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architecture, an SDN controller establishes flow paths. An SDN controller provides global optimization of paths by controlling all managed switches. However, long flow setup time and failure recovery problems arise due to control overhead of an SDN controller. Segment routing provides source routing function by designating an explicit path. SDN and segment routing can be combined to provide both global optimization and better performance. In this document, we illustrate SDN segment routing use cases of flow setup, failure recovery, Content Distribution Network(CDN), and dual homing.</t>
