    <abstract>
      <t>A trusted network path is desired for source authentication and path verification. The emergence of IPv6 Segment Routing (SRv6) may bring the opportunity to assemble trusted network paths with a lightweight IP header. This document describes a trusted network path verification mechanism based on SRv6 (Segment Routing to enable Trusted and Private Network Paths, SR-TPP), which supports network path verification with path information protection. SR-TPP extends SRv6 function in protocol header to meet the requirement of path compliance. Path information is sequentially encoded into the segment list in SR-TPP so that path information is partially visible to each intermediate router. The distributed verification of SR-TPP also makes it easier to locate faults.</t>
