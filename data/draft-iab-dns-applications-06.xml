      <t>A number of Internet applications rely on the Domain Name System (DNS) to support their operations. Many applications use the DNS to locate services for a domain. For example, some applications transform identifiers other than domain names into formats that the DNS can process and then fetch application data or service location data from the DNS. Proposals to incorporate more sophisticated application behavior into the DNS, however, have raised questions about the applicability and extensibility of the DNS. This document explores the architectural consequences of using the DNS for storing and retrieving certain application features, and provides guidance to future application designers as to the sorts of ways that applications can make use of the DNS.</t>
