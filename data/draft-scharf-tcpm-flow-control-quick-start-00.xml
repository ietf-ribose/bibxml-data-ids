      <t>This document describes extensions for the flow control of theTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) that avoid interactions with faststartup congestion control mechanisms, in particular the Quick-StartTCP extension. Quick-Start is an optional TCP extension that allowsto start data transfers with a large congestion window, usingfeedback of the routers along the path. This can avoid the timeconsuming Slow-Start, provided that the TCP flow control is not alimiting factor.There are two potential interactions between the TCP flow control andcongestion control schemes without the standard Slow-Start: First,receivers might not allocate a sufficiently large buffer space afterconnection setup, or they may advertise a receive window implicitlyassuming the Slow-Start behavior on the sender side. This documenttherefore provides guidelines for buffer allocation in hostssupporting the Quick-Start extension. Second, the TCP receive windowscaling mechanism can prevent fast startups immediately after theinitial three-way handshake connection setup. This documentdescribes a simple solution to overcome this problem.</t>
