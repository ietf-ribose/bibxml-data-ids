      <t>This specification defines a set of requirements and facilities designed to improve email confidentiality between a mail user agent (MUA) and a mail submission or mail access server. This provides mechanisms intended to increase use of already deployed Transport Layer Security (TLS) technology and provides a model for a mail user agent's confidentiality assurance. This enables mail service providers to advertise strict transport security (STS) policies that request MUAs increase confidentiality assurance.</t>
