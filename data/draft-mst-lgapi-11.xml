      <t>This document introduces a command set standard to the web-based "Network Looking Glass" software. Its purpose is to provide application programmers uniform access to the Looking Glass service and to analyze a standardized response. The interface is supposed to provide the same level of information as web-based interfaces, but in a computer-readable format.</t>
