    <abstract>
      <t>At the time the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee was set up the Internet Architecture Board had an internal structure significantly different from its current structure. This document aims to update the way in which the ex officio member from the IAB who serves on the IAOC is appointed, in order to better account for that change and better match the skills set out in RFC 4333. After community discussion, it is likely that this document will be split into two distinct parts: one which updates the IAOC membership section of the relevant BCP and another which describes the IAB's program.</t>
