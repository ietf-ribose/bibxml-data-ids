      <t>The Gopher protocol is over twenty years old. Changing practices andunofficial extensions have caused Gopher as currently used to differ,but remain largely compatible with, the standard established in itsofficial governing document, *The Internet Gopher Protocol (adistributed document search and retrieval protocol)*, known as *RFC1436*. Therefore, this document attempts to establish a contemporaryspecification of the Gopher communications protocol, departing aslittle as possible from current practice.</t>
