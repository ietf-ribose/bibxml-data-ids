      <t>This document describes a new RTP header extension. The purpose ofthe extension is to provide an additional information that furtherdistinguishes the RTP datagram (and its payload) from other datagramscontaining the same type of payload. Specifically, a classifierfield is defined in the extension header that contains value such as'emergency'. RTP compliant implementations that do not recognize theclassifier extension header must continue to process the packet andnot take no adverse action. Criteria for inserting the values in theclassifier header, and any QoS treatment of the packet based on thosevalues, is outside the scope of this specification.</t>
