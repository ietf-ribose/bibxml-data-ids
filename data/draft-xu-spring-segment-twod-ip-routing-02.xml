    <abstract>
      <t>Segment Routing (SR) allows a headend node to steer traffic into a Segment Routing Policy (SR Policy), which represents the routing path by matching the destination address and the corresponding Binding Segment Identifier (BSID). However, determining the target SR Policy only based on destination aspect is incapable for demands for higher dimensional routing. Two Dimensional IP (TwoD-IP) routing is an Internet routing architecture that makes forwarding decisions based on source and destination addresses. TwoD-IP routing can easily express a routing policy between host to host, or network to network, and have much lower storage and calculation consumption compared to the higher dimensional routing. In this document, we extend SR to support TwoD-IP routing, illustrate some typical scenarios of SR with TwoD-IP routing to express the advantage of extending SR to support TwoD-IP routing, and describe the mechanism of how TwoD IP routing protocol cooperates with SR.</t>
