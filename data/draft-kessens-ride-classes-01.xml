    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the attributes and classes that will be used in the internet Registry Information Database Exchange formats (RIDE). For now it is mostly limited to 'domain' and 'contact' classes since they were widely considered as most urgent. Encoding that will be used for the objects and ways to find and access objects are beyond the scope of this document. This will be addressed in the future in separate drafts.</t>
