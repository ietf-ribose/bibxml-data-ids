      <t>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv4 (DHCPv4) has beenextended with a Leasequery capability that allows a client to requestinformation about DHCPv4 bindings. That mechanism is limited toqueries for individual bindings. In some situations individualbinding queries may not be efficient, or even possible. In addition,continuous update of an external client with Leasequery data issometimes desired. This document expands on the DHCPv4 Leasequeryprotocol, and allows for active transfer of real-time DHCPv4 addressbinding information data via TCP.</t>
