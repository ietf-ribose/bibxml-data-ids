      <t>This specification defines a framework for SNMPv3 authentication and key distribution with support for various authentication systems such as RADIUS, X.509 certificates, Local Accounts, Kerberos etc. Support for these authentication systems for SNMPv3 allows for a common identity to be used with/shared across all management protocols since the other network management interfaces such as the NetConf protocol and device Command Line Interface (CLI) are already using these authentication systems.</t>
