      <t>With the rapid growth of networks around the globe there is an ever increasing need to improve the energy efficiency of devices. Operators begining to seek more information of power consumption in the network, have no standard mechanism to measure, report and compare power usage of different networking equipment under different network configuration and conditions exist. This document provides suggestions for measuring power usage of live networks under different traffic loads and various switch router configuration settings. It provides a suite which can be deployed on any networking device.</t>
