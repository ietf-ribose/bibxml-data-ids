      <t>The IETF is specifying Proxy Mobile IPv6 for network-based localizedmobility management, which takes basic operation for registration,tunnel management and de-registration into account in a firstprotocol release. This document proposes an extension to ProxyMobile IPv6 to suit MNs, which have multiple network interfacesimplemented and hand over from one network interface to anothernetwork interface while remaining anchored at the same Local MobilityAnchor. This extension avoids that the LMA will prematurely forwarddata packets for the mobile node to the mobile node's new interfacebefore the address configuration of this interface has completed.With the proposed extension, packet buffering at the new MAG is notnecessary and packet losses during an inter-technology handover canbe avoided.</t>
