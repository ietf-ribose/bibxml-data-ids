    <abstract>
      <t>This document gives an overview of the architecture of the L-band Digital Aeronautical Communications System (LDACS), which provides a secure, scalable and spectrum efficient terrestrial data link for civil aviation. LDACS is a scheduled, reliable multi-application cellular broadband system with support for IPv6. LDACS provides a data link for IPv6 network-based aircraft guidance. High reliability and availability for IP connectivity over LDACS, as well as security, are therefore essential.</t>
