      <t>This document describes the Adaptive Mail Delivery Protocol (AMDP). It aims to resolve the problems associated with current email systems that rely on the mail delivery process defined by the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). This is done by extending and designing a backwards-compatible replacement for SMTP, as well as restructuring the mail delivery process. The process is built around an adaptive scheme that is able to addresses current and future demands for a secure and reliable e-mail delivery systems.</t>
