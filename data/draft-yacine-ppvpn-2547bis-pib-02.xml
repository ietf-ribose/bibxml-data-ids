      <t>This document describes a Policy Information Base (PIB) for a device implementing the BGP/MPLS VPN [2547bis] Architecture. The Provisioning Classes defined here provide policy control of resources implementing the BGP/MPLS VPN Architecture. These Provisioning Classes can be used with other non BGP/MPLS VPN Provisioning Classes (defined in other PIBs) to provide for a comprehensive policy controlled mapping of service requirements to device resource capability and usage. The COPS-PR protocol offers significant advantages when dealing with dynamic configuration and when compared to traditional management solutions. Moreover, dynamic VPN resource assignment is crucial to cope with the frequent changes requests from customer's (e.g., sites joining or leaving a VPN), as well as to achieve scalability. The PEs should be able to dynamically assign the VPN resources. This capability is especially important for dial and wireless VPN services.</t>
