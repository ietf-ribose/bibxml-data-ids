      <t>This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The purpose of this extension is to provide an extensible framework for publication of SIP specific data. This extension derives from the recent Internet Draft defining the PUBLISH method, but instead of using the SIP events framework, it introduces a specific publication framework for the publish mechanism. The main motivations for decoupling publications from events are that the event framework is not overloaded, and the applicability of the PUBLISH method to problem sets similar to those surfacing in the publication of event state is improved. The SIP publication framework is neither intended for general data manipulation, nor is it intended to foster any discussion on the issue of using SIP for everything.</t>
