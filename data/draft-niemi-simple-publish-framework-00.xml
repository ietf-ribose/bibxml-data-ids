      <t>This document describes an extension to the Session InitiationProtocol (SIP). The purpose of this extension is to provide anextensible framework for publication of SIP specific data. Thisextension derives from the recent Internet Draft defining the PUBLISHmethod, but instead of using the SIP events framework, it introducesa specific publication framework for the publish mechanism. The mainmotivations for decoupling publications from events are that theevent framework is not overloaded, and the applicability of thePUBLISH method to problem sets similar to those surfacing in thepublication of event state is improved. The SIP publicationframework is neither intended for general data manipulation, nor isit intended to foster any discussion on the issue of using SIP foreverything.</t>
