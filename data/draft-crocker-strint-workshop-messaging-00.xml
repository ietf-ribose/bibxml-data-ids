      <t>Given a concern for pervasive monitoring, messaging information needing protection includes primary payload, descriptive meta-data, and traffic-related analysis. Complete protection against pervasive monitoring (PM), for traffic through complex handling sequences, has not yet been achieved reliably in real-world operation. Consequently, it is reasonable to consider a range of mechanisms, for protecting differing amounts of information and against monitoring of different kinds. Although channel-based encryption can be helpful, it is not sufficient. This paper considers pursuing different levels of end-to-end protection, referencing examples of component mechanisms that already have encouraging field experience.</t>
