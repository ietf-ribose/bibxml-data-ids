      <t>This document specifies a protocol for alerting a dormant mode host of incoming packets. A unique characteristic of the proposed protocol is that its major operations, namely, paging registration, monitoring and capturing of paging triggering packets, and initiation of the paging operation, are performed primarily in a last-hop subnet (i.e., the edge subnet to which the host is connected before entering dormant mode). The proposed protocol conforms with the DMHA (Dormant Mode Host Alerting) protocol requirements discussed in the IETF Seamoby WG.</t>
