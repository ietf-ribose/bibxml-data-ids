      <t>Consider a situation which will arise in many IPv6 transitionscenarios, where Network A, to which a host is attached, supports oneIP version, but the host and Network B support a different IPversion. Suppose that the host wishes to access a multicast groupwhich is rooted or sourced in Network B. This document specifies anapproach that combines stateful translation for signalling,encapsulation of multicast content moving between Network B and thehost, and native multicast routing in Network A to provide the hostwith its desired access.</t>
