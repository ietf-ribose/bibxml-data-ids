      <t>This document specifies a NAT44 operation model where externalports are pre-allocated per subscriber. The NAT44 function isdeployed in carrier's networks also known as CGN. Three new RADIUSattributes are proposed to support that operation forconfiguration and billing purpose. Translation logging on aNAT44 device is significantly reduced with this operational model.</t>
