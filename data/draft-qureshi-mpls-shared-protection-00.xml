      <t>This document discusses the shared mesh protection concept. Its aim is to provide fast, guaranteed recovery of service at significantly less cost of protection capacity compared to other schemes. In companion documents [1,2], extensions to RSVP-TE and OSPF-TE protocols are proposed that enable shared mesh protection. Those extensions, together with this document, first address global repair with path-based protection switching, as opposed to local repair of LSP failures and reroute. However, the concept can be extended straightforwardly to the local repair techniques being considered in the MPLS working group.</t>
