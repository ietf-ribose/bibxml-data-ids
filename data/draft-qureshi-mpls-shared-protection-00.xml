      <t>This document discusses the shared mesh protection concept. Its aimis to provide fast, guaranteed recovery of service at significantlyless cost of protection capacity compared to other schemes. Incompanion documents [1,2], extensions to RSVP-TE and OSPF-TEprotocols are proposed that enable shared mesh protection. Thoseextensions, together with this document, first address global repairwith path-based protection switching, as opposed to local repair ofLSP failures and reroute. However, the concept can be extendedstraightforwardly to the local repair techniques being considered inthe MPLS working group.</t>
