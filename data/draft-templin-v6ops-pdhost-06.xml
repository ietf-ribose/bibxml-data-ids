      <t>IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which then use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks. This document considers both this traditional case, and the case when the "requesting router" is actually a simple host which receives a delegated prefix that it can use for its own internal multi- addressing purposes. This latter method can be employed in a wide variety of use cases to allow ample address availability without impacting link performance.</t>
