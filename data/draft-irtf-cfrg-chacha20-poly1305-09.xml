      <t>This document defines the ChaCha20 stream cipher, as well as the use of the Poly1305 authenticator, both as stand-alone algorithms, and as a "combined mode", or Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD) algorithm. This document does not introduce any new crypto, but is meant to serve as a stable reference and an implementation guide. It is a product of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG)</t>
