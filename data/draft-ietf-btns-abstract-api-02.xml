    <abstract>
      <t>This document explains in the abstract (no language bindings are provided) how an application may learn that IPsec has been applied to a conversation or specify that IPsec should be used. Though this is useful in general it is particularly useful for applications that wish to use BTNS (Better Than Nothing Security -- a mode of IPsec keying), either in conjunction with channel binding or otherwise.</t>
