    <abstract>
      <t>This document explains in the abstract (no language bindings areprovided) how an application may learn that IPsec has been applied toa conversation or specify that IPsec should be used. Though this isuseful in general it is particularly useful for applications thatwish to use BTNS (Better Than Nothing Security -- a mode of IPseckeying), either in conjunction with channel binding or otherwise.</t>
