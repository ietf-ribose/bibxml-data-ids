      <t>This document introduces a dynamic secondary routing structure with the destination address and subnet mask as the first index and DSCP value as the second. DSCP values of various applications are extracted and packets are forwarded in accordance with them. Therefore, applications with different demands of Quality of Service (QoS) can be served accordingly, which can promote the quality of transmission and finally achieve differentiated services.</t>
