      <t>When a 'NAT traversal' capability is added to a class of signalingprotocols which can control some traffic aggregation points, anattack based on a temporary access to the path followed by messagesexists.Mobile IP [1] with NAT traversal [5] or IKE [2] with NATtraversal [6], including the IKEv2 [7] proposal, are potentiallyaffected by this kind of attacks.This document claims this vulnerability is an intrinsic propertyof the NAT traversal capability, so is another point where theusage of NATs is very damaging.</t>
