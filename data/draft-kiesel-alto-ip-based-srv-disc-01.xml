      <t>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates capable of providing a desired resource. ALTO is realized by a client-server protocol. This document establishes a well-known IP address for the ALTO service and specifies how ALTO clients embedded in the resource consumer can use it to access the ALTO service.</t>
