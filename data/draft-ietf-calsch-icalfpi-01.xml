      <t>The IETF has defined a standard format for exchanging calendaring and scheduling data, called iCalendar. This format is useful for exchange of personal calendar data across the Internet, as well as in non- Internet environments. In a number of environments where the iCalendar will be used, the format type and version needs to be identified. For example, when registering the iCalendar as a format for memory-based 'clipboard' or 'drag/drop' user interface interactions. For these cases, a definitive formal public identifier (FPI) for the iCalendar will be required. This memo defined the FPI to be used when referring to the version 2.0 (the value in the 'VERSION' property) of the iCalendar format.</t>
