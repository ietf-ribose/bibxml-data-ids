      <t>Consider a situation where a subscriber's packets are subject to two levels of NAT, with both NATs operating under the control of the ISP. An example of this would be a NATing Home Gateway forwarding packets to a Large Scale NAT. This memo proposes that advantage be taken of the presence of the second NAT, to offload the burden on the Large Scale NAT by delegation to the Home Gateway. Enhancements to the Port Control Protocol are specified to achieve this. The proposed solution applies also for DS-Lite where the AFTR offloads it NAT to the B4 element.</t>
