      <t>This document defines an Internet PKI Certificate Request Syntax (CRS).It addresses a growing need within the Internet PKI community for aninterface to public key certification products and services based onPKCS7 [PKCS7] and PKCS10 [PKCS10]. A small number of additional servicesare defined to supplement the core certificate request service. Currentindustry practice regarding the use of PKCS7 and PKCS10 is alsodocumented for the benefit of the Internet community. In general, the use of PKCS7 in this document is aligned to theCryptographic Message Syntax [CMS] which provides a superset of thePKCS7 syntax. Throughout this document, the term CMS should be taken toinclude the PKCS #7 document as defined in [PKCS7]. The term CRS refersto this specification. The chief differences between CRS and PKIXMGMT are: - Use of PKCS7 for security encapsulation and transaction framework- Use of PKCS10 as the certification request message content- Certification of Diffie-Hellman Public Keys based on PKCS10 requests- No assumption of reliable connectivity or persistent on-line operation- Single request/response transaction model</t>
