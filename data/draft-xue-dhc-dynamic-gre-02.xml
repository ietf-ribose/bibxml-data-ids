      <t>Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) is regarded as a popular encapsulation tunnel technology because of simpleness and easy implementation. When a node tries to encapsulate the user traffic in a GRE tunnel, it needs to first obtain the IP address of the destination node which need to decapsulate the GRE packets. In practice, the GRE tunnel destination IP address may be manually configured. This configuration introduces efficiency issues for operators, especially, in the scenarios where there are a large number entities need to deploy GRE tunnels. This work proposes an approach to configure the GRE information dynamiclly.</t>
