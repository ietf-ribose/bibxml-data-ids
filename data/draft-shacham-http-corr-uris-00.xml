      <t>A large amount of email is non-personal, automated communication, such as newsletters, confirmations and legitimate advertisements. These are often tagged as spam by content filters. This type of correspondence is usually initiated by a transaction over the web, such as a purchase or signing up for a service. Therefore, we propose a new HTTP header to carry the addresses that may be used by the provider to correspond with the user. These may be email addresses, or those used in other protocols, such as SIP. This will facilitate the automatic inclusion of these addresses in whitelists used for spam prevention.</t>
