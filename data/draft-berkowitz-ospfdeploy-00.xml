      <t>OSPF is the preferred interior routing protocol of the Internet. It isa complex protocol intended to deal with complex networks. While it isa powerful mechanism, it does not handle all situations, and itsappropriate use may not be obvious to beginners. Standards track documentsdeal with protocol design, but deployment of OSPF in many enterprisenetworks has been limited by lack of information on best current practiceinformation for interior routing. Best Current Practices documents havefocused on general exterior connectivity. This memorandum is intended tocomplement the protocol specification by describing the experience-based,vendor-independent techniques of OSPF and complementary technologies inrepresentative networks. Better understanding of the use of OSPF featuresto help exterior connectivity will help reduce the demand for complex userBGP configuration.</t>
