      <t>This document obsoletes RFC 6761 that created the Special-Use Domain Names registry at IANA for domain names that are reserved for special use. The registry has proved to be useful. RFC 6761 also has a description for when reserving such a name is appropriate, and the procedure for doing so; those descriptions have turned out to cause many problems in the IETF. Because of those problems, this document obsoletes RFC 6761 while retaining the registry and greatly reducing the rest of the discussion and requirements in RFC 6761. It places the responsibility for accepting Special-Use Domain Names entries with the IESG.
