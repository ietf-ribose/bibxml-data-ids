      <t>This note proposes an address and service architecture designed tofacilitate transition from an IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 Internet.This service contains three parts: A DNS Application Layer Gateway, astateful Network Address Translator that enables IPv6 clients toinitiate connections to IPv4 servers and peers, and a statelessNetwork Address Translator that enables IPv4 and IPv6 systems tointeroperate freely.It is couched as an update to RFCs 2765 and 2766. This is becausethe stateless service is essentially the SIIT with a differentaddress format, and because the DNS Application Layer Gateway and thestateful translator have significant similarities to NAT-PT. Thereare, however, important differences from NAT-PT, responsive to theissues raised in RFC 4966.</t>
