      <t>ACME is a critical protocol for accelerating HTTPS adoption on the Internet, automating digital certificate issuing for web servers. Because RFC 8555 assumes that both sides (client and server) support the primary cryptographic algorithms necessary for the certificate, ACME does not include algorithm negotiation procedures. However, in light of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), many signature algorithm alternatives can be used, allowing for different trade-offs (e.g., signature vs. public key size). In addition, alternative PQC migration strategies exist, such as KEMTLS, which employs KEM public keys for authentication. This document describes an algorithm negotiation mechanism for ACME. The negotiation allows different strategies and provides KEMTLS certificate issuing capabilities.</t>
