      <t>Current efforts in the scope of Network Function Virtualisation(NFV) propose YAML-based descriptors for Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) and for their composition in Network Services (NS) These descriptors are human-readable but hardly understandable by humans. On the other hand, there has been an effort proposed to the IETF to define a human-readable (and understandable) representation for networks, known as NEMO. In this draft, we propose a simple extension to NEMO to accommodate VNF Descriptors (VNFDs) in a similar manner as inline assembly is integrated in higher-level programming languages. This approach enables the creation of recursive VNF forwarding graphs in Service Descriptors, practically making them recursive.</t>
