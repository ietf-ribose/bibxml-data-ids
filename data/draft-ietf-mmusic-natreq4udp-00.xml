      <t>During the next few years, as the IPv4 address space moves toward exhaustion, it is likely that the deployment of NAT will accelerate. This draft presents the requirements that NAT devices must meet in order to enable use of UDP by peer-to-peer applications. The requirement can be summed up by the need to avoid gratuitous filtering and too short timers.</t>
