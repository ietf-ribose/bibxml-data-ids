      <t>This document describes the details of the PIM-SM [1,2,3] version 2 implementation for UNIX platforms; namely SunOS and SGI-IRIX. A generic kernel model is adopted, which is protocol independent, however some supporting functions are added to the kernel for encapsulation of data packets at user level and decapsulation of PIM Registers. Further, the basic model for the user level, PIM daemon (pimd), implementation is described. Implementation details and code are included in supplementary appendices.</t>
