      <t>This document describes how the SIP Instance ID as defined in RFC 5626 [1] is used by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), for Push-to-talk over Cellular (PoC) and Push-to-Communicate for Public Safety (PCPS) and addresses security concerns with use of the SIP instance ID in non-register requests and responses. This document updates RFC 7255 [2] to allow the use of the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) as an instance ID in the Contact header field of non-register requests and responses by the OMA PoC and PCPS enablers for the purposes described in this document.</t>
