      <t>This document presents a new perspective for the solution design of enhanced mobility anchoring in a distributed mobility management deployment. Mobility anchor function is composed of forwarding statement management and forwarding path management functions. In this draft, enhanced mobility anchoring solution design is discussed in the two cases: co-located forwarding state and path management functions on the same network entity and separated forwarding state and path management functions on different network entities.</t>
