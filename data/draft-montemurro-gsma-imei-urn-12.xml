    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name namespace for the GSMA (GSM Association)and a sub-namespace for the IMEI (International Mobile station Equipment Identity), and associated parameter for the IMEISV (International Mobile station Equipment Identity and Software Version number). The IMEI is 15 decimal digits long and the IMEISV is 16 decimal digits long and both are encoded using Binary Encoded Decimal (BCD). The IMEI and IMEISV were introduced as part of the specification for Global System for Mobile communications(GSM) and are also now incorporated by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as part of the 3GPP specification for GSM, the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) and 3GPP LTE (Long Term Evolution). The IMEI and IMEISV are used to uniquely identify Mobile Equipment within these systems and are managed by the GSMA.</t>
