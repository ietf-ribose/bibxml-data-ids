      <t>This document discusses the existing inadequacies in the handling of security issues within the NFSv4 protocols and the steps that might be taken to correct the situation, including the preparation of new standards-track documents updating existing ones. Because the security approach has been and should remain the same for all minor versions, it is expected that security for all the NFSv4 protocols will be addressed together in a single NFSv4-wide standards-track document.</t>
