      <t>This specification defines generalized primitives for use in establishing end-to-end confidentiality in multiparty communications. These primitives address three essential elements of group privacy: authentication, group membership, and secure key exchange. The purpose is to define these primitives in such a way as they may be leveraged as common constructs within new and existing secure group communications protocols, and in support of both centralized and decentralized architectures.</t>
