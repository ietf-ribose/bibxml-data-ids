      <t>The Network Data Management Protocol (NDMP) defines a mechanism and protocol for controlling backup, recovery, and other transfers of data between primary and secondary storage. The NDMP architecture separates the network attached Data Management Application (DMA), Data Servers and Tape Servers participating in archival or recovery operations. NDMP also provides low-level control of tape devices and SCSI media changers. The XDR and TCP/IP protocols are foundations for NDMP. The key goals of NDMP include interoperability, contemporary functionality, and extensibility. The XDR and TCP/IP protocols are foundations for NDMP.
