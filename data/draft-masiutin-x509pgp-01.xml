      <t>There were currently no described provisions to convert from an X.509v3 certificate to a PGP Certificate and vice versa because of format of data being signed differ in these two standards. This document defines a new X.509v3 certificate extension called pgpKey that holds a verbatim PGP Certificate, making such conversion possible.
