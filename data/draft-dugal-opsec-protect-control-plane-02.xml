      <t>This memo provides a method for protecting a router's control plane from undesired or malicious traffic. In this approach, all legitimate control plane traffic is identifed. Once legitimate traffic has been identified, a filter is deployed on the router's forwarding plane. That filter prevents traffic not specifically identified as legitimate from reaching the router's control plane.</t>
