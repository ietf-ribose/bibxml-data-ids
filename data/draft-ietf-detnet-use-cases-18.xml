      <t>This draft documents use cases in several diverse industries to establish multi-hop paths for characterized flows with deterministic properties. In this context deterministic implies that flows can be established which provide guaranteed bandwidth and latency which can be established from either a Layer 2 or Layer 3 (IP) interface, and which can co-exist on an IP network with best-effort traffic. Additional use case properties include optional redundant paths, very high reliability paths, time synchronization, and clock distribution. Industries considered include professional audio, electrical utilities, building automation systems, wireless for industrial, cellular radio, industrial machine-to-machine, mining, private blockchain, and network slicing. For each case, this document will identify the application, identify representative solutions used today, and the improvements IETF DetNet solutions may enable.</t>
