      <t>This Internet Draft describes a framework, consistent with the model definedin the PINT group in the IETF, for controlling voice and voice-band data(e.g., FAX) calls on the PSTN from an IP Client. As such, it is solelyconcerned with call control and associated functions. It is not concernedwith how to convert packetized voice into a form suitable for carriage overthe PSTN. We introduce a logical entity (called CallBroker) that initiates and managescalls on the PSTN and controls the session on behalf of an IP Client toestablish a telephone connection between two or more end points specified bythe customer (i.e., IP Client). By way of this session, as mediated by theCall Broker, the customer can set up calls and receive notificationsregarding the status of the calls and its participants. The interface between the CallBroker and the Service Control Function (asdefined in the work on Intelligent Network Standards in ITU-T) in theService Node (SN) in the PSTN will be defined and standardized as part ofthis activity. The interface between the IP client and the CallBroker alsonees to be defined and standardized as part of this activity. This Internet Draft further advances the discussion on the issues involved in interconnecting the Internet and the Public Switched Telephone Networks (PSTNs), focusing on potential interfaces between Internet-based entitiesand Intelligent Network (I.N.) entities. The services identified anddiscussed earlier (e.g., Click-to-Dial, Click-to-FAX, etc.) can be provided using the architecture identified here.</t>
