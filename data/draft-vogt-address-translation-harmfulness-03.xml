      <t>Address translation is widely considered harmful because it conflictswith design principles highly regarded within the Internetengineering community. Still, address translation has become commonpractice despite technical problems because it constitutes an easy-to-deploy solution to a set of common operational needs. Since someof these needs will continue to exist in IP version 6, there isconcern within the Internet engineering community about the potentialproliferation of harmful technology from IP version 4 to IP version6. This document investigates this concern. It compares feasibleaddress translator designs with respect to the harmful impact theymay have, explains why the problems of address translation, as usedtoday, are to a significant extent entailed by the shortage of globaladdresses in IP version 4, and shows how the problems can bemitigated in IP version 6.</t>
