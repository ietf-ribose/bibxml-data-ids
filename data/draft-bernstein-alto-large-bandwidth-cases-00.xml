      <t>This draft describes two generic use-cases that illustrate application layer traffic optimization concepts applied to high bandwidth core networks. For the purposes here high bandwidth will mean bandwidth that is significant with respect to the capacity of a wavelength in a wavelength division multiplexed optical transport system, e.g., 10-40Gbps or more. For each of these generic use cases, we present a generic optimization problem, look at the type of information needed (query interface) to perform the optimization, investigate a reservation interface to request network resources, and also consider enhanced availability and recovery scenarios.</t>
