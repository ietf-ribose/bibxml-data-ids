      <t>RFC 2119 defines words that are used in IETF standards documents toindicate standards compliance. These words are fine for defining newprotocols, but there are certain deficiencies in using them when itcomes to protocol maintainability. Protocols are maintained byeither updating the core specifications or via changes in protocolregistries.For example, security functionality in protocols often relies uponcryptographic algorithms that are defined in external documents.Cryptographic algorithms have a limited life span, and new algorithmsregularly phased in to replace older algorithms.This document proposes standard terms to use in protocol registriesand possibly in standards track and informational documents toindicate the life cycle support of protocol features and operations.</t>
