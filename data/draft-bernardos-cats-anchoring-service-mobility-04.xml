    <abstract>
      <t>The IETF CATS WG addresses the problem of how the network infrastructure can steer traffic between clients of a service and sites offering the service, considering both network metrics (such as bandwidth and latency), and compute metrics (such as processing, storage capabilities, and capacity). This document defines new extensions and procedures for a terminal connected to a network infrastructure, to benefit from transparent service migration adapting to specific connectivity and computing requirements, so traffic is always steered to an instance meeting both requirements. Both CATS-aware and -unaware terminals are considered. Exemplary signaling control messages and operation extending the well-known Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol are also defined.</t>
