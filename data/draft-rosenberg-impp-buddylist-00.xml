      <t>This document defines an XML format for a buddy list, which represents a list of other users a particular user would like to subscribe to. When a presence client starts up, it needs to initiate subscriptions to the users on the buddy list. By keeping this list in a standard XML format, the list can be stored locally, or retrieved remotely using HTTP or any other transfer protocol. The great advantage of storing it remotely is that a user can move from machine to machine, fetch their buddy list from a home server, and then subscribe to those users. This provides personal mobility for presence services.</t>
