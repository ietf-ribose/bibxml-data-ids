      <t>This document defines an XML format for a buddy list, whichrepresents a list of other users a particular user would like tosubscribe to. When a presence client starts up, it needs to initiatesubscriptions to the users on the buddy list. By keeping this list ina standard XML format, the list can be stored locally, or retrievedremotely using HTTP or any other transfer protocol. The greatadvantage of storing it remotely is that a user can move from machineto machine, fetch their buddy list from a home server, and thensubscribe to those users. This provides personal mobility forpresence services.</t>
