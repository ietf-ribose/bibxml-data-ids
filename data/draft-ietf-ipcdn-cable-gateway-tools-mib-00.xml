      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP- based management of CableHome compliant WAN Gateway Devices and home routers. Specifically, this MIB defines managed objects for both a connection speed tool and an ICMP 'ping' tool between the Gateway and devices on the LAN. This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7]. The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.</t>
