    <abstract>
      <t>As OTN network capabilities continue to evolve, there is an increased need to support GMPLS control for the same. [RFC4328] introduced GMPLS signaling extensions for supporting early version of G.709 [G.709-v1].The basic routing considerations from signaling perspective is also specified in [RFC4328]. The recent revision of ITU-T Recommendation G.709 [G.709-v3] and [GSUP.43] have introduced new ODU containers (both fixed and flexible) and additional ODU multiplexing capabilities, enabling support for optimal service aggregation. This document extends [RFC4328] to provide GMPLS signaling support for the new OTN capabilities defined in [G.709-v3] and [GSUP.43]. The signaling extensions described in this document caters to ODU layer switching only. Optical Channel Layer switching considerations in [RFC4328] are not modified in this document.</t>
