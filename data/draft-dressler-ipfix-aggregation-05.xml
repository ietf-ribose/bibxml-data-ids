      <t>IPFIX Flow Aggregation describes a methodology for reducing theamount of measurement data exchanged between monitoring devices(IPFIX Exporters) and analyzers (IPFIX Collectors). Aggregationtechniques represent a necessary enhancement in order to cope withincreasing amounts of monitoring data that accrue with the ever-growing network capacities. Using Flow Selection Criteria andCompound Flow creation techniques, measurement information ofmultiple Flows that are sharing some common criteria is merged to beexported in one Compound Flow. Subsets of Flows eligible foraggregation, as well as the desired degree of similarity, can becustomized using a set of Aggregation Rules.</t>
