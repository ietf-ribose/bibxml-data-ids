      <t>ANSI Standard X3.218-1993 (HIPPI-LE[3]) defines the encapsulation of IEEE 802.2 LLC PDUs and, by implication, IP on HIPPI. ANSI X3.222-1993 (HIPPI-SC[4]) describes the operation of HIPPI physical switches. The ANSI committee responsible for these standards chose to leave HIPPI networking issues largely outside the scope of their standards; this document describes one aspect of the use of HIPPI switches as IP local area networks. This draft is part of a split of RFC 1374, 'IP and ARP on HIPPI'. RFC 1374 has been a Proposed Standard since November, 1992, with at least 10 implementations of IP encapsulation and HIPPI switch discipline. No major changes to it are required. However, the ARP part of RFC 1374 has not had sufficient implementation experience to be advanced to Draft Standard. The present document contains the ARP material; the rest is retained in a separate document that is intended to remain on the standards track.</t>
