    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a mechanism, referred to as "service mapping", to express association of overlay routes with underlay routes satisfying a certain SLA, using BGP. The document describes a framework for classifying underlay routes into transport classes, and mapping service routes to specific transport class. The transport class maps to a desired SLA. It specifies BGP protocol procedures that enable dissimination of such service mapping information that may span multiple co-operating administrative domains. These domains may be administetered by the same provider or closely co-ordinating provider networks. It makes it possible to advertise multiple tunnels to the same destination address, thus avoiding need of multiple loopbacks on the egress node. A new BGP transport layer address family (SAFI 76) is defined for this purpose that uses RFC-4364 technology and follows RFC-8277 NLRI encoding. This new address family is called "BGP Classful Transport", aka BGP CT. It carries transport prefixes across tunnel domain boundaries (e.g. in Inter-AS Option-C networks), parallel to BGP LU (SAFI 4). It dissiminates "Transport class" information for the transport prefixes across the participating domains, which is not possible with BGP LU. This makes the end-to-end network a "Transport Class" aware tunneled network.</t>
