      <t>The IPv4 main header contained a 16-bit IP Identification (IPID) fieldused for fragmentation and reassembly. In practice, this fieldwas commonly used by network diagnosticians for tracking packets. InIPv6, the IPID has been moved to the Fragment header, and would onlybe used when fragmentation is required. Thus, the IPID field in IPv6,is no longer able to be utilized in the valuable role it played inIPv4, relative to diagnostics and problem resolution. This causesgreat concern in particular for end users and large enterprises, forwhom Network/Application availability and performance can directly andprofoundly affect bottom line financials. Several viable solutions tothis situation exist.</t>
