      <t>When running a multi-level multicast routing protocol, upper levels need to know about group memberships in lower levels in a protocol- independent fashion. Domain Wide Multicast Group Membership Reports allow this information to be learned in a fashion similar to IGMP[Fenn97] at the domain level. This document is a product of the IDMR working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at idmr@cs.ucl.ac.uk and/or the author.</t>
