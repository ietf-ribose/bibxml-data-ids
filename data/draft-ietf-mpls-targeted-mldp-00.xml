      <t>Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) can be used to set up Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) and Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths. The existing specification for this functionality assumes that a pair of LDP neighbors are directly connected. However, the LDP base specification allows for the case where a pair of LDP neighbors are not directly connected; the LDP session between such a pair of neighbors is known as a "Targeted LDP" session. This document provides the specification for using the LDP P2MP/MP2MP extensions over a Targeted LDP session.</t>
