      <t>Network File System version 4.2 (NFSv4.2) clients commonly cache directory entries (dirents) to improve performance. While effective in many cases, such caching can prevent servers from enforcing per- user access controls on directory entries and up-to-date directory entry attributes such as size and timestamps. This document introduces a new uncacheable dirent metadata attribute for NFSv4.2 that allows servers to advise clients that caching of directory entry metadata is unsuitable. This enables servers to present directory contents based on user-specific access permissions while remaining compatible with existing NFSv4.2 clients.</t>
