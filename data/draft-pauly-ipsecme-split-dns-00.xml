      <t>This document defines two new Configuration Payload Attribute Types for the IKEv2 protocol that together define a set of private DNS domains which should be resolved by DNS servers reachable through an IPsec connection, while leaving all other DNS resolution unchanged. This allows for split-DNS views for multiple domains and includes support for private DNSSEC trust anchors. The information obtained via the new attribute types can be used to reconfigure a locally running DNS server with DNS forwarding for specific private domains.</t>
