      <t>Concerns about the growth of the global routing table has led toproposals for short-term FIB-reduction and long-term RIB-reductionsolutions. The simplest type of FIB-reduction solution is "FIBaggregation", whereby individual routers locally reduce the FIB sizewithout any changes to external operation. The draft[I-D.zhang-fibaggregation] describes and analyzes several FIBaggregation schemes. This current draft describes and analyzesanother point in the design space, called SMALTA. Compared to theapproaches in [I-D.zhang-fibaggregation], SMALTA provides betteraggregation and does not introduce non-routable entries in the FIB,but is also more complex.</t>
