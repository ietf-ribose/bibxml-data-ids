      <t>This document describes a key management protocol for a mobile computer to securely obtain keying material with an access router in a visited link for use as the local binding security association with the router. The protocol enables an IPv6 node to utilize the access router as its temporary home agent and continue to receive packets destined to its care-of address with the temporary home agent as well as to send packets from this care-of address when the nodes change its access router. To support this operation, two new types of mobility headers and one Neighbor Discovery option are defined. All IPv6 nodes MAY support this protocol.</t>
