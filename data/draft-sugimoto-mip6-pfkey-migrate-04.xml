      <t>This document describes the need for an interface between Mobile IPv6and IPsec/IKE and show how the two protocols can interwork. Wepropose a set of extensions to the PF_KEY framework which allowssmooth and solid operation of IKE in a Mobile IPv6 environment. Thefirst extension is called PF_KEY MIGRATE and is for migrating theendpoint addresses of a IPsec Security Association pair in tunnelmode. The second extension is named SADB_X_EXT_PACKET and allows IKEto make the right choice for address selection in bootstrappingprocess. Both extensions are helpful for assuring smoothinterworking between Mobile IPv6 and IPsec/IKE and achievingperformance optimization.</t>
