    <abstract>
      <t>The two key issues of today's Internet are autonomy and extensibility. Autonomous Internet(AIP) technology can provide extensible internet architecture, own independent root DNS servers and self management internet network; Furthermore, based on the Autonomous Internet, here provides a way with extensible address capacity to solve IP address deficiency and realize Autonomous Extensible Internet(AEIP). It mainly adopts local network address based on per Autonomous IP network and uses bilateral dynamic NAT with global network address between Autonomous IP networks to solve IP address deficient problem. This AEIP with Network Address Translation(AEIP NAT) can realize autonomy and extensibility with minimal cost.</t>
