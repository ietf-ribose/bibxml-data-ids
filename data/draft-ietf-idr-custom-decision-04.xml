      <t>The BGP specification defines a Decision Process for installation of routes into the Loc-RIB. This process takes into account an extensive series of path attributes, which can be manipulated to indicate preference for specific paths. It is cumbersome (if at all possible) for the end user to define policies that will select, after partial comparison, a path based on subjective local (domain and/or node) criteria. This document defines a new Extended Community, called the Cost Community, which may be used in tie breaking during the best path selection process. The end result is a local custom decision process.</t>
