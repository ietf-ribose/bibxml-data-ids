      <t>This memo provides a simple analysis for the address utilization in the MASC architecture and concludes that the number of levels in the hierarchy should be kept small. More specifically, we believe that the number of levels should not exceed 3 MASC levels. The memo also motivates that MASC should not rely on hints from applications for future address requirements, but should rather guess future address demand and allocate addresses pro-actively thereby reducing the latency for address requests.</t>
