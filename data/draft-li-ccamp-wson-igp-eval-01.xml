    <abstract>
      <t>Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is a technology for optical communications, in which the user traffic is carried by data channels of different optical wavelengths. In traditional WDM Networks, each wavelength path is statically configured. With the deployment of the Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) and the Wavelength Selective Switch (WSS), WDM networks have become more dynamic, and operators can flexibly set up wavelength paths to carry user traffic. This document discusses the set of Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) requirements that would enable distributed light path computation in Wavelength Switched Optical Networks (WSON). An IGP impact analysis is also provided. According to the analysis, there is no significant impact on the IGP performance.</t>
