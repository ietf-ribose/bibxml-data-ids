    <abstract>
      <t>Work on the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)( [RFC4033] et al) has been in progress for close to 15 years and DNSSEC is still not "mature" enough to be considered complete. A substantial issue is the complexity of the system. This document describes a simplified version of DNSSEC that can co-exist with the current protocols, but with characteristics such that the author believes it can be implemented and deployed with much less effort.</t>
