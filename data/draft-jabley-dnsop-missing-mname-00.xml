      <t>The Start of Authority (SOA) Resource Record (RR) in the Domain NameSystem (DNS) specifies various parameters related to the handling ofdata in DNS zones. These parameters are variously used by authority-only servers, caching resolvers and DNS clients to guide them in theway that data contained within particular zones should be used.One particular field in the SOA RR is known as MNAME, which is usedto specify the "Primary Master" server for a zone. This is theserver to which Dynamic Updates are sent by clients. Many zones donot accept updates using the Dynamic Update mechanism, and any suchDNS UPDATE messages which are received provide no usual purpose. Forsuch zones it may be preferable not to receive updates from clientsat all.This document proposes a convention by which a zone operator cansignal to clients that a particular zone does not accept DynamicUpdates.</t>
