    <abstract>
      <t>This memo proposes an architecture for extending RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) with a new RTCP Extended Reports (XR) (RFC3611) block type to report new metrics regarding media transmission or reception quality, following RTCP guidelines established in RFC5968. This memo suggests that a new block should contain a single metric or a small number of metrics relevant to a single parameter of interest or concern, rather than containing a number of metrics which attempt to provide full coverage of all those parameters of concern to a specific application. Applications may then "mix and match" to create a set of blocks which covers their set of concerns. Where possible, a specific block should be designed to be re-usable across more than one application, for example, for all of voice, streaming audio and video.</t>
