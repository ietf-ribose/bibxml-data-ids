      <t>This draft presents the transitional phases that optical network connection operations undergo, providing high-level processes and states of the connection operations. A list of potential parameters associated with the connection operations signaling protocol is provided. The list of parameters is not an exhaustive list; it should be used as a basis for more comprehensive parameters for the signaling mechanism.</t>
