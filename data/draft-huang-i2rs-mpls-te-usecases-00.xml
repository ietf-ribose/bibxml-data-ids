      <t>An MPLS Traffic Engineering(TE) network is typically configured and results of its operation are analyzed by Command Line Interface (CLI), SNMP or NETCONF. These interactions to control MPLS TE and diagnose its operation encompass: MPLS TE configuration, MPLS TE protection, traffic switching-over, monitoring of MPLS TE and fault detection. Interface to the Routing System's (I2RS) Programmatic interfaces, as defined in [I-D.ward-i2rs-framework], provides an alternate way to control the configuration and diagnose the operation of MPLS TE. I2RS may be used for the configuration, manipulation, polling or analyzing MPLS TE. This document describes set of use cases for which I2RS can be used for MPLS TE. It is intended to provide a base for the solution draft describing a set of interfaces to MPLS TE.</t>
