      <t>This document discusses some security issues associated with IP over ATM operation. RFC1577 defines the Classic IP model for sending IP traffic over ATM. However, security issues were not addressed in the standard. Since internet is an open architecture, security measures to protect network integrity are essential for normal operation. The security loopholes in the current RFC 1577 model are analyzed and discussed. Possible solutions are proposed.</t>
