      <t>This document defines extensions to One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP), and Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) to implement performance measurement on every member link of a Link Aggregation Group (LAG). Knowing the measured metrics of each member link of a LAG enables operators to enforce a performance metric-based traffic steering policy across the member links.</t>
