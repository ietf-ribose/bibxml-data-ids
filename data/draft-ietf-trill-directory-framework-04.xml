      <t>Edge RBridges currently learn the mapping between MAC addresses and their egress RBridges by observing the data packets they ingress or egress or by the TRILL ESADI protocol. When an ingress RBridge receives a data frame whose destination address (MAC&amp;VLAN) that RBridge does not know, the data frame is flooded within the VLAN across the TRILL campus. This document describes the framework for using directory services to assist edge RBridges in reducing multi-destination frames, particularly unknown unicast frames flooding, and ARP/ND, thus improving TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) network scalability.</t>
