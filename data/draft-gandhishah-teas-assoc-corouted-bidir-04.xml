    <abstract>
      <t>Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) association signaling can be used to bind two unidirectional LSPs into an associated bidirectional LSP. When an associated bidirectional LSP is co-routed, the reverse LSP follows the same path as its forward LSP. This document describes Fast Reroute (FRR) procedures for both single-sided and double-sided provisioned associated bidirectional LSPs. The FRR procedures are applicable to co-routed and non co-routed LSPs. For co-routed LSPs, the FRR procedures can ensure that traffic flows on co-routed paths in the forward and reverse directions after a failure event.</t>
