      <t>This Internet-draft presents a protocol developed at Adaptec, Inc. as part of a proof-of-concept demonstration that Gigabit Ethernet can serve as a direct replacement for traditional storage interconnects. The draft discusses the scope of problems that the protocol addresses, the key design decisions that were made, and then documents the protocol details.</t>
