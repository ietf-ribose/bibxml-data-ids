      <t>A key problem in the design of RSVP version 1 is, as noted inits applicability statement, that it lacks facilities foraggregation of individual reserved sessions into a commonclass. The use of such aggregation is recommended in the paperby Clark, Shenker, and Zhang in SIGCOMM '92, and required forscalability.This document describes the use of a single RSVP reservationto aggregate other RSVP reservations across a transit routingregion, in a manner conceptually similar to the use of VirtualPaths in an ATM network. It proposes a way to dynamicallycreate the aggregate reservation, classify the traffic forwhich the aggregate reservation applies, determine how muchbandwidth is needed to achieve the requirement, and recoverthe bandwidth when the sub-reservations are no longerrequired. It also contains recommendations concerningalgorithms and policies for predictive reservations.</t>
