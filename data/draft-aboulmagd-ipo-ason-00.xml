      <t>This draft describes an architecture for intelligent optical networks. This architecture is called the automatic switched optical networks (ASON). ASON is a client-server architecture with well- defined interfaces that allows clients to request services from the optical network (server). ASON architecture and its generic automatic switched transport networks (ASTN) has been an active study area both at T1X1 and ITU [2].</t>
