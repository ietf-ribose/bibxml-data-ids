    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP) and proposes a CPP Template to capture IP connectivity requirements to be met in the context of delivery of services (e.g. Voice over IP or IP TV) which are to be plugged upon an IP/MPLS infrastructure. The CPP defines the set of IP transfer parameters to be supported by the underlying IP/MPLS transport network together with a reachability scope and bandwidth/capacity needs. Appropriate performance metrics such as one-way delay, one-way delay variation are used to characterize an IP transfer service. Both global and restricted reachability scopes can be captured in the CPP. Having the generic CPP template allows for (1) automating the process of service negotiation and activation, thus accelerating service provisioning, (2) setting the (traffic) objectives of Traffic Engineering functions and service management functions and (3) enriching service and network management systems with 'decision- making' capabilities based on negotiated/offered CPPs.</t>
