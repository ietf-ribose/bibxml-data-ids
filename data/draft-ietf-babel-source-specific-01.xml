      <t>Source-specific routing is an extension to traditional next-hop routing where packets are forwarded according to both their destination and their source address. This document describes the source-specific routing extension to the Standard Track's Babel routing protocol defined in [BABEL]. It is incompatible with the Experimental Track's Babel [RFC6126]. Source-specific routing is also known as Source Address Dependent Routing, SAD Routing, SADR, Destination/Source Routing or Source/ Destination Routing.</t>
