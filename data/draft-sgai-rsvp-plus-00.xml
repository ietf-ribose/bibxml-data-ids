      <t>RSVP has been extended in several direction [DiffEdge], [Policy], [Identity], [DCLASS], [AggrRSVP], [COPS-RSVP], [COPS-RSVP+], one of the more relevant being the addition of the support for qualitative QoS [QualSvc]. This document refers to these extensions as RSVP+ and describes variations on standard RSVP router message processing. Specific variations are driven under policy control. Variations include admission control to diffserv aggregate classes, receiver proxying, support for aggregated and tunneled RSVP and others.</t>
