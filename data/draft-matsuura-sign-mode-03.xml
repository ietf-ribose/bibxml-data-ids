      <t>Phase 1 of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) [HC98] has several modeswith different number of message passes. For those who want to savetheir bandwidth, three-pass Aggressive Mode is a good choice sinceit has minimal number of message passes in Phase 1.The public-key primitive method in Aggressive Mode providessignificant security advantages over the other alternatives andshould be the method of choice in many implementations. In thismethod, however, the responder must pay computational cost asexpensive as modular exponentiation BEFORE identifying theinitiator. This feature can be abused by malicious initiators for aDenial-of-Service (DoS) attack. The purpose of this document is tosolve this problem in digital-signature method by using falling-together (FT) mechanism [MI98], [MI99] in conjunction withstateless-connection technique [AN97] and an appropriate use ofCookies [KS99].</t>
