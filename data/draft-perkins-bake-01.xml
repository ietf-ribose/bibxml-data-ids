      <t>A method is proposed for providing key information for use between a mobile node and correspondent node, to be used for the purpose of authenticating Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates. The key distribution is secure except against man-in-the-middle attacks, when the attacker resides along the routing path between the correspondent node and the mobile node's home agent. The key can be used for authenticating subsequent Binding Updates from the same mobile node, substantially reducing the number of key establishment cycles needed for maintaining efficient communication paths between the mobile node and correspondent node.</t>
