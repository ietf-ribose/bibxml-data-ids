    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a protocol, BMP, that can be used to monitor BGP sessions. BMP is intended to provide a convenient interface for obtaining route views. Prior to introduction of BMP, screen-scraping was the most commonly-used approach to obtaining such views. The design goals are to keep BMP simple, useful, easily implemented, and minimally service-affecting. BMP is not suitable for use as a routing protocol.</t>
