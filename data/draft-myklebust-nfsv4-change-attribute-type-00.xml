    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an extension to the NFSv4 protocol that allows the server to share information about the implementation of its change attribute with the client. The aim is to improve the client's ability to determine the order in which parallel updates to the same file were processed.Keywords The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</t>
