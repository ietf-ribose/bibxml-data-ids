      <t>This document specifies methodology for benchmarking convergence of routers without making assumptions about relation and dependencies between data- and control-planes. Provided methodology is primary intended for testing routers running BGP and some form of link-state IGP with or without MPLS. It may also be applicable for environments using MPLS-TE or GRE, however they're beyond scope of this document and such application is left for further study.</t>
