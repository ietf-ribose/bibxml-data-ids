      <t>Hosts in an IP network are identified by IP addresses, and the IP address prefixes of subnets are advertised by routing protocols. A change in such IP addressing information associated with a host or subnet is known as "renumbering". This memo provides information for the Internet community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind.</t>
