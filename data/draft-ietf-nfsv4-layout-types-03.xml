      <t>This document provides help in distinguishing between the requirements for Network File System (NFS) version 4.1's Parallel NFS (pNFS) and those those specifically directed to the pNFS File Layout. The lack of a clear separation between the two set of requirements has been troublesome for those specifying and evaluating new Layout Types. As this document clarifies RFC5661, it effectively updates RFC5661.</t>
