      <t>Most of the initial efforts on Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) have beenrelated to environments of single switching capability devices e.g.one data plane layer, as such, the complexity raised by such controlplanes is similar to the one expected in classical IP/MPLS networks.The fundamental reason being that an IP-based control plane protocolsuite for Label Switch Routers (LSR) or Optical Cross-Connects (OXC)has exactly the same Level (i.e. single data plane layer)complexity.The present document analyses the various GMPLS signaling androuting aspects when considering network environments consisting ofmultiple switching data layers e.g. supporting combinedPacket/Layer-2 Switching - OXC devices. The examples provide anoverview of the tradeoffs in using a GMPLS control plane forcombined Ethernet MAC - opaque, service transparent, and/or fullytransparent data planes. The intent of this memo is also todemonstrate that these aspects may not be as straightforward as theymay first appear.</t>
