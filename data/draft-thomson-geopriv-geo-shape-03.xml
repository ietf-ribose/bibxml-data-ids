      <t>This document defines a set of shapes for the representation of uncertainty for PIDF-LO geodetic location information. This includes a GML profile and a schema that defines additional geometries. Further recommendations are made to restrict the use of geographic Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) and units of measure restrictions that improve interoperability.</t>
