      <t>This document describes the need for a WHois email address service similar to the internet domainname WHois service. Theres a need for a registered email address as opposed to non-registered email address to fight internet SPAM, as well as encouraging email use for personal, commercial and all kinds of purposes.An internet user can have multiple email identities. This service implementation would also help deliver a Single SignON solution for WWW services.</t>
