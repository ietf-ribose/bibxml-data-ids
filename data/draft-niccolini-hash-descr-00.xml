      <t>This document is concerned with the specification and properties of Hash Functions for packet selection in PSAMP. Having a detailed and exhaustive description of the Hash Function, in terms of input parameters, output value, selection range and internal operations is fundamental for coherent configuration of the same hash based selection at different points in the network. This coherency is fundamental for all network measurement applications needing consistent packet selection.</t>
