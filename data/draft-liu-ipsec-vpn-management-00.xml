      <t>This document defines a common interface format for describing the configuration of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) in the context of IPSec and equipment from different vendors. The configuration format would be both importable and exportable by various vendors of VPN equipment and software that is IPSec compliant, facilitating an uniform and perhaps automated method of interoperability (creating a VPN) between VPN products from different vendors. This document will only discuss the proposed configuration format. The mechanism by which the file is propagated is beyond the scope of this document and will not be discussed. A security association is not mandatory between two management stations from different vendors wishing to employ this method of VPN configuration, as this configuration format can easily be packaged in a file and propagated out of band.</t>
