    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a mechanism for hosts with any network connectivity (IPv4 only, IPv6 only, or dual IPv4/IPv6 connectivity) to run applications of any capability (IPv4 only, IPv6 only, or dual IPv4/IPv6) without any modification to those applications. It is a generalisation of a previous experimental protocol called "Bump-in-the-API" (BIA) [RFC3338]. New mechanism of BIA allows a changeover between the application layer and the IP communication layers from IPv4 to IPv6 and vice versa or IPv6 to IPv4 and vice versa, without requiring those applications to be converted in addressing capabilities, effectively shielding the application layer from IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity. This is considered by the authors to be one of the essential conditions for the transition to IPv6 in the Internet to be successful.</t>
