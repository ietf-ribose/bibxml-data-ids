      <t>This document describes several issues relevant to the design of a network mobility support solution that relies on the bi-directional tunnel between Mobile Router and Home Agent, with Mobile IP. Examples of issues are: conflicting Mobile IP and RIPng/OSPF requirements on link-local addresses, HA/BR co-location, and 'cross-over' tunnels.</t>
