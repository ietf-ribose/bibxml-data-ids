    <abstract>
      <t>This memo specifies a forwarding method for bounded latency for Deterministic Networks. It uses cycle tagging of packets for cyclic queuing and forwarding with multiple buffers (TCQF). This memo standardizes tagging via the MPLS packet Traffic Class (TC) field for MPLS links and the IP/IPv6 DSCPfield for IP/IPv6 links. The short- hand for this mechanism is Tagged Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (TCQF). Target benefits of TCQF include low end-to-end jitter, ease of high- speed hardware implementation, optional ability to support large number of flow in large networks via DiffServ style aggregation by applying TCQF to the DetNet aggregate instead of each DetNet flow individually, and support of wide-area DetNet networks with arbitrary link latencies and latency variations.</t>
