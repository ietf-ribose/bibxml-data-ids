    <abstract>
      <t>The TCP protocol relies on receivers sending accurate and timelyfeedback to the sender. Currently the sender has no means to verifythat a receiver is correctly sending this feedback according to theprotocol. A receiver that is non-compliant has the potential todisrupt a sender's resource allocation, increasing its transmissionrate on that connection which in turn could adversely affect thenetwork itself. This document presents a two stage test process thatcan be used to identify whether a receiver is non-compliant. Thetests enshrine the principle that one shouldn't attribute to malicethat which may be accidental. The first stage test causes minimumimpact to the receiver but raises a suspicion of non-compliance. Thesecond stage test can then be used to verify that the receiver isnon-compliant. This specification does not modify the core TCPprotocol - the tests can either be implemented as a test suite or asa stand-alone test through a simple modification to the senderimplementation.StatusBy submitting this Internet-Draft, each author represents that anyapplicable patent or other IPR claims of which he or she is awarehave been or will be disclosed, and any of which he or she becomesaware will be disclosed, in accordance with Section 6 of BCP 79.Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet EngineeringTask Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.

These were largely to better comply with the stated aimsof the previous version but also included some tidying up of theprotocol details and a new section on a possible unwantedinteraction.From -00 to -01:Draft rewritten to emphasise testing for non-compliance. Somechanges to protocol to remove possible unwanted interactions withother TCP variants. Sections added on comparison of solutions andalternative uses of test.</t>
