      <t>This document formalizes and consolidates the definition of the Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN) of the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), addressing implementer experience. Replacing EDN's previous informal descriptions, it updates RFC 8949, obsoleting its Section 8, and RFC 8610, obsoleting its Appendix G. It also specifies and uses registry-based extension points, using one to support text representations of epoch-based dates/times and of IP addresses and prefixes. // (This cref will be removed by the RFC editor:) The present -19 // includes the definition of the cri'' application- extension. cri'' // was previously defined in draft-ietf-core-href; however the latter // document overtook the present document in the approval process. // As the definition of cri'' is dependent on the present document // (and conversely has essentially no dependency on the technical // content of draft-ietf-core-href beyond its mere existence), the // text (including IANA considerations) has been moved here. -19 is // intended for use at the CBOR WG meeting at IETF 124.</t>
