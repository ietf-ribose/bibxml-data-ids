      <t>This document provides an information model for the optical impairment characteristics of optical network elements for use in GMPLS/PCE control plane protocols and mechanisms. This information model supports Impairment Aware Routing and Wavelength Assignment (IA-RWA) in optical networks in which path computation and optical path validation are essential components. This is not a general network management information model. This model is based on ITU-T defined optical network element characteristics as given in ITU-T recommendation G.680 and related specifications. This model is intentionally compatible with a previous impairment free optical information model used in optical path computations and wavelength assignment.</t>
