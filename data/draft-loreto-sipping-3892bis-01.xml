      <t>SIP has a mechanism for conveying the identity of the referrer of arequest by means of the Referred-By header field. This header fieldmay be used when exploding a SIP MESSAGE request to a pre-definedgroup URI and when exploding a SIP INVITE request to an ad-hoc groupor to a pre-defined group URI. The Referred-By header is onlyincluded if the P-Asserted-Identity header field or From header fieldin the exploded SIP requests needs to carry another value, e.g. theURI of a pre-defined group, or a conference focus URI. In thosecases, the Referred-By header field in the resulting explodedrequests is set to the P-Asserted-Identity header field or to theFrom header field of the original SIP request received beforeexploding to convey to the receiver the identity of the originalinviting sender.RFC 3892 restricts the value of the header to only one SIP URI.However the P-Asserted-Identity header field currently allows two URIvalues and may be expanded in the future to carry more than twovalues as described in draft-ietf-sipping-update-pai-09. Thisdocument extends the Referred-By definition to support more than onevalue as well.</t>
