      <t>The logs in Certificate Transparency are untrusted in the sense that the users of the system don't have to trust that they behave correctly since the behaviour of a log can be verified to be correct. This document tries to solve the problem with logs presenting a "split view" of their operations. It describes three gossiping mechanisms for Certificate Transparency: SCT Feedback, STH Pollination and Trusted Auditor Relationship.</t>
