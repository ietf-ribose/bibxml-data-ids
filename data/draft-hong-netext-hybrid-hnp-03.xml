      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) supports multihoming where a mobile nodecan connect to a PMIPv6 domain through multiple interfaces forsimultaneous access or inter-technology handoff. However, for aninter-technology handoff, PMIPv6 does not allow simultaneous accesssince all the home network prefixes associated with one interface aredelivered to another interface of a mobile node. In addition, if weassume that the flow is classified by home network prefix, then thePMIPv6 cannot support flow mobility since it requires moving justsome home network prefixes between interfaces. In this document, wepropose a hybrid home network prefix assignment (HHNPA) scheme whereboth the static prefix model and the dynamic prefix model are used.By using these two different home network prefix models, it cansupport flow mobility that some home network prefixes are moved toanother interface and some home network prefixes are remained atexisting interface.</t>
