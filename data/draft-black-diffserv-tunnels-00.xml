      <t>This draft discusses the interaction of Differentiated Services (diffserv) [RFC-2474, RFC-2475] with IP tunnels of various forms. The discussion of tunnels in the diffserv architecture [RFC-2475] has been found to provide insufficient guidance to tunnel designers and implementers. With the aim of providing such guidance, this document describes two conceptual models for the interaction of diffserv with IP tunnels and employs them to explore the resulting configurations and combinations of functionality. An important consideration is how and where diffserv traffic conditioning should be performed in the presence of tunnel encapsulation/decapsulation. A few simple mechanisms are also proposed that limit the complexity that tunnels would otherwise add to the diffserv traffic conditioning model; these mechanisms are also generally useful in situations where more general traffic conditioning is inappropriate or unavailable. Security considerations for IPsec tunnels place some limits on possible functionality in some circumstances. WARNING: The current status of this draft is highly preliminary; its major purpose is to foster discussion within the working group. Above and beyond the usual cautionary notice about not relying on Internet-Drafts, implementers are specifically warned that significant changes are expected to the contents of this draft.</t>
