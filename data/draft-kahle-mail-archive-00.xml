      <t>This draft proposes a mail header field 'Restrict:' with a defined value of 'no-external-archive' that gives information to a receiving mail transport agent or mail user agent that this message should not be archived by individuals or organizations not associated with the list owner. With the increasing number of search engines that gather information and offer wide access, some writers and would like to restrict how their words are distributed. Mailing lists may begin (or have already begun) to be systematically archived for searching and historical reference. This draft is designed for mailing lists, but it can also be applied to messages in Usenet newsgroups as well. The legal issues around this are deep and difficult, and this draft does not address these legal issues. However, it would be useful to respectful mail receivers if there was a standard method for mail creators (authors or list owners) to express their desires about whether or not their mail can be archived.</t>
