      <t>Several approaches to transporting the ITU-T Q.931 User to User Information Element (UU IE) data in SIP have been proposed. As networks move to SIP it is important that applications requiring this data can continue to function in SIP networks as well as the ability to interwork with this ISDN service for end-to-end transparency. This document discusses requirements and approaches. This extension will also be used for native SIP endpoints implementing similar services and interworking with ISDN services. Example use cases include an exchange between two user agents, retargeting by a proxy, and redirection. An example application is an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) in a contact center.</t>
