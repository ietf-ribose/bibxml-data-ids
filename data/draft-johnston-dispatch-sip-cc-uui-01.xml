      <t>Several approaches to transporting the ITU-T Q.931 User to UserInformation Element (UU IE) data in SIP have been proposed. Asnetworks move to SIP it is important that applications requiring thisdata can continue to function in SIP networks as well as the abilityto interwork with this ISDN service for end-to-end transparency.This document discusses requirements and approaches. This extensionwill also be used for native SIP endpoints implementing similarservices and interworking with ISDN services. Example use casesinclude an exchange between two user agents, retargeting by a proxy,and redirection. An example application is an Automatic CallDistributor (ACD) in a contact center.</t>
