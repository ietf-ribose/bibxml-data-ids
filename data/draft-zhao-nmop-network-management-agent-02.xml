    <abstract>
      <t>With the development of AI(Artificial Intelligence) technology, large model have shown significant advantages and great potential in recognition, understanding, decision-making, and generation, and can well match the self-intelligent network management requirements for the goal of autonomous network or Intent-based Networking, and can be used as one of the potential driving technologies to drive high-level autonomous networks. When introducing AI for network management, how to integrate AI technology and deal with the relationship with the existing network management entity (such as network controller) is the focus of research and standardization. This document presents the concept of AI based network management agent(NMA), provides the basic definition and reference architecture of NMA, discusses the relationship of NMA with traditional network controller or other network management entity by exploring the delpoyment mode of NMA, and proposes the comman processing flow and typical application scenarios of NMA.</t>
