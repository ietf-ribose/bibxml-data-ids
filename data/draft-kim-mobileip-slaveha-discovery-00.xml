      <t>This document proposes a new mechanism in Mobile IPv6, which allows a mobile node to discover promptly a suitable slave home agent's address on its home link when the mobile node may not know a master home agent's address due to some reasons. To implement the proposed mechanism, new Binding Update/Acknowledgement messages are defined. The proposed mechanism might be more efficient and general, and faster than the existing Home Agent Address Discovery in [1].</t>
