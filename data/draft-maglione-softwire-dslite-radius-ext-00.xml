      <t>Dual-Stack Lite is a solution to offer both IPv4 and IPv6connectivity to customers which are addressed only with an IPv6prefix. DS-Lite requires to pre-configure the AFTR tunnelinformation on the B4 element. In many networks, the customerprofile information may be stored in AAA servers while clientconfigurations are mainly provided through DHC protocol. Thisdocument specifies two new RADIUS attributes to carry Dual-Stack LiteAddress Family Transition Router (AFTR) IPv6 address and name; theRADIUS attributes are defined based on the equivalent DHCPv6 optionsalready specified in draft-ietf-softwire-ds-lite-tunnel-option.These RADIUS attributes are meant to be used between the RADIUSServer and the NAS, they are not intended to be used directly betweenthe B4 element and the RADIUS Server.</t>
