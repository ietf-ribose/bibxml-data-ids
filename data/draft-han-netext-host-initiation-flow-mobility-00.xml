      <t>Multihomed mobile nodes are capable of simultaneous attachment to multiple access networks. In this case, a PMIPv6-enabled local mobility anchor should distribute the application traffic to a proper access network which the mobile nodes wish to receive from. This document specifies how mobile nodes send their desire of flow movement to an attached mobile access gateway, which then relays it to a local mobility anchor.</t>
