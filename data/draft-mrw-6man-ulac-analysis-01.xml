      <t>There has been discussion within the IETF IPv6 community for sometime regarding whether or not to define Centrally Assigned UniqueLocal Addresses (ULA-Cs). Although many arguments both for andagainst the definition of ULA-Cs have been raised and repeated, ourdiscussions have not resulted in consensus about whether or not todefine this new address type. This document will summarize thearguments for and against the allocation of ULA-Cs, in an attempt tohelp the IETF IPv6 community reach a decision on this issue.</t>
