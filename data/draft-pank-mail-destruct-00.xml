      <t>As e-mail use is becoming more prevalent and the applications of its use more diverse it is increasingly becoming a burden to users and system administration staff to maintain message stores and 'weed-out' obsolete messages. The problem also manifests itself as a direct cost to organisations trying to maintain storage space for user e- mail messages where a considerable proportion of messages are simply forgotten and lay dormant. RFC 822 defines a message representation protocol specifying details about US-ASCII message headers. As an extension to this protocol this memo proposes the introduction of an additional header to enable e-mail messages to 'self-destruct' after a specified period depending on a number of conditions that may have been specified by the originator or can subsequently be (re-)specified by the recipient. This memo also proposes possible client and server implementations with a view of soliciting feedback and further refining of the extensions.</t>
