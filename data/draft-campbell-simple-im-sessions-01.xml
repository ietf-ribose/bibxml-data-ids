      <t>The SIP MESSAGE method is used to send instant messages, where eachmessage is independent of any other message. This is often calledpager-mode messaging, due to the fact that this model is similar tothat of most two-way pager devices. Another model is calledsession-mode. In session-mode, the instant messages are part of amedia session that provides ordering, a security context, and otherfunctions. This media session is established using a SIP INVITE, justas an audio or video session would be established.This document describes a The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP),a mechanism for transmitting session-mode messages with minimal relaysupport. Additionally, this document describes using the SDP offer/answer model to initiate such sessions.</t>
