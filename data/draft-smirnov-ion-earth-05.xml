      <t>The EARTH could be positioned between MARS [1] and VENUS [2], however EARTH deals not only with address resolution but with routing issues as well. This document describes a solution simplifying distribution of IP multicast flows over ATM clouds with the use of point-to-multipoint connections. The EARTH solution includes: - the notion of multicast IP subnet over ATM; - IP multicast addresses (Class D) resolution to ATM addresses; - support for IP multicast shortcuts over multiple LISs and for the DVMRP capable egress routers; - support for a multicast group management and receiver-initiated quality of service (QoS) specification; - optional replication of EARTH servers with server synchronisation based on SCSP [3]. The current version of EARTH proposal has an extension to solve problems of ATM backbone for the Internet with DVMRP support over MLIS; while retaining support for ATM subnets (LANs). Another extension addresses redundant EARTH servers specifying, how SCSP protocol could be re-designed to run over MLIS.</t>
