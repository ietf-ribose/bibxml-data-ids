      <t>This document discusses the requirements and procedures to achieve themultihoming of media for voice over IP sessions using the transport layerprotocol as signaling Control Transmission Protocol.Media is an essential part of any voice over IP session. SIP (RFC 3261)is a text based signaling protocol and Multihoming using SIP can beachieved by using the SCTP as a transport protocol (RFC 4168),therefore the application level resiliency can be guaranteed even incase of any middle node or terminal failures. But any voice over IP ormultimedia session is nearly insignificant, if the media path is brokenduring a call and is waiting for a timeout which further shall lead to acall drop.A complete solution to Multihoming can be achieved if a systemis capable of a performing the failovers at both application and mediaplane and still maintaining the session irrespective of the applicationor media path failures or at least to detect a signaling or media pathfailure and terminate the session rather than waiting for timeouts. Therequirement of Multihoming in media can also be derived from the factthat in any voice, video or data session, the signaling and call setuptime use to be incomparably short than that of real media session atmedia plane. Therefore providing the resiliency at the signaling leveldoes not provide the guaranteed and best effort service from a mediasession point of view as not only signaling but media is an integralpart of it.</t>
