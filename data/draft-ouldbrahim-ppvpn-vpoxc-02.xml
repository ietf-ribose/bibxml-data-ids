      <t>This document describes an Optical Virtual Private Network service (OVPN) called Virtual Private Optical Cross-Connect (VPOXC). A VPOXC is a provider provisioned VPN service part of the customer private network but administered and under the control of the service provider. A VPOXC operates similarly to a physical optical cross-connect except that it allows a wide spectrum of port topology such as hub and spoke, full mesh, and arbitrary topologies. To the VPOXC customer, the service provider network appears as a virtual private optical cross- connect where customer sites are attached to. The VPOXC port topology is defined by the customer, and enforced by the service provider. Customers can signal any optical connectivity according to the port topology implemented by the VPOXC. Client devices operate within the VPOXC space independently from the service provider network operations.</t>
