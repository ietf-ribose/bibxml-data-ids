    <abstract>
      <t>The following document includes observations regarding a variety of implementations of recursive DNS capabilities that are important to network operators in terms of delivering DNS services to their (several tens of millions of) customers. It highlights some of the challenges that need to be addressed to allow the widespread adoption of encrypted DNS by the end-users of network operators. The information is intended to aid the development of discovery mechanisms for protocols such as DNS-over-HTTPS. It clearly defines problems that need technical solutions to allow the deployment of encrypted DNS by the largest number of operators to the largest number of users in the shortest possible timeframe with little or no disruption to the user experience.</t>
