      <t>This is a list of things that often delay processing of RFCs byIESG and/or the RFC Editor, and which are often preventable by RFCauthors. The purpose of this document is to list in one place the mostfrequent causes of unnecessary delay, and thereby help RFC authors mini-mize such delays when possible. This document is emphatically NOT an expression of IESG policy, northat of the RFC Editor, and is provided merely for informational pur-poses. When appropriate, this document attempts to provide referencesto other documents, some of which are expressions of IESG, IETF, and/orRFC Editor policy and others which are merely informational. Readersare advised to check the official status of each reference. The RFC Editor's instructions to RFC Authors are in [rfc-instruc-tions].</t>
