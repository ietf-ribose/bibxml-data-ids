      <t>The IETF has established a Working Group on OSI Directory Services. A major component of the initial work of this group is to establish a technical framework for establishing a Directory Service on the Internet, making use of the X.500 protocols and services. This document summarises the strategy established by the Working Group, and describes a number of RFCs which will be written in order to establish the technical framework.</t>
