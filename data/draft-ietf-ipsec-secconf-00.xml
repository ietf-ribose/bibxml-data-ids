      <t>Remote configuration of network devices which implement IPsec- related services is desirable as a matter of convenience and of scale. In some cases, these devices are installed on a network with no prior configuration. In such cases, secure mechanisms for bootstrap configuration are required. In this document the associated issues are examined, and a multi-tiered approach is proposed from which a specific method may be selected based upon the security requirements of the environment in which the security device exists. While the primary devices considered here are security gateways and bump-in-the-wire encryptors, many of the resulting conclusions may extend to other devices, including host IPsec implementations.</t>
