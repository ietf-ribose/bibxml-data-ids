      <t>AFS-3 is a distributed file system based upon prototypes developed at Carnegie Mellon University during the 1980s. AFS-3 heavily leverages Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) as the foundation for its distributed architecture. In 2003, new RPCs were introduced into AFS-3 that provide for capability querying between file servers and cache managers. This memo provides a formal specification for that functionality, and provides analogous extensions to the volume server RPC interface. Internet Draft Comments Comments regarding this draft are solicited. Please include the AFS-3 protocol standardization mailing list (afs3-standardization@openafs.org) as a recipient of any comments. AFS-3 Document State This document is in state "draft", as per the document state definitions set forth in [I-D.wilkinson-afs3-standardisation].</t>
