      <t>This document shows an application to obtain a permit to operate a telephone company. This was included as an internet-draft because of the common use of telephone connections for dial-up internet service and thus may be of interest to the Internet community. The actual tariff schedules as filed as part of this application will be included as a later internet-draft.</t>
