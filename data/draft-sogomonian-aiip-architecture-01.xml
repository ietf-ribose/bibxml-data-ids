      <t>This document specifies the architectural model and core protocol behaviors for the Artificial Intelligence Internet Protocol (AIIP). AIIP provides a uniform way for agents, robots, tools, models, and services to be addressed and invoked either natively or through an HTTPS gateway. Beyond addressing, AIIP defines a _stateless compute_ profile in which endpoints do not retain caller data and each invocation returns a signed _execution receipt_. Receipts are REQUIRED to be attested with Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) evidence and MAY additionally include zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Receipts MAY also be anchored to external settlement systems without exposing user data.</t>
