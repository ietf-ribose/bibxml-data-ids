      <t>This note describes an optional modification for TCP's slow-start foruse with TCP connections with large congestion windows. For TCPconnections that are able to use congestion windows of thousands (ortens of thousands) of MSS-sized segments (for MSS the sender'sMAXIMUM SEGMENT SIZE), the current slow-start procedure can result inincreasing the congestion window by thousands of segments in a singleround-trip time. Such an increase can easily result in thousands ofpackets being dropped in one round-trip time. This is often counter-productive for the TCP flow itself, and is also hard on the rest ofthe traffic sharing the congested link. This note describes LimitedSlow-Start as an optional mechanism for limiting the number ofsegments by which the congestion window is increased for one windowof data during slow-start, in order to improve performance for TCPconnections with large congestion windows.</t>
