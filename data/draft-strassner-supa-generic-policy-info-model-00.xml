      <t>The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) addresses the needs of operators and application developers to represent multiple types of policy rules. This document defines a common structure for policy rules that is independent of language, protocol, and the level of abstraction of the content of the policy rule. This enables multiple policy rule data models to be constructed from it.</t>
