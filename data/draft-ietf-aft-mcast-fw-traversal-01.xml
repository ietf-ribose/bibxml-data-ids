      <t>This proposal creates a mechanism for managing the ingress or egress of IP multicast through a firewall. It does this by defining extensions to the existing SOCKS V5 protocol [RFC-1928], which provides a framework for doing user-level, authenticated firewall traversal of unicast TCP and UDP traffic. However, because the current UDP support in SOCKS V5 has scalability problems as well as other deficiencies -- and these need to be addressed before multicast support can be achieved -- the extensions are defined in two parts: Base-level UDP extensions, and Multicast UDP extensions. Using the SOCKS framework for managing multicast flows in/out of an organization, offers numerous security advantages over what is possible with a conventional firewall approach. These are spelled out in the draft.</t>
