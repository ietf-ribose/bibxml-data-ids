      <t>This document provides heuristic procedures that translate managed object specifications from ISO/CCITT Guidelines for Definition of Managed Object (GDMO) templates to Internet MIB macros. Currently, some market segments demand SNMP for customer network management, while others require the ISO/CCITT Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP). The approach defined in this document accommodates both, protecting investment already made in management information specifications and minimizing cost to implement a second protocol where the market requires. This translation is designed to: lose as little functionality as possible in translation; minimize need for human involvement during translation; minimize the cost of dual protocol and proxy-based implementations; and support generic network models which span many computer platforms and network elements. This document is intended to encourage standardization of such an approach and promote consistent usage of MIB definitions, independent of protocol.</t>
