      <t>This document describes the use of references in RFCs and IANA registries. It also discusses situations where RFCs are currently required as references in IANA registries. This document does not define any new policies, but instead describes the many practices that have been used, particularly the practices that are considered best current practices today. This document is informative, and thus does not require changes to, or prohibit exceptions from, the current practices.</t>
