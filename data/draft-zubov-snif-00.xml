      <t>This document proposes a solution, referred as SNIF, that provides the means for any Internet connected device to: * allocate a globally unique anonymous hostname * obtain and maintain a publicly trusted X.509 certificate [RFC5280] issued for the allocated hostname * accept incoming TLS connections on specific TCP ports of the allocated hostname from any TLS clients that are capable of sending Server Name Indication [RFC6066] The private key associated with the X.509 certificate is securely stored on the TLS terminating device, and is never exposed to any other party at any step of the process.
