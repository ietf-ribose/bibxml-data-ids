    <abstract>
      <t>The term 'service-based routing' (SBR) captures the set of mechanisms for the steering of traffic in an application-level service scenario. We position this steering as an anycast problem, requiring the selection of one of the possibly many choices for service execution at the very start of a service transaction. This document builds on the issues and pain points identified across a range of use cases, reported in [I-D.mendes-rtgwg-rosa-use-cases]. We summarize the key insights and provide a gap analysis with key technologies related to the problem of SBR, developed by the IETF over many years. We further outline the requirements to a system that would adequately close those gaps and thus address the pain points of our use cases. Those requirements will be used for outlining a suitable architecture framework in a separate document.</t>
