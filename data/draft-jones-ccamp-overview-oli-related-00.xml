      <t>This document presents an overview of contributions made in IETF, ITU-T and T1X1.5 pertaining to the Optical Link Interface (OLI) and related interfaces. The intent is to summarize for the IETF community the different approaches and corresponding interface and protocol specification under-construction in these different standardization bodies; this in order to provide the material during CCAMP WG meetings. Since the scope of this memo is not to replace in any case these contributions, we also strongly encourage the reader to refer to these contributions for more details. Notice since OIF contributions are regulated by privacy copyright related documents arenâ€™t referenced in this memo.</t>
