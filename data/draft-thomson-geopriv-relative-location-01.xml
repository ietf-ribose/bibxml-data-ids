      <t>This document defines an extension to PIDF-LO (RFC4119) for theexpression of location information that is defined relative to areference point. The reference point may be expressed as a geodeticor civic location, and the relative offset may be one of severalshapes. Optionally, a reference to a secondary document (such as amap image) can be included, along with the relationship of the mapcoordinate system to the reference/offset coordinate system to allowdisplay of the map with the reference point and the relative offset.Also included in this document is a Type/Length/Value (TLV)representation of the relative location for use in other protocolsthat use TLVs.</t>
