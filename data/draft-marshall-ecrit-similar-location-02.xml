      <t>This document introduces a new way to provide returned location information in LoST responses that is either of a completed or similar form to the original input civic location, based on whether a valid or invalid location is returned within the findServiceResponse message. This document defines a new extension to the findServiceResponse message within the LoST protocol [RFC5222] that enables the LoST protocol to return a completed civic location element set for a valid response, and one or more suggested sets of civic location information for invalid LoST responses. These two types of civic addresses are referred to as either "complete" or "similar" locations, and are included as compilation of ca type xml elements within the existing response message structure.</t>
