    <abstract>
      <t>Optical in-band crosstalk between interfering optical channels has been identified (see [ITC-DIL]) as one of the major limitations to the diameter and the performance of photonic (or all-optical) networks. In this context in-band crosstalk remains a cause of optical signal degradation in switching elements included in a Photonic Cross-Connect (PXC).</t>
