      <t>Optical in-band crosstalk between interfering optical channels hasbeen identified (see [ITC-DIL]) as one of the major limitations tothe diameter and the performance of photonic (or all-optical)networks. In this context in-band crosstalk remains a cause ofoptical signal degradation in switching elements included in aPhotonic Cross-Connect (PXC).</t>
