      <t>The Mobile IP working group has been considering enhancements that significantly reduce the amount of service disruption involved in Mobile IP handover. The proposals considered by the working group so far are based on having Layer 2 information available prior to the handover that allows the Mobile Node and/or the old Foreign Agent to prepare for handover in some fashion.</t>
