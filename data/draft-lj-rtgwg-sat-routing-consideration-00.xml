    <abstract>
      <t>The SDO 3GPP has done tremendous work to either standardize or study various types of wireless services that would depend on the satellite constellation network. While the ISLs, or Inter-Satellite Links, along with the routing scheme(s) over them are critical to help fullfil the satellite services, the 3GPP considers them out-of-scope. This leaves the significant work to be explored in the IETF domain. This draft stems from the 3GPP satellite use cases that have been studied for many years up to now, across a couple of releases, and lands on summarizing the challenges &amp; considerations of the satellite-based routing. Based on some unique &amp; advantageous characteristics associated with satellite networks, the draft raises briefly the general routing considerations for the integrated Non- Terrestrial &amp; Terrestial Networks.</t>
