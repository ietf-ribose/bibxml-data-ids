      <t>Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a technique for inter-domain SIP federation.

The ViPR architecture uses a server, the ViPR server, which performs P2P and validation services on behalf of call agents, which acts as clients to the server. Such an architecture requires a client/server protocol between call agents and the ViPR server. That protocol, defined here, is called the ViPR Access Protocol (VAP).</t>
