      <t>In wide-area IP networks, more requirements need to be taken into considerations such as differentiated DetNet QoS of multiple services, high-efficiency of resources utilization and routes steering, integration of large-scale heterogeneous network and guarantees of multiple dynamic deterministic flows. This document describes the requirements in wide-area applications and proposes the solution with deterministic resources, routes and QoS.</t>
