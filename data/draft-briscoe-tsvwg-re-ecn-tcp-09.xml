      <t>This document introduces a new protocol for explicit congestionnotification (ECN), termed re-ECN, which can be deployedincrementally around unmodified routers. The protocol works byarranging an extended ECN field in each packet so that, as it crossesany interface in an internetwork, it will carry a truthful predictionof congestion on the remainder of its path. The purpose of thisdocument is to specify the re-ECN protocol at the IP layer and togive guidelines on any consequent changes required to transportprotocols. It includes the changes required to TCP both as anexample and as a specification. It briefly gives examples ofmechanisms that can use the protocol to ensure data sources respondcorrectly to congestion, but these are described more fully in acompanion document.</t>
