    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the technical requirements and the related reference model for the intercommunication and coordination among devices in Autonomic Slicing Networking. The goal is to define how the various elements in a network slicing context work and orchestrate together, to describe their interfaces and relations. While the document is written as generally as possible, the initial solutions are limited to the chartered scope of the WG.</t>
