      <t>Secure Frames (SFrame) defines a compact scheme for encrypting real- time media. In order for SFrame to address cases where media are exchanged among many participants (e.g., real-time conferencing), it needs to be augmented with a group key management protocol. The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol provides continuous group authenticated key exchange, allowing a group of participants in a media session to authenticate each other and agree on a group key. This document defines how the group keys produced by MLS can be used with SFrame to secure real-time sessions for groups.</t>
