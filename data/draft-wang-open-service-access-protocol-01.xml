      <t>With the development of IoT(Internet of Things) technology, everything is interconnected. Mass IoT data, devices, businesses, and services adopt different data descriptions and service access methods, resulting in fragmentation issues, such as data heterogeneous, device heterogeneous, and application heterogeneous, which hinders the development of the industry. In order to solve the problem, this draft proposes the requirements for IoT smart devices to transmit and control, as well as transmission and protocol interfaces. It is for the program design, system testing and acceptance, and related research. Structured, unified, and standardized open service interconnection model reduces business replication cost and removes service barriers to push industrial development.</t>
