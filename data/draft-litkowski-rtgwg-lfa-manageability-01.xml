    <abstract>
      <t>Loop Free Alternates (LFA), as defined in RFC 5286 is an IP Fast ReRoute (IP FRR) mechanism enabling traffic protection for IP traffic (and MPLS LDP traffic by extension). Following first deployment experiences, this document provides operational feedback on LFA, highlights some limitations, and proposes a set of refinements to address those limitations. It also proposes required management specifications. This proposal is also applicable to remote LFA solution.</t>
