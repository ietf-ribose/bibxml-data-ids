    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an authenticated in-band method for automatic signaling of a Child DNS zone's delegation signer information from the zone's DNS operator(s). The zone's registrar or registry may subsequently use this signal for automatic DS record provisioning in the parent zone. The protocol is particularly useful in case of managed DNS providers hosting registrant's domains, where DS provisioning has so far been cumbersome. The signaling channel is not specific to the DS bootstrapping use case, but equally suitable for announcing other zone-specific information from the DNS Operator in an authenticated fashion. Further potential applications thus include, for example, key exchange between parties in an [RFC8901] multisigner setup.
