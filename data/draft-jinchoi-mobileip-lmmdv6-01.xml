      <t>This document presents Localized Mobility Management for MobileIPv6 in Distributed Manner (LMMDv6). Localized Mobility Management,in general introduces Local Mobility Agent functionality forproxying a Regional care of address that remains the same while themobile node moves within a Local Mobility Domain, which reduces thebinding update signaling latency and the signaling load outside theLocal Mobility Domain. We present a new way of forming LocalMobility Domains and Local Mobility Agents. In this protocol, LocalMobility Agent functionality is distributed across all accessrouters and a Local Mobility Domain is formed dynamically accordingto the mobile node's movement.</t>
