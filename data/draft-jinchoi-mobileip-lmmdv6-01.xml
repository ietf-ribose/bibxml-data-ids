      <t>This document presents Localized Mobility Management for Mobile IPv6 in Distributed Manner (LMMDv6). Localized Mobility Management, in general introduces Local Mobility Agent functionality for proxying a Regional care of address that remains the same while the mobile node moves within a Local Mobility Domain, which reduces the binding update signaling latency and the signaling load outside the Local Mobility Domain. We present a new way of forming Local Mobility Domains and Local Mobility Agents. In this protocol, Local Mobility Agent functionality is distributed across all access routers and a Local Mobility Domain is formed dynamically according to the mobile node's movement.</t>
