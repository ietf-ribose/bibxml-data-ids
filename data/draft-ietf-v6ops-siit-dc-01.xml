      <t>This document describes the use of the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation (SIIT) algorithm in an IPv6 Internet Data Centre (IDC). In this deployment model, traffic from legacy IPv4-only clients on the Internet is translated to IPv6 when reaches the IDC operator's network infrastructure. From that point on, it is treated just as if it was traffic from any other IPv6-capable end user. This facilitates a single-stack IPv6-only network infrastructure, as well as efficient utilisation of public IPv4 addresses. The primary audience is IDC operators who are deploying IPv6, running out of available IPv4 addresses, and/or feel that dual stack causes undesirable operational complexity.</t>
