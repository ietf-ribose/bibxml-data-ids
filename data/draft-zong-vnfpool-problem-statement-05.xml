    <abstract>
      <t>Network functions are traditionally implemented on specialized hardware rather than on general purpose servers, but there is a clear trend to implement a number of network functions, such as firewall or load balancer, as software on virtualized computing platforms. These virtualized functions are called Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs), which can be used to build network services. The use of VNFs to build network services introduces additional challenges on reliability, such as additional points of failure and the need to coordinate various VNFs. This document introduces a general idea of VNF Pool to support reliable function provision by the VNFs. We then highlight the reliability challenges and issues when using the VNFs to build services. Related IETF works are also briefly described.</t>
