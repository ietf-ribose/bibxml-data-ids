      <t>This document specifies mechanisms of NSA (Native Short Address) that enables IP packet transmission over links where the transmission of a full length address may not be desirable. This document focuses on carrying IP packets across a LLN (Low power and Lossy Network), in which the topology is relatively static where nodes' location is fixed and the connection between nodes is rather stable. The changes in the logical topology are only caused by non-frequent disconnection in the link due to some reasons. The specifications details NSA address allocation, forwarding mechanism, header format design, including length-variable fields, and IPv6 interconnection support.</t>
