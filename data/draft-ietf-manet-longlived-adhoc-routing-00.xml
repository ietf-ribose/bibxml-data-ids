      <t>This document describes the associativity-based long-livedrouting (ABR) protocol for ad hoc mobile networks. It is a simpleand bandwidth-efficient distributed routing protocols which doesnot attempt to consistently maintain routing information in everynode. In an ad hoc wireless network where mobile hosts are actingas routers and where routes are made inconsistent by mobilehosts' movement, we propose an Associativity-based routing schemewhere a route is selected based on nodes having associativitystates that imply periods of spatial, temporal, connection andsignal stability. In this manner, the routes selected are likelyto be long-lived and hence there is no need to restartfrequently, resulting in higher attainable throughput. Ourproposed protocol is based on source-initiated on-demand routing.Route requests are broadcast on a per-need basis. To discovershorten the route discovery time when the association property isviolated, the localized- query and quick-abort mechanisms arerespectively incorporated into the protocol. The associationproperty also allows the integration of ad hoc routing into abase station oriented wireless LAN environment, providing thefault tolerance in times of base station failures. This draftwill describe the protocol functions and information about packetheaders and routing tables.</t>
