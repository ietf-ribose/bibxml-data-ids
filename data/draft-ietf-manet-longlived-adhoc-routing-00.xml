      <t>This document describes the associativity-based long-lived routing (ABR) protocol for ad hoc mobile networks. It is a simple and bandwidth-efficient distributed routing protocols which does not attempt to consistently maintain routing information in every node. In an ad hoc wireless network where mobile hosts are acting as routers and where routes are made inconsistent by mobile hosts' movement, we propose an Associativity-based routing scheme where a route is selected based on nodes having associativity states that imply periods of spatial, temporal, connection and signal stability. In this manner, the routes selected are likely to be long-lived and hence there is no need to restart frequently, resulting in higher attainable throughput. Our proposed protocol is based on source-initiated on-demand routing. Route requests are broadcast on a per-need basis. To discover shorten the route discovery time when the association property is violated, the localized- query and quick-abort mechanisms are respectively incorporated into the protocol. The association property also allows the integration of ad hoc routing into a base station oriented wireless LAN environment, providing the fault tolerance in times of base station failures. This draft will describe the protocol functions and information about packet headers and routing tables.</t>
