      <t>Spam over Internet Telephony (SPIT) is one of the foreseen futureforms of spamming that SIP open-wide networks may have to handle.SPIT also has more impact on users than email spam since it is moreintrusive. Email as a store-and-forward communication mechanismallows for several filtering mechanisms to be applied to the fullcontent before being presented to the user. Session InitiationProtocol (SIP) interaction is, in contrast, real-time communicationand therefore does not provide much information prior to thetransmission of the content, making it both harder to filter and moreannoying to users. The responsibility for filtering, blocking calls,or taking any other preventive action can belong to differentelements in the call flow and may depend on various factors. Thisdocument discusses the requirements to define authorization policiesthat should allow end users or other parties to setup anti-SPITpolicies for triggering these actions. These policies typicallymatch a particular SIP communication pattern based on a number ofattributes. The range of attributes includes information provided,for example, by the SIP protocol itself, by the SIP identitymechanism, by information carried within SAML assertions or byreputation systems of social networks.</t>
