    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes enhancements to the Extensible Authentication Protocol with Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) and EAP Tunneled TLS (EAP-TTLS) to incorporate post-quantum cryptographic mechanisms. It also addresses challenges related to large certificate sizes and long certificate chains, as identified in [RFC9191], and provides recommendations for integrating PQC algorithms into EAP-TLS and EAP- TTLS deployments.</t>
