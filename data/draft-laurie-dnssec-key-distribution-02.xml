      <t>Until DNSSEC is fully deployed, so-called "islands of trust" will exist. This will lead to a large number of keys with no method within DNSSEC to manage the keys. This proposal seeks to address that issue using existing mechanisms to allow cross-signing of root (i.e. roots of islands) keys. This cross-signing of keys creates a non-hierarchical web of trust which permits the efficient gathering and validation of trust anchors.</t>
