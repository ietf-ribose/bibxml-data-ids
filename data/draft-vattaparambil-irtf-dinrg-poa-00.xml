    <abstract>
      <t>Power of Attorney (PoA) based authorization is a generic and decentralized subgranting based authorization technique. In this, a principal can grant limited credibilities for an agent to act on its behalf for some limited time and context. This can be used for example with semi autonomous devices to have them act on behalf. PoA is a self-contained document that a principal sign and directs to an agent, thereby providing it the power to execute user actions on behalf of the principal for a predefined time. As an example in this document we explain Power of Attorney based authorization technique as a decentralized solution for onboarding devices. Industrial network layer onboarding demands a technique that is efficient, scalable, and secure. PoA based onboarding enables users such as integrators and subcontractors to onboard devices permanently or temporarily according to terms and requirements set in the PoAs.</t>
