      <t>Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technique whereby a device,known as an RFID 'reader', can remotely sense the presence of, andaccess embedded memory on, a transponder known as a 'tag'. Tags may beaffixed to objects as a means of tracking the location and movement ofsaid objects within facilities equipped with RFID readers. Typically,readers communicate with upstream devices, in this document referred toas 'controllers', to receive control commands and upload read taginformation.This draft specifies the Simple Lightweight RFID Reader Protocol, orSLRRP (pronounced 'slurp'), to be used to convey configuration, control,status, and tag information between controllers and readers in an IP-based network.</t>
