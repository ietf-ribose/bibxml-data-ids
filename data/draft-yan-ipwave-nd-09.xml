    <abstract>
      <t>For Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (C-ACC), platooning and other typical use cases in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), IPv6 communication between neighbor vehicles and between vehicle and server pose the following two issues: 1) how to discover a neighbor vehicle and the demanded service; and 2) how to discover the link- layer address and other metadata of the neighbor vehicle and selected server. This document presents a solution to these problems based on DNS-SD/mDNS [RFC6762][RFC6763].</t>
