      <t>This document specifies the Proof of Process (PoP) Transcript Format, a structured data model for recording the evolutionary history of a digital document. It defines a canonical set of semantic editing events (Insertion, Deletion, Move, Replacement) and a schema for Tool Receipts, allowing distinct contributors—including human authors, AI agents, and automated editors—to cryptographically sign their specific contributions within a single provenance chain. The protocol utilizes a hash-linked Provenance DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) to ensure the integrity and ordering of events. This format enables Verifiers to reconstruct the document's lifecycle and apply flexible, policy-based logic to determine authorship attribution. It is designed to be content-aware but policy-agnostic, supporting diverse use cases ranging from academic integrity to software supply chain security.</t>
