    <abstract>
      <t>This draft outlines the pluggable module attributes within a host device. It includes representations of optical pluggable module capabilities, configuration, states, and telemetry data. These attributes draws from existing IETF standards and incorporates input from other industry forums and standards, such as ITU-T, OpenConfig, OIF and ONF TAPI, to ensure uniform structuring and consistent naming conventions. Note that the IETF terminology shall be given precedence wherever possible. In case there is a duplication of an attribute, this draft may describe how the attribute is named in the related document. Only if no attribute exists in IETF RFCs or IETF WG drafts, new attributes shall be introduced if they are needed. This draft provides a gap analysis with respect to existing IETF work in the following areas: * It provides an analysis of optical attributes in a set of IETF documents with specifications of other organizations to identify modeling gaps. * It identifies modeling needs addressing the specific aspect of pluggability of transceiver modules. The authors recognize the fact that that not all pluggable modules are coherent, not all coherent pluggable modules are DWDM capable and not all DWDM capable interfaces are implemented as pluggable modules. This analysis identifies gaps to manage the lifecycle of an optical pluggable module, from operator approval and viability assessment, to deployment, monitoring and phase-out. The lifecycle of an optical pluggable module, from operator approval and viability assessment to deployment and monitoring, is also addressed.
