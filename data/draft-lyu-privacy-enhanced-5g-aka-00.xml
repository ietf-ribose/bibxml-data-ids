    <abstract>
      <t>Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol aims to enable mutual authentication between networks and a phone equipped with a Universal Subscriber Identity Module(USIM) card. 5G AKA introduces Subscription Permanent Identifier (SUPI) and Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) to preserve user identity privacy. However, when the authentication server becomes an unsecure entity due to malwares or malicious attacks, these existing schemes cannot effectively protect user identity privacy at the server-end. For a small number of important users with high demand for identity privacy and security, comprehensive identity privacy protection is one of their important security requirements. Based on a security assumption that the server is trustworthy within a limited time, this document proposes a privacy-enhanced access authentication scheme (PEAA) which is compatible with 5G AKA. This scheme not only achieves user anonymity on wireless channels by dynamic temporary pseudonyms, but also ensures that the server authenticates users without their permanent identities. In the context of hierarchical security requirements, PEAA scheme and the existing 5G AKA can respectively provide different user identity privacy protection services for users with different security requirements.</t>
