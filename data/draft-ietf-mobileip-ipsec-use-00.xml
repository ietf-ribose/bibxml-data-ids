      <t>The use of IPSec ESP protocol in the Mobile IP packet redirection tunnels will protect the redirected packets against both passive and active attacks launched and aid these packets to traverse the firewalls surrounding both the home and the foreign subnets visited by the mobile nodes. This document proposes a scheme to negotiate the use of IPSec ESP on selected Mobile IP tunnels and a procedure to establish these tunnels with the aid of automatic key and security association management protocol such as ISAKMP.</t>
