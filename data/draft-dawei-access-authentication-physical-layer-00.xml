      <t>This document specifies the uniform expression and format of different kinds of wireless radio frequency fingerprints. It also specifies the structure and functions of wireless authentication framework on fingerprints, including the specification of the signal frames' structure. This document is applicable to the construction and management of secure access at the edge of the Internet of things. This document assumes that the reader is familiar with some concepts and details regarding physical layer security.</t>
