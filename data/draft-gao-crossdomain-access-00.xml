    <abstract>
      <t>Access control is one of the major security concerns for Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN). As LLNs are normally highly distributed and resource-constrained, conventional access control systems that rely on the central Certificate Authority (CA) and sophisticated cryptographic algorithms are not suitable for them. Furthermore, LLNs may consist of embedded devices with limited power, memory, and processing resources from different manufacturers or service providers. Due to the different specifications and designs, it is difficult to ensure consistency in security implementation among all devices. This document proposes a distributed access control method based on local authorization decisions, which takes both the single- domain and the multi-domain situation into account.</t>
