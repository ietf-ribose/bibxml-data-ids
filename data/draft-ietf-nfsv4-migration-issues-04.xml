      <t>The migration feature of NFSv4 provides for moving responsibility for a single filesystem from one server to another, without disruption to clients. Recent implementation experience has shown problems in the existing specification for this feature. This document discusses the issues which have arisen, explores the options available for curing the issues, and explains the choices made in updating the NFSv4.0 and NFSv4.1 specifications, to address migration.</t>
