    <abstract>
      <t>This document discusses the requirement to autonomic nodes supporting information distribution based over GRASP in autonomic networks. In general, information distribution can be categorized into two different modes: 1) one autonomic node instantly sends information to other nodes in the domain; 2) one autonomic node publishes some information and asynchronously some other interested nodes request the published information. In the former case, information data will be generated and consumed instantly. In the latter case, information data live longer in the network. These capabilities are basic and fundamental to an autonomous network system (i.e. ANI [I-D.ietf-anima-reference-model]). This document clarifies possible use cases of information distribution in ANI and requirements to ANI so that rich information distribution can be natively supported. Extensions to autonomic nodes are proposed and detailed embodiments based on GRASP are discussed.</t>
