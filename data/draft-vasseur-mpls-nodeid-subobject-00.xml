      <t>In the context of MPLS TE Fast Reroute ([FAST-REROUTE]), the Merge Point (MP) address is required at the Point of Local Repair (PLR) in order to select a backup tunnel intersecting a protected Traffic Engineering LSP on a downstream LSR. However, existing protocol mechanisms are not sufficient to find MP address multi-areas or multi-domain routing network. Hence, the current MPLS Fast Reroute mechanism cannot be used to protect inter-area or inter-AS TE LSPs from a failure of an ABR (Area Border Router) or ASBR (Autonomous System Border Router) respectively. This document specifies the use of existing RRO IPv4 and IPv6 subobjects (with a new flag defined) to define the node-id subobject in order to solve this issue.</t>
