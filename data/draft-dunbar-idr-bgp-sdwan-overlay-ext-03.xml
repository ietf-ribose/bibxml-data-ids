      <t>The document defines a new BGP SAFI with a new NLRI in order to advertise a SD-WAN node's properties with other SD-WAN nodes through third party untrusted networks. The goal is for SD-WAN network to scale; enabling SD-WAN overlay among large number of SD-WAN nodes with minimal provisioning, and allow services to be carried by different SD-WAN transport networks based on user specified criteria. A "SD-WAN" network consists of many segments of IPsec tunnels between SD-WAN nodes. An "end-point" is referring to a port on a SD- WAN node throughout this document. This document specifies new sub-TLVs for the SD-WAN End Point's Attributes.</t>
