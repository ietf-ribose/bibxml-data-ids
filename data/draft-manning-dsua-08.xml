      <t>This document lists most of the existent special use prefixes from the IPv4 space that have been registered with the IANA and now RIRs and provides some suggestions for operational procedures when these prefixes are encountered. This document does not address IPv4 space that is not registered with the IANA/RIRs for special use or address space that is reserved for future delegation in the operational Internet. Notice is given to prefixes that manufacturers have co-opted.</t>
