    <abstract>
      <t>Global IPv6 deployment is expected. Many solutions have been specified in order to provide IPv6 connectivity service. In order to provide IPv6 connectivity service to all kinds of host/client devices, ISP networks may need to support as many as possible IPv6 connectivity solutions. This document proposes a hybrid ISP framework that supports the coexistence of various IPv6 connectivity solutions and analyses the configuration requirements raised by this framework. Additionally, the applicability of different configuration mechanisms for performing this configuration is discussed.</t>
