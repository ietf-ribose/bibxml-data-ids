      <t>This memo specifies an upward-compatible extension to the OSI End System--Intermediate System routing protocol (ISO 9542:1988) to allow end systems which are autoconfiguring their network layer (NSAP) addresses to suggest a value to be used as the System ID. It is primarily intended for use in the TUBA environment, but is also applicable to a CATNIP or pure OSI environment as well. This document specifies an experimental protocol for use in the Internet. In addition, this document will be submitted to ISO for consideration as an addendum to the ISO 9542 standard. Two interoperable implementations of this protocol extension currently exist.</t>
