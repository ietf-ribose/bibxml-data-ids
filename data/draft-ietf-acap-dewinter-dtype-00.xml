      <t>The Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) is designed to support remote storage and access of program option, configuration and preference information. In certain circumstances, it is desirable or necessary to deal with information that has a limit imposed on it. While the general ACAP specification does provide for a (SYNTAX) alert to inform the submittor that the stored information was not in a valid syntax for that field, there is no generic method to discover that syntax. There is strong feeling in the ACAP working group that variable length strings should be used for data where possible, but there is also the knowledge that ACAP will be used to configure and access existing systems where the use of such variable length strings may be difficult or impossible.</t>
