      <t>This draft proposes a scheme that allows a mobile node to register aprimary care-of address(CoA) as well as one or more non-primary CoAsby sending a single binding update message to the home agent and/orcorrespondent node. This is achieved by using two new mobilityoptions defined in this draft. Mobile nodes that perform duplicateaddress detection procedure, such as Advance DAD and Optimistic DADcan benefit from this scheme. Proposed scheme does not require toexchange CoTI and CoT messages, usually required for the registrationof each of the non-primary CoA(s). It also does not require tomaintain binding management key for each of the non-primary CoA(s).Thus the proposed scheme reduces the signaling and processingoverhead in Mobile IPv6 networks.</t>
