    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes a scheme that allows a mobile node to register a primary care-of address(CoA) as well as one or more non-primary CoAs by sending a single binding update message to the home agent and/or correspondent node. This is achieved by using two new mobility options defined in this draft. Mobile nodes that perform duplicate address detection procedure, such as Advance DAD and Optimistic DAD can benefit from this scheme. Proposed scheme does not require to exchange CoTI and CoT messages, usually required for the registration of each of the non-primary CoA(s). It also does not require to maintain binding management key for each of the non-primary CoA(s). Thus the proposed scheme reduces the signaling and processing overhead in Mobile IPv6 networks.</t>
