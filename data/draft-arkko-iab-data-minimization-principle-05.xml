      <t>Data minimization is an important privacy technique, as it can reduce the amount information exposed about a user. This document emphasizes the need for data minimization among primary protocol participants, such as between clients and servers. Avoiding data leakage to outside parties is of course very important as well, but both need to be considered in minimization. This is because is necessary to protect against endpoints that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply do not align with the interests of users. It is important to consider the role of a participant and limit any data provided to it according to that role.</t>
