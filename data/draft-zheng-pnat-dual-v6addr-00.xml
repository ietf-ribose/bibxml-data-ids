      <t>This document describes a derived PNAT mechanism that hosts do notneed IPv4 addresses, neither public, private nor faked IPv4 address.PNAT solution was first proposed by Huang &amp; Deng in [PNAT], whichprovides application-level transparency for hosts in IPv4 and IPv6hybrid environments via host-based IPv4/IPv6 translation technique. This specification addresses one of the PNAT scenarios where a hostis provided IPv6 only network connectivity. Two IPv6 addresses willbe assigned to a PNAT host. One is native IPv6 address, and the otheris a PNAT IPv6 address. In this case, IPv4- originated communicationsstill need to be translated into IPv6. However, the host does notneed to be assigned an IPv4 address. Instead, a PNAT IPv6 addresswill take the place of the originally required IPv4 address.Twoformats of PNAT IPv6 address,4rd (IPv4 Rapid Deployment) address and4rm (IPv4 Rapid Migration) address, are defined.The advantage of the derived PNAT mechanism is that such IPv6 PNAThost supports both IPv4 and IPv6 applications, with SIMPLICITY,SCALABILITY and without worrying about any IPv4 address allocatingissue.</t>
