      <t>In this document we consider and analyse the specific scenario of IPv6 transition and deployment in a large department of a university campus network. The department is large enough to operate its own instances of all the conventional university services including (for example) web, DNS, email, filestore, interactive logins, and remote and wireless access. The scenario is a dual-stack one, i.e. transition to IPv6 means deploying IPv6 in the first instance (and probably for some time) alongside IPv4. This analysis identifies the available components for IPv6 transition, while validating the applicability of the IPv6 Enterprise Network Scenarios informational text. It focuses on the network and associated service elements of the transition, rather than the application elements.</t>
