      <t>Service Function Chain architecture further enables the modularity of network functions; network service functions can be split and chained together to compose complicated services. Network automation relies on a specific orchestrator to automatically deploy an end2end service or application. If this end2end service or application has a specific requirement to chaining several service functions, there is a need of an interface from the application to inform the orchestrator. This document investigates the problem.</t>
