    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a mechanism for extensible delegations in the DNS. The mechanism realizes delegations with SVCB resource record sets placed below a _deleg label in the apex of the delegating zone. This authoritative delegation point can be aliased to other names using CNAME and DNAME. The mechanism inherits extensibility from SVCB. Support in recursive resolvers suffices for the mechanism to be fully functional. The number of subsequent interactions between the recursive resolver and the authoritative name servers is comparable with those for DNS Query Name Minimisation. Additionally, but not required, support in the authoritative name servers enables optimized behavior with reduced (simultaneous) queries. None, mixed or full deployment of the mechanism on authoritative name servers are all fully functional, allowing for the mechanism to be incrementally deployed.</t>
