    <abstract>
      <t>It is widely recognized that it has become very difficult to introduce new transport protocols on the Internet. On reason to this is that there are no agreed-upon way for a source end host to find out whether there is support for a particular transport protocol along the network path from itself to a destination end host or not. This document describes a Happy Eyeballs framework that generalizes previously proposed Happy Eyeballs mechanisms to include a transport protocol, the configuration of this transport protocol, as well as a transport address, i.e., to include complete transport solutions. The described Happy Eyeballs framework is not only useful in the design and implementation of mechanisms that are to determine the support of particular transport solutions, but also for the design of mechanisms that are to select the transport solution, which, according to some criteria, is the most appropriate one to use.</t>
