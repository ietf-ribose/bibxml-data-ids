      <t>This document describes the service-specific implementation and requirements for Pseudo-Wire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) of TDM circuits using SONET/SDH payload formats. This draft extends SONET/SDH SPE emulation proposal [CEP-SPE], providing SONET VT1.5/2/3/6 and SDH VC-11/12/2 circuit emulation. This draft also provides bandwidth saving modes for SONET STS-1 and SDH VC-3/4 carrying tributaries or asynchronous T3/E3 signals. This proposal is optimized for VT level cross connect applications, for PDH to SONET/SDH emulation and for carrying PDH circuits across a PSN. The applicability statement for TDM circuit emulation (PDH and SONET/SDH) is described in [TDM-APP]. This draft discusses the emulation of these circuits over packet networks using IP or MPLS.</t>
