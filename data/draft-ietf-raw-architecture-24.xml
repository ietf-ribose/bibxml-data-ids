      <t>Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) extends the reliability and availability of DetNet to networks composed of any combination of wired and wireless segments. The RAW Architecture leverages and extends RFC 8655, the Deterministic Networking Architecture, to adapt to challenges that affect prominently the wireless medium, notably intermittent transmission loss. This document defines a network control loop that optimizes the use of constrained bandwidth and energy while assuring the expected DetNet services. The loop involves a new Point of Local Repair (PLR) function in the DetNet service sublayer that dynamically selects the DetNet path(s) for packets to route around local connectivity degradation.</t>
