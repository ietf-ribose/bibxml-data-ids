    <abstract>
      <t>A proposal is made to carry Synchronous Transport Signal(STS-N) services over packetized networks, in particular over IPnetworks. This has the potential to dramatically lower the price,ease the provisioning and grooming, and improve managability ofdelivering these types of circuits. Two proposals are put forth fordiscussion on how STS services could be transported over an IPnetwork. The first proposal, referred to as SPE1/IP, is to break OC-Nsignals down into their STS-1 blocks, identify the SPE components andpacketize these for transmission across a packet network. The secondproposal, referred to as STSc/IP breaks down the STS signal into theunderlying concatenated services and transports configurable lengthsegments of the signal to the far end of the data network. Witheither of these approaches, different STS-N services on a given portcan be connected to different ports across the network and thenetwork will groom them onto the most optimal path available.</t>
