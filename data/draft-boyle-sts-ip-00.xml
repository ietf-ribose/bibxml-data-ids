      <t>A proposal is made to carry Synchronous Transport Signal (STS-N) services over packetized networks, in particular over IP networks. This has the potential to dramatically lower the price, ease the provisioning and grooming, and improve managability of delivering these types of circuits. Two proposals are put forth for discussion on how STS services could be transported over an IP network. The first proposal, referred to as SPE1/IP, is to break OC-N signals down into their STS-1 blocks, identify the SPE components and packetize these for transmission across a packet network. The second proposal, referred to as STSc/IP breaks down the STS signal into the underlying concatenated services and transports configurable length segments of the signal to the far end of the data network. With either of these approaches, different STS-N services on a given port can be connected to different ports across the network and the network will groom them onto the most optimal path available.</t>
