      <t>This memo describes the use of so called store-and-forward cryptographic transforms within the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP). The motivation is to support use cases when two end-points communicate via one (or more) store-and-forward middleboxes that are not fully trusted to access the media content. One of the main aspects of the transform is to make the confidentiality and message authentication independent of the RTP header. Another central aspect is to enable identification of the cryptographic context (keys etc.). Besides the security of the end- points, also trust assumptions regarding the store-and-forward middleboxes are addressed.</t>
