      <t>The Mobile Application Part (MAP) protocol is a signaling protocolfor cellular networks. The MAP Security (MAPSEC) protocol providesa secure way to transport MAP messages. To use MAPSEC, however,Security Associations (SAs) are needed. This document defines howsuch SAs can be created automatically. We use the InternetSecurity Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) as aframework for managing SAs and establishing keys. The frameworkcan be specialized to a particular task. Such a specialization iscalled a Domain of Interpretation (DOI), and this document definesthe MAPSEC DOI. This specialization is very similar to theInternet Key Exchange protocol and the ISAKMP specialization forIP Security, except that non-IP protocols are being negotiated.</t>
