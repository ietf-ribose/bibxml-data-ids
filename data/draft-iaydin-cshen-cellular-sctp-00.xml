      <t>This document describes a transport-layer mobility solution for theInternet termed Cellular SCTP, or cSCTP for short, based on theemerging Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). We suggested touse `two primary addresses simultaneously' by duplicating the packettransmissions (while halving the transmission rate) during handoff toprovide `soft' handover. Moreover, we described the inter-working ofcSCTP with Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to facilitate locationmanagement function when Correspondent Nodes (CNs) initiate theassociations and need to locate Mobile Nodes (MNs).</t>
