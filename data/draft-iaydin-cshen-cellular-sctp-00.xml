      <t>This document describes a transport-layer mobility solution for the Internet termed Cellular SCTP, or cSCTP for short, based on the emerging Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). We suggested to use `two primary addresses simultaneously' by duplicating the packet transmissions (while halving the transmission rate) during handoff to provide `soft' handover. Moreover, we described the inter-working of cSCTP with Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to facilitate location management function when Correspondent Nodes (CNs) initiate the associations and need to locate Mobile Nodes (MNs).</t>
