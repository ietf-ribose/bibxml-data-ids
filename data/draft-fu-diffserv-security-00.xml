      <t>This document provides a security analysis for the differentiatedservice framework. We studied what kinds of attacks can be performedand how badly attacks can affect network services under the DiffServframework. Without a careful investigation of potential attacks andimpacts, the protection systems can not be effectively developed andevaluated. The DiffServ working group, as a whole, needs to decidewhat the important security issues are (or what specific attacks weneed to defend against). Then, it will be meaningful to discuss thepossible solution to those realistic DiffServ vulnerabilities. Ourobjective in this report is to define a model for denial of serviceattacks under the DiffServ framework.</t>
