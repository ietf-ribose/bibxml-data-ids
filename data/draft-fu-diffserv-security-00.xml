      <t>This document provides a security analysis for the differentiated service framework. We studied what kinds of attacks can be performed and how badly attacks can affect network services under the DiffServ framework. Without a careful investigation of potential attacks and impacts, the protection systems can not be effectively developed and evaluated. The DiffServ working group, as a whole, needs to decide what the important security issues are (or what specific attacks we need to defend against). Then, it will be meaningful to discuss the possible solution to those realistic DiffServ vulnerabilities. Our objective in this report is to define a model for denial of service attacks under the DiffServ framework.</t>
