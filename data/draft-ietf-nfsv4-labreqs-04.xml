      <t>This memo outlines high-level requirements for the integration of flexible Mandatory Access Control (MAC) functionality into the Network File System (NFS) version 4.2 (NFSv4.2). It describes the level of protections that should be provided over protocol components and the basic structure of the proposed system. The intent here is not to present the protocol changes, but to describe the environment in which they reside.</t>
