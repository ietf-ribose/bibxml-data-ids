    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the Wireless Broadband Alliance's OpenRoaming system. The OpenRoaming architectures enables a seamless onboarding experience for devices connecting to access networks that are part of the federation of access networks and identity providers. The primary objective of this document is to describe the protocols that form the foundation for this architecture, enabling providers to correctly configure their equipment to support interoperable OpenRoaming signalling exchanges. In addition, the topic of OpenRoaming has been raised in different IETF working groups, and therefore a secondary objective is to assist those discussions by describing the federation organization and framework.</t>
