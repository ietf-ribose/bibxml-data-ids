      <t>This draft proposes a dynamic Mobile Network Prefix (MNP) delegation extension for Mobile IPv6 protocol to enable MNP delegation for mobile networks. A MNP is an IPv6 prefix used in a mobile network. The extension supports dynamic delegation, return, refreshing and updating operations related to MNP delegation operations between a Mobile Router (MR) of a mobile network and the MR's Home Agent (HA). This extension is proposed, because there is a lack for a dynamic MNP delegation protocol related to mobile networks, and currently MNPs have to be assigned statically to enable mobile networking.</t>
