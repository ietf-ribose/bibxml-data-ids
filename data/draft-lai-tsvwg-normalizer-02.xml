    <abstract>
      <t>In DiffServ, preferential dropping of packets in AF PHB groups has long been considered beneficial, typically for video flows with discardable packets. Unfortunately, the ecosystem of bandwidth contention at congestion is very likely to discourage those video endpoints from generating packets with lower precedence markings, i.e. they would lose more packets if doing so. Thus, to offer an incentive for more collaborative and mutually beneficial behaviors of video endpoints in AF PHB groups, we propose a Normalization Marker (NM) for traffic conditioning at network edges. Deployment of NM will encourage the video endpoints to generate finer layers of intra- flow precedence (IFP) with discardable packets in more balanced distributions.</t>
