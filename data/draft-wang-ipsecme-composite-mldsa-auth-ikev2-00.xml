      <t>This draft specifies composite ML-DSA authentication in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) [RFC7296]. Namely, the authenticaiton in the IKEv2 is completed by using a compiste signature of ML-DSA [FIPS203], the newly post-quantum digital singature standard, and one of the following traditional singature algorithms, SA-PKCS#1v1.5, RSA-PSS, ECDSA, Ed25519, and Ed448. These concrete composite algorithm specifications follow [OGPKF24]. Composite ML-DSA authenticatio is achieved by asking to add a new value in the "IKEv2 Authentication Method" registry [IANA-IKEv2], mantained by IANA. After that, two peers MUST send the SUPPORTED_AUTH_METHODS Notify, defined in [RFC9593], to negotiate the specific composite ML-DSA algoithms. [EDNOTE: Code points for composite ML-DSA authentication may need to be assigned in the "IKEv2 Authentication Method" registry, maintained by IANA]</t>
