    <abstract>
      <t>In AI training scenarios, the current mainstream load balancing technology is per-flow ECMP. However, hash collision issues lead to imbalanced traffic distribution, adversely affecting application performance. To address this problem, this document proposes an enhanced ECMP method that resolves load imbalance caused by hash collisions. The proposed solution effectively improves load balancing efficiency, reduces network congestion, and enhances overall network performance.</t>
