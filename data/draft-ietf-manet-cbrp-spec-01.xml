      <t>Cluster Based Routing Protocol (CBRP) is a routing protocol designedfor use in mobile ad hoc networks. The protocol divides the nodes ofthe ad hoc network into a number of overlapping or disjoint 2-hop-diameter clusters in a distributed manner. A cluster head is electedfor each cluster to maintain cluster membership information. Inter-cluster routes are discovered dynamically using the clustermembership information kept at each cluster head. By clusteringnodes into groups, the protocol efficiently minimizes the floodingtraffic during route discovery and speeds up this process as well.Furthermore, the protocol takes into consideration the existence ofuni-directional links and uses these links for both intra-cluster andinter-cluster routing.</t>
