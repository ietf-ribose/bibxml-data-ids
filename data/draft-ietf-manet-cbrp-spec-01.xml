      <t>Cluster Based Routing Protocol (CBRP) is a routing protocol designed for use in mobile ad hoc networks. The protocol divides the nodes of the ad hoc network into a number of overlapping or disjoint 2-hop- diameter clusters in a distributed manner. A cluster head is elected for each cluster to maintain cluster membership information. Inter- cluster routes are discovered dynamically using the cluster membership information kept at each cluster head. By clustering nodes into groups, the protocol efficiently minimizes the flooding traffic during route discovery and speeds up this process as well. Furthermore, the protocol takes into consideration the existence of uni-directional links and uses these links for both intra-cluster and inter-cluster routing.</t>
