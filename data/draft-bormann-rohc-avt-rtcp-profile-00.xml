      <t>This document specifies a ROHC (Robust Header Compression) profile for compression of RTCP packets. The profile, called ROHC-RTCP, provides efficient and robust compression of RTCP packets, including frequently used RTCP features. ROHC-RTCP is intended to be used in conjunction with ROHC profiles for the compression of RTP headers such as RFC 3905 and ROHCv2, making use of context replication (RFC 4164) where appropriate. In particular, ROHC-RTCP is intended to remove the need for standardization of special-purpose variants of RTCP for applications just because these also need to work over low-speed links.</t>
