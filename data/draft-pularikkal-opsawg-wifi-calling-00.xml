      <t>Carrier Wi-Fi Calling is a solution that allows mobile operators to seamlessly offload mobile voice signaling and bearer traffic onto Wi- Fi access networks, which may or may not be managed by the mobile operators. Mobile data offload onto Wi-Fi access networks has already become very common, as Wi-Fi access has become more ubiquitous. However, the offload of mobile voice traffic onto Wi-Fi networks has become prevalent only in recent years. This was primarily driven by the native Wi-Fi Calling client support introduced by device vendors. The objective of this document is to provide a high level deployment reference to Mobile Operators and Wi- Fi Operators on Carrier Wi-Fi Calling.</t>
