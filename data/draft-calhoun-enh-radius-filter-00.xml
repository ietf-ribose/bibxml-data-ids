      <t>This specification defines an extension to the Enhanced RADIUS protocol [1]. As the dial-up services grow in complexity, there is a need for a user's filters to change dynamically, which could be initiated via an out-of-band request from the user to the RADIUS server or by the RADIUS server itself.</t>
