    <abstract>
      <t>In a tightly coupled conference, conference participants can communicate with the conference policy server using a conference policy control protocol (CPCP). This document generally describes how to use CPCP to efficiently provide and augment interaction between clients and conference policy server. This document describes what information is needed for conference policy control, and what operation is needed to manipulate and interact with the policy information. It is noted that the purpose of this draft is not to suggest a new mechanism of CPCP, but to suggest building block approach to CPCP work.</t>
