      <t>The purpose of this document is to elicit discussion on configuration schemes for determining the domain name to be used by NFSv4 implementations that do not natively support users and groups from multiple domains. This document also describes a method by which NFSv4 clients and servers can discover a domain name value appropriate for qualifying NFSv4 user and group names, by leveraging DNS TXT resource records.</t>
