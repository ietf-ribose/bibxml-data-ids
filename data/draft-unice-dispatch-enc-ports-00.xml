      <t>The internet and free flow of information has enabled the individual in society several advantages that have not been available in the past. The free flow of information has enabled social and political changes, open education for students, and now the free-flow of money without the need for intermediate institutions. This free flow of information etc. is continually under attack from institutions that are compromised by the Internet. So these institutions have and continue to implement controls in an attempt to stop the empowerment of the individual. These controls on information is what this RFC attempts to weaken.</t>
