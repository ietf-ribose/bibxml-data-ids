      <t>CASP is a modular potocol for establishing network control state along adata path between two nodes communicating on the Internet.The signalling problem addressed by CASP is the same as the overallproblem being addressed by the NSIS activities.The CASP framework is defined as a modular protocol, which includes ageneral purpose messaging layer (M-layer), which supports a number ofclient layers for particular signalling applications (e.g. QoS, MIDCOM).In addition there is distinct, special purpose client component fornext-peer discovery.</t>
