      <t>CASP is a modular potocol for establishing network control state along a data path between two nodes communicating on the Internet. The signalling problem addressed by CASP is the same as the overall problem being addressed by the NSIS activities. The CASP framework is defined as a modular protocol, which includes a general purpose messaging layer (M-layer), which supports a number of client layers for particular signalling applications (e.g. QoS, MIDCOM). In addition there is distinct, special purpose client component for next-peer discovery.</t>
