      <t>RFC 3552 introduces a threat model that does not include endpointsecurity. Yet increasingly protocol development is making assumptionsabout endpoint security capabilities which have not been defined. RFC3552 is 17 years old and threat landscape has changed. Security issuesand cyber attacks have increased and there are more devices, users, andapplications on the endpoint than ever. This draft proposes a newapproach to the Internet threat model which will include endpointsecurity, focus on users and provide an update to the threat model inRFC 3552. It brings together Security Considerations for ProtocolDesigners draft-lazanski-protocol-sec-design-model-t-01 which is acomprehensive document that lists threats, attack vectors, examples andconsiderations for designing protocols, as well as draft-taddei-smart-cless-introduction-02 which lays out security concerns, capabilitiesand limitations for endpoints in general and draft-mcfadden-smart-endpoint-taxonomy-for-cless-01 which outlines a clear taxonomy forendpoint security and identifies changes in technology, economic andprotocol development that has impacted and changed endpoint security.Taken together these drafts reflect a comprehensive and clear set ofsecurity threats and design considerations for the Internet.</t>
