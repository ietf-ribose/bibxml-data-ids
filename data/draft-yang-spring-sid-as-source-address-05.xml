    <abstract>
      <t>In SRv6 network, the SRv6 packets usually use loopback address as source address. However, when there is symmetric traffic requirement for bidirectional flow, or there is requirement for traffic source validation, using loopback address as source address is not sufficient. This document proposes using SID as source address for SRv6 traffic, also identifies solution for several use cases.</t>
