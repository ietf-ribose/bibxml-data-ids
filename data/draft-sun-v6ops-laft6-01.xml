      <t>With the approaching exhaustion of IPv4 address space, large-scaleISPs are now facing the option to deploy IPv6 in a timely manner.However, most existing IPv6 transition solutions have tradeoffbetween scalability and efficiency. This draft proposes a lightweightaddress family transition mechanism named LAFT6. It only needs tomaintain per-subscriber state entries in core network and there is nospecific address format requirement for users' IPv6 address. It is alightweight solution in terms of state-management, addressing androuting. The experimental results have shown that LAFT6 is scalableand can be rapidly deployed in commercial ISP network.</t>
