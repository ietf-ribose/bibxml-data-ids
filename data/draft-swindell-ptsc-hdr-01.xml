      <t>Anyone that has dealt at length with plain (ASCII [1]) text and source code files can testify that the lack of a global definition of the effect of the horizontal-tab character, all too often, causes ill-formed display and printed output of plain text files that utilize the horizontal-tab character for formatting. This document defines a common header for plain text and source code (PT/SC) files, whose primary purpose is to specify the tab-dependant formatting parameters to be used when displaying, printing, or editing such files. The defined header also addresses such issues as whether to use the line-feed character or carriage-return/line- feed character sequence to terminate lines in the file. Widespread adoption and support of the header defined in this document could substantially improve the interoperability of text and source code files distributed across the Internet and other mediums.</t>
