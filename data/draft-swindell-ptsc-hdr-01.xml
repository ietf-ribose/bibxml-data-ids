      <t>Anyone that has dealt at length with plain (ASCII [1]) text andsource code files can testify that the lack of a global definitionof the effect of the horizontal-tab character, all too often, causesill-formed display and printed output of plain text files thatutilize the horizontal-tab character for formatting.This document defines a common header for plain text and source code(PT/SC) files, whose primary purpose is to specify the tab-dependantformatting parameters to be used when displaying, printing, orediting such files. The defined header also addresses such issuesas whether to use the line-feed character or carriage-return/line-feed character sequence to terminate lines in the file. Widespreadadoption and support of the header defined in this document couldsubstantially improve the interoperability of text and source codefiles distributed across the Internet and other mediums.</t>
