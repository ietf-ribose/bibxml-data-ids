    <abstract>
      <t>Nameserver selection algorithms employed by DNS resolvers are not currently standardized in the DNS protocol, and this has lead to variation in the methods being used by implementations in the field. Recent research has shown that some of these implementations suffer from significant security vulnerabilities. This document provides an in-depth analysis of nameserver selection utilized by mainstream DNS software and summarizes uncovered vulnerabilities. Furthermore, it provides recommendations to defend against these security and availability risks. Designers and operators of recursive resolvers can adopt these recommendations to improve the security and stability of the DNS.</t>
