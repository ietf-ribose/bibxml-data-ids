      <t>The Source Address Validation Improvement (SAVI) was developed to prevent IP source address spoofing which can enable impersonation and malicious traffic redirection. An Internet Service Provider (ISP) who provides Internet access services, information services and value- added services to the customers should guarantee security of its network and customers' privacy. Thus, the mechanism is essential for ISPs. However, due to a diversity of ISPs' access network, SAVI solution is also different accordingly. This document describes five scenarios of ISPs'IPv6 access network, and moreover, states its SAVI requirements and according tentative solutions.</t>
