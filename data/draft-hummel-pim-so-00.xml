      <t>This draft addresses several aspects of multicast services like IP- based TV but also like n-party conferences. It breaks with traditional concepts: An IP-based TV-broadcast's delivery tree shall be identified by the source address S and a Multicast-ID provided by S. The same shall apply to each from n well correlated point-to(n-1)point delivery trees of a small n-party conference. Consequently, a TV-host may send out more than one program and any user-host may participate in more than one conference. Mapping to a globally unique multicast group address G is not needed, would be complex, and does not work. QoS/Policy-Routing, the degree of state (Layer-3, Layer-3 plus MPLS- label, or no state), and several more aspects need to be respected HOMOGENEOUSLY all over the entire delivery tree. This cannot be provided by reverse path setup while depending on each receiver's guesses. Therefore, the tree (i.e. an initial tree as well as additional branches at a later time) must be established in downstream direction. No RP- and no BSR-routers are required.</t>
