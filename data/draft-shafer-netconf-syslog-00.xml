      <t>SYSLOG is the most prevalent mechanism for delivering event notification data off networking devices. NETCONF is intended to provide a standard mechanism for performing configuration operations on networking devices. The two areas will overlap, giving rise to a need for receiving notification data over NETCONF. This document presents a simple mechanism for accessing SYSLOG data over NETCONF, implemented using the existing NETCONF RPC infrastructure.</t>
