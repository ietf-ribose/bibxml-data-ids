      <t>This document proposes a solution, referred as SNIF, that provides the means for any Internet connected device to: * allocate a globally unique anonymous hostname; * obtain and maintain a publicly trusted X.509 certificate issued for the allocated hostname; * accept incoming TLS connections on specific TCP ports of the allocated hostname from any TLS clients that are capable of sending Server Name Indication. The private key associated with the X.509 certificate is securely stored on the TLS terminating device, and is never exposed to any other party at any step of the process.
