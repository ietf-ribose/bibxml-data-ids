      <t>This document introduces a mechanism enabling DKIM-signing domain owners to solicit comprehensive aggregate reports from email receivers. Presented in an XML format, these reports possess adaptable elements conducive for integration with current and future drafts and standards like DMARCbis. They capture the evaluation outcomes of DKIM signatures, such as 'pass' or 'fail', alongside other potential data attributes. Receivers can relay these aggregate reports to destinations designated by the DKIM-signing domain holder, contingent upon their support capabilities.</t>
