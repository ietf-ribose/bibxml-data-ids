      <t>The compression of domain names in DNS messages was introduced in [RFC1035]. Although some remarks were made about applicability to future defined resource record types, no method has been deployed yet to support interoperable DNS compression for RR types specified since then. This document summarizes current problems and proposes a new compression scheme to be applied to future RR types, which supports interoperability. Also, suggestions are made how to deal with RR types defined so far.</t>
