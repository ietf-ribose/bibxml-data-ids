      <t>Packet loss is undesirable for real-time multimedia sessions, but it is not avoidable due to congestion or other unplanned network outages. This is especially the case for IP multicast networks. One technique to recover from packet loss without incurring unbounded delay for all the receivers is to duplicate the packets and send them in separate redundant streams. This document explains how RTP streams can be duplicated without breaking RTP and RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) rules.</t>
