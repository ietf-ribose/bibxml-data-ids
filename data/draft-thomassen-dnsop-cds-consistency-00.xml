      <t>For maintaining DNSSEC Delegation Trust, DS records have to be kept up to date. [RFC7344] automates this by having the child publish CDS and/or CDNSKEY records which hold the prospective DS parameters. Parent-side entities (e.g. Registries, Registrars) can use these records to update the delegation's DS records. A common method for detecting changes in CDS/CDNSKEY record sets is to query them periodically from the child zone ("polling"), as described in Section 6.1 of [RFC7344]. This document specifies that if polling is used, parent-side entities MUST ensure that CDS/CDNSKEY record sets are equivalent across all of the child's authoritative nameservers, before taking any action based on these records.</t>
