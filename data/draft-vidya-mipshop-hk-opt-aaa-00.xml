      <t>AAA-HK [1] provides a method for a MN and an AR to establish a sharedkey using a AAA server. To ensure that the round trip to the AAAserver does not delay handoff, the handover key must be derivedindependent of and well ahead of the actual handoff, preferablyimmediately after moving to a new access router. This documentdescribes one such method of optimizing the handover key derivationby using an AR as an authenticating server, once the MN and AR haveestablished a security association.</t>
