      <t>AAA-HK [1] provides a method for a MN and an AR to establish a shared key using a AAA server. To ensure that the round trip to the AAA server does not delay handoff, the handover key must be derived independent of and well ahead of the actual handoff, preferably immediately after moving to a new access router. This document describes one such method of optimizing the handover key derivation by using an AR as an authenticating server, once the MN and AR have established a security association.</t>
