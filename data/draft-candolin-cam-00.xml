      <t>Most protocols and applications are designed for connections that arefairly static. When a node changes its point of attachment to theInternet frequently, it must be able to rapidly adapt to the newenvironment. Traditionally, each application and protocol tries to dothis independently of each other. In some cases, applications havebeen tailored to communicate with one other protocol layer to noticesuch changes. The main problem with this approach is that adding newprotocols and applications to the node cannot be made in a genericway. In order to obtain at least some level of context awareness,protocols and applications must be specifically tailored tointercommunicate. This also adds complexity to application and protocoldesign, since protocols and applications perform a wide range of tasksfor which they have not originally been designed. To overcome theseproblems, we add a new Context Aware Management (CAM) layer to theInternet Protocol stack. The purpose of CAM is to optimize thefunctionality of the node by monitoring the environment for changesand by adapting the behavior of the node accordingly. The protocolsand applications thus perform the tasks for which they have beendesigned in the first place, and CAM makes the decisions regardingwhich protocols to use and with what parameters.</t>
