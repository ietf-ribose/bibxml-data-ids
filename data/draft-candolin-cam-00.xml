      <t>Most protocols and applications are designed for connections that are fairly static. When a node changes its point of attachment to the Internet frequently, it must be able to rapidly adapt to the new environment. Traditionally, each application and protocol tries to do this independently of each other. In some cases, applications have been tailored to communicate with one other protocol layer to notice such changes. The main problem with this approach is that adding new protocols and applications to the node cannot be made in a generic way. In order to obtain at least some level of context awareness, protocols and applications must be specifically tailored to intercommunicate. This also adds complexity to application and protocol design, since protocols and applications perform a wide range of tasks for which they have not originally been designed. To overcome these problems, we add a new Context Aware Management (CAM) layer to the Internet Protocol stack. The purpose of CAM is to optimize the functionality of the node by monitoring the environment for changes and by adapting the behavior of the node accordingly. The protocols and applications thus perform the tasks for which they have been designed in the first place, and CAM makes the decisions regarding which protocols to use and with what parameters.</t>
