      <t>With the increasing interest to replace parts of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) with the IP-based network, the core functionality of PSTN such as emergency services, has to be offered when using IP-based technologies. Since the PSTN and the Internet follow different design principles their architecture is quite different. This fact has to be considered and security threats for an IP-based emergency environment have to be re-evaluated. This document investigates the potential threats against the IP based emergency architecture. It focuses on some analysis of threats for both the end hosts and the infrastructure that aims to support emergency services.</t>
