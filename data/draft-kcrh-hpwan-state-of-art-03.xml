    <abstract>
      <t>High Performance Wide Area Networks (HP-WANs) represent a critical infrastructure for the modern global Research and Education (R&amp;E) community, facilitating collaboration across national and international boundaries. These networks include global education and research networks, such as GÃ‰ANT, Internet2, Janet, ESnet, CANARIE, CERNET, and others, and also refer to large scale commercial dedicated networks built by hyperscalers and operators. They are designed to support the ever-growing transmission of vast amounts of data generated by scientific research, high-performance computing, distributed AI-training and large-scale simulations. This document provides an overview of the terminology and techniques used for existing HP-WANs. It also explores the technological advancements, operational tools, and future directions for HP-WANs, emphasising their role in enabling cutting-edge scientific research, AI training and massive R&amp;E data analysis.</t>
