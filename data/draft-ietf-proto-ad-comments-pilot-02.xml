      <t>This document describes a pilot implementation of a protocol change within the IETF. The essence of the change is to have workgroup chairs handle the feedback of AD (Area Director) Evaluation comments on a draft to the authors (and workgroup if necessary) and make sure that needed draft changes are made, and the AD notified when a new draft which resolves the comments is available.</t>
