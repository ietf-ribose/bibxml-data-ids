      <t>Dynamic Anycast (Dyncast) is a new routing approach to support equivalent services running in distributed geolocations and connect to them by considering both network-related metric and service- related metric. In LISP, it is possible to support anycast EIDs and/ or anycast RLOCs without any modification, so it is suitable for providing dyncast routing. In this document, it describes the LISP- based dyncast architecture and related standard works to meet dyncast requirements.</t>
