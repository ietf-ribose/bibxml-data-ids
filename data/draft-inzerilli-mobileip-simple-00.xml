      <t>In this document is proposed a protocol for intra-domain mobility management. This is intended to offer a transparent point-to-point transport service for IP datagrams that need to be delivered to mobile nodes. SIMPLE (Scalable Intra-domain Mobility Protocol using Local Encapsulation) makes it possible for a mobile node to change its point of attachment to a LAN, a group of LANs or even a MAN without changing its IP address, this link being the home or a foreign one.</t>
