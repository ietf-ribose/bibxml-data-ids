      <t>RFC 2724 presented an analysis and taxonomy of RTFM attributes, and proposed adding new attributes and new types of attribute. Many of those 'new' attributes, especially the distribution-valued attributes, have now had several years implementation experience. This document proposes that these attributes be implemented, i.e that the RTFM Architecture and Meter MIB RFCs be re-written to include them.</t>
