      <t>RFC 2724 presented an analysis and taxonomy of RTFM attributes, andproposed adding new attributes and new types of attribute. Many ofthose 'new' attributes, especially the distribution-valued attributes,have now had several years implementation experience. This documentproposes that these attributes be implemented, i.e that the RTFMArchitecture and Meter MIB RFCs be re-written to include them.</t>
