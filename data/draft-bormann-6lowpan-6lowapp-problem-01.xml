      <t>The 6LoWPAN and ROLL WGs are laying the groundwork to make theWireless Embedded Internet a reality, but what application protocolswill we use? Request-response protocols like HTTP are a poor fit toa communication model with battery-operated, mostly sleeping nodes.In addition, the usual data formats (both headers and body) areperceived to be too chatty for the 50-60 byte payloads possible inLoWPANs and to require too much code for the 8-bit and 16-bitprocessors dominating the Internet of Things. Still, it would be amistake to start a new silo of application protocols that do notbenefit from existing application area Internet experience.This document provides a problem statement for possible work on ofapplication protocols in 6LoWPAN networks or, more generally, in low-power, lossy networks, as well as some considerations for requiredrelated work.</t>
