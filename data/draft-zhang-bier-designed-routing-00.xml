      <t>BIER specifies a new architecture for the forwarding of multicast data packets. As the [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] said, in the BIER domain, it does not require a protocol for explicitly building multicast distributing trees, nor does it require intermediate nodes to maintain any per-flow state. In some deployments, some specific multicast flows may be forwarded by special routing; it cannot be achieved by the forwarding rule that is provided. In this document we will defined a new routing list in BIER header, the packets will be steered according to the routing list.</t>
