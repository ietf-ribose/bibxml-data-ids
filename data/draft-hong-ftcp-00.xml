      <t>The goal of this document is to propose an improvement of TCP congestion control algorithm based on a very simple idea. One specific goal of FTCP is to smooth TCP traffic in order to improve the throughput, reduce losses and delay variation. FTCP algorithm is fully TCP-compatible [RFC 2914].</t>
