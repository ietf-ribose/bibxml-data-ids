      <t>The term "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Trunk" has become almost commonplace amongst vendors and SIP providers. Even though the notion of a 'trunk' has a well defined meaning in circuit switched systems, it has never been defined for SIP. This document provides a formal definition for a SIP trunk, discusses its scope and applications, and establishes best practices for identification and security of SIP trunks.</t>
