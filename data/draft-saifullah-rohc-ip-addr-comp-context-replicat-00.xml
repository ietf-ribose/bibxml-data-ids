      <t>The Context Replication (CR) mechanism [3] for Robust HeaderCompression (ROHC) uses an existing compression context for creatinga new compression context, thus, saves sending some of the headerinformation from the compressor to the decompressor during contextinitialization. The current CR mechanism could also save sending anIP address from the header information. However, it either sends awhole IP address or doesn't send an IP address. This Internet Draftenhances the CR mechanism by providing an option of sendingcompressed IP address.</t>
