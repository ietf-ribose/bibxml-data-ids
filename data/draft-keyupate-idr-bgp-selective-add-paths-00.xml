      <t>Originally, a BGP speaker was only allowed to advertise one path to any given address prefix. If the BGP speaker advertised a second path to a given prefix, the second path was considered to be a replacement for the first. The BGP ADD-PATH capability was defined to enable a BGP speaker to advertise multiple paths to a given address prefix, without one path replacing any of the others. However, whether a BGP speaker advertises multiple paths for any given prefix is always a matter of local policy for that BGP speaker. In certain situations, it is desirable to allow a BGP speaker to signal to its peers that the peers may advertise multiple simultaneous paths for certain prefixes but not for others. This document defines a new BGP capability, the Selective ADD-PATH capability, that allows a BGP speaker to signal to its peers whether a particular prefix is or is not eligible to have multiple paths advertised.</t>
