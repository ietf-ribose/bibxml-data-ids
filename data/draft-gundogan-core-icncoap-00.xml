      <t>The information-centric networking (ICN) paradigm offers replication of autonomously verifiable content throughout a network, in which content is bound to names instead of hosts. This has proven beneficial in particular for the constrained IoT. Several approaches, the most prominent of which being Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) and Named-Data Networking (NDN), propose access to named content directly on the network layer. Independently, the CoRe WG developed mechanisms that support autonomous content processing, on-path caching, and content object security using CoAP proxies and OSCORE. This document describes a data-centric deployment option using standard CoAP features to replicate information-centric properties and benefits to the host-centric IoT world.</t>
