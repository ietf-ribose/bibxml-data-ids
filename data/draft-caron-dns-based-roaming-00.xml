      <t>To achieve global roaming, that is, allow any client of any service provider (the home network) to use the facilities of any other network provider (the foreign network), it is necessary to enable the foreign network to find AAA facilities able to handle requests for those users, based on the NAI provided. This document documents such a method, based on DNS.</t>
