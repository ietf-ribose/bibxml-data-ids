      <t>The use of directory services based on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [LDAP] is becoming increasingly popular for distributed and web-based services. Since most LDAP-based applications have developed their schemas independently, new application designers find themselves faced with the dilemma of how to interoperate with an already conflicting set of existing LDAP specifications. Today's Web-aware customers expect interoperability, so it is crucial to converge existing schema in a way that supports interoperability across arbitrary applications and vendors. In this spirit, we describe an LDAP schema for internet mail routing and delivery that is designed to be modular and to support a common core for sharing user state across an arbitrary set of applications.</t>
