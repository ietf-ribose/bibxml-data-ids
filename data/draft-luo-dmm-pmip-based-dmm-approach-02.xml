      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is standardized by IETF to supply mobility management for mobile nodes (MN). For supporting Distributed Mobility Management based on current PMIP standard, enhanced Proxy Mobile IPv6 (ePMIP) with two new logic functions is introduced. (1) Location Management Function (LMF), (2) Distributed Anchoring Function (DAF), including Distributed Routing sub-Function (DRF) and Distributed Mobility sub-Function (DMF). Basic signalling procedures and considerations are also described in this document.</t>
