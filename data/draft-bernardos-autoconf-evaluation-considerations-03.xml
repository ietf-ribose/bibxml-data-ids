      <t>This Internet Draft aims at providing general guidelines for theAUTOCONF solution space, through providing a set of evaluationconsiderations for IP autoconfiguration mechanisms in MANETs. Theseevaluation considerations conform to the AUTOCONF problem statementdraft and the MANET architecture draft. The main objective of thisdraft is to illustrate some key features and highlight some importantbehaviours for the different autoconf mechanisms, and thus aiming tohelp solution developers during mechanisms' design and to helpimplementers in the choice of the autoconf mechanism that fits bettertheir particular requirements, taking into consideration a number ofimportant factors that are discussed in this draft.</t>
