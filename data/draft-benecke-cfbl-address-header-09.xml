    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a method that allows a Message Originator to specify a complaint feedback loop (FBL) address as a message header field. Also, it defines the rules for processing and forwarding such a complaint. The motivation for this arises out of the absence of a standardized and automated way to provide Mailbox Providers with an address for a complaint feedback loop. Currently, providing and maintaining such an address is a manual and time-consuming process for Message Originators and Mailbox Providers. It is unclear, at the time of publication, whether the function provided by this document has widespread demand, and whether the mechanism offered will be adopted and found to be useful. Therefore, this is being published as an Experiment, looking for a constituency of implementers and deployers, and for feedback on the operational utility. The document is produced through the Independent RFC stream and was not subject to the IETF's approval process.</t>
