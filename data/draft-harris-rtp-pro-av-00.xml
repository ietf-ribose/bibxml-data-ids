      <t>This note discusses a proposed embedding for uncompressed video and audio within an RTP stream. Whilst this is not a finished document, and although it was not written with wider distribution in mind, I think it may be useful as a 'straw man' proposal to provoke further discussion of the use of RTP for professional media.</t>
