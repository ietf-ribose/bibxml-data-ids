      <t>This draft presents a policy-based Differentiated Services [DSARCH] architecture that has been realized on the AIX operating system. We briefly motivate the benefits of supporting DiffServ functions on servers using policy-based networking, and outline the requirements for DiffServ-enabled servers. We then describe the policy-based DiffServ infrastructure we have developed for AIX. Experimental results using Web server workloads demonstrate the efficacy of the DiffServ mechanisms provided. We also outline ongoing work in deploying diffserv-capable AIX servers on Internet2.</t>
