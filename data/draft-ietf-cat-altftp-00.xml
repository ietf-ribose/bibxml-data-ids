      <t>This document defines an extension to the FTP service whereby an FTP client may indicate an authentication mechanism to the server, perform an authentication protocol exchange, and optionally negotiate a protection mechanism for subsequent protocol interactions. This extension is a counterproposal to the extensions documented in the work-in-progress draft-ietf-cat-ftpsec-NN.txt and is offered to the IETF CAT working group for consideration as a replacement for that work-in-progress. The authentication and protection mechanisms used by this extension are those used by the IMAP4 protocol.</t>
