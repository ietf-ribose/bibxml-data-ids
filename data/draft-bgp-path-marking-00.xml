      <t>The potential advertisement of non-best paths by a BGP speaker supporting the add-path or the best-external extensions makes it difficult for other BGP speakers to identify the paths that have been selected as best by those who advertise them. This information is required for proper operation of some applications. Towards that end, this document proposes marking the paths using extended communities that encode the path type.</t>
