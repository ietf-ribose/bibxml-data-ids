      <t>The telephone number delegation and call routing system is ahierarchitecal system. ITU standard E.164 defines the structure of thetelephone number as follows:{country code) (Nationally significant part)The country code may be from one to three digits, and the total lengthmay be up to 16 digits. The nationally significant portion may bearbitraily divided on any number boundary. In many countries numeringplans, the divisions are not uniform, that is, the 'area codes' or'City codes' may be of varying lengths within a single country and thetotal number of digits may be variable.Within this flexiblity, it is always the case that the delegation ofauthority is done left-to-right. With this assumption, a numberingtree can be built on a digit-by-digit basis can represent any of thesehierarchical structures. DNS permits the delegation of authority onarbitary boundaries such that a delegation to country code '1', '44',and '972' can all coexist under a single numbering plan root. Thesame applies for 'area codes', 'City codes' or 'service selectors'within numbering plans.The protocol mechanics outlined in this document are devised in such amanner that the clients do not need any knowledge of the numberingplan itself to correctly construct a query of the Address ResolutionService. The client may mechanically collect digits, format thequery, and receive a response to any telephone number in the world.</t>
