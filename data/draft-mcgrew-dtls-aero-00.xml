      <t>Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is a communication security protocol that is attractive for use in constrained environments, in which it is important to minimize the data expansion added by the security protocol, and to support multicast security . Authenticated Encryption with Replay prOtection (AERO) is a cryptographic technique that is well suited for use in DTLS, especially in these scenarios: it has minimal data expansion, avoids the need to manage implicit state, works well with multiple receivers and multiple senders, and provides strong misuse resistance. This document describes how AERO can be used in DTLS.</t>
