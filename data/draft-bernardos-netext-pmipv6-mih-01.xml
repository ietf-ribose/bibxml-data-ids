      <t>The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). PMIPv6enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam acrossgateways without changing the IP address. PMIPv6 also provideslimited multi-homing support to multi-mode mobile devices.While the basic scenario addressed by PMIPv6 considers MNs with justone interface, PMIPv6 also allows an MN to connect to the same PMIPv6domain through different interfaces. This limited support of multi-interfaced MNs is not fully specified, since the MAG needs to obtain/guess additional information from the MN, in order to decide whetherto treat an MN's interface attachment as a handover or as newinterface attachment (i.e. meaning the creation of a new mobilitysession and, therefore, the allocation of new home network prefixesto the MN). The use of the Media Independent Handover (MIH) Servicesas defined in the IEEE 802.21-2008 specification [IEEE80221] may helpin obtaining this additional information. This I-D describes howPMIPv6 would work in an 802.21-enabled scenario, and in particular,analyzes how MIH primitives can be used to help the MAG deal withmulti-technology scenarios. The main objective of the IEEE 802.21-2008 standard is to provide link layer intelligence to upper layers.Hence, a more intelligent decision making capability leading to morereliable and efficient handovers between heterogeneous networks canbe enabled.</t>
