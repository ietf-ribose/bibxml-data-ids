      <t>The Network Basic I/O System (NetBIOS) NetBIOS was developed in the early 1980s to allow applications to communicate over a network. The TCP/IP version called NetBIOSoverTCP/IP(NetBT), was developed to support communications between symbolically named stations and transfer of arbitrary data.NetBT supports all three services (Name, Datagram and Session) supported by NetBIOS. The Server Message Block (SMB) is a presentation layer protocol providing file and print sharing functions for LAN Manager, and other network operating systems. SMB over NetBT session is not clearly explained in the RFCs [Netbios concepts] and [Netbios specification] and this document attempts to provide information on this. This document is intended for documentation purpose and for informational use only.This document does not attempt to define a standard, rather tries explaining an existing implementation. This document puts together pieces of information scattered in multiple documents and offers a single complete documentation for this specific application (smb over NetBT).</t>
