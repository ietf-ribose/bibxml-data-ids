      <t>This documents describes an architecture which can be used to extend MPLS networks to integrate access and aggregation networks into a single MPLS domain ("Seamless MPLS"). The Seamless MPLS approach is based on existing and well known protocols. It provides a highly flexible and a scalable architecture and the possibility to integrate 100.000 of nodes. The separation of the service and transport plane is one of the key elements; Seamless MPLS provides end to end service independent transport. Therefore it removes the need for service specific configurations in network transport nodes (without end to end transport MPLS, some additional services nodes/configurations would be required to glue each transport domain). This draft defines a routing architecture using existing standardized protocols. It does not invent any new protocols or defines extensions to existing protocols.</t>
