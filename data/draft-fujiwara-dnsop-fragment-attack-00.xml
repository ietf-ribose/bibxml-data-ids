      <t>Researchers proposed DNS cache poisoning attacks using IP fragmentation. This document shows feasible and adequate measures at full-service resolvers against these attacks. To protect resolvers from these attacks, avoid fragmentation (limit requestor's UDP payload size to 1220/1232), drop fragmented UDP DNS responses and use TCP at resolver side.</t>
