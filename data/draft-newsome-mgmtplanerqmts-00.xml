      <t>The objective of this draft is to discuss methods for deciding that an IP network would be improved in some way by the addition of extra capacity, (provided by an underlying network). The draft concludes that the only reasonable way of doing this is the result of co-operation between routers, and that this co-operation leads to the need for standardization of this process.</t>
