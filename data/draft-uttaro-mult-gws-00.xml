      <t>This document presents an application of the BGP community attribute in simplifying the implementation and configuration of routing policies between two or more VPN service providers. It is assumed that RFC2547 has been implemented to provide the VPN service although this is not a requirement of this application It shows how use of the community attribute along with the setting of a BGP metric can be used by customers to select the best gateway between one or more VPN service providers. This technique simplifies configuration and management at the provider level, and gives the customer the ability to control its own routing policy with respect to the selection of gateways between service providers.</t>
