      <t>As the DNS Security (DNSSEC) specifications have evolved, thesyntax and semantics of the DNSSEC resource records (RRs) havechanged. Many deployed nameservers understand variants of thesesemantics. Dangerous interactions can occur when a resolver thatunderstands an earlier version of these semantics queries anauthoritative server that understands the new delegation signersemantics, including at least one failure scenario that will causean unsecured zone to be unresolvable. This document proposes thatthese interactions be avoided by changing the type codes andmnemonics of the DNSSEC RRs (SIG, KEY, and NXT).</t>
