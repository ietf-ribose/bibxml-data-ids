      <t>The Universal Forms Description Language (UFDL) describes complex business forms for use over the Internet. The objective of the UFDL is to enable the creation of cross-platform Internet business forms that (1) contain both the complex logic and precise layout that administrators require, (2) are simple to maintain and distribute, and (3) integrate easily with existing business systems. As more and more business is done over the Internet, the need for a form description language that incorporates these features grows. HTML is designed for Internet pages, and is severely limited as a form language. This document specifies the vocabulary, syntax, and meaning of the UFDL.</t>
