      <t>The objective of Energy Management (EMAN)is to provide an energy management framework for networked devices. This document presents the applicability of the EMAN framework for a variety of scenarios. This document lists use cases and target devices that can potentially implement the EMAN framework and associated SNMP MIB modules. These use cases are useful for identifying monitoring requirements that need to be considered. Further, we describe the relationship of the EMAN framework to relevant other energy monitoring standards and architectures.</t>
