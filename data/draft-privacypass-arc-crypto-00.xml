      <t>This document specifies the Anonymous Rate-Limited Credential (ARC) protocol, a specialization of keyed-verification anonymous credentials with support for rate limiting. ARC credentials can be presented from client to server up to some fixed number of times, where each presentation is cryptographically bound to client secrets and application-specific public information, such that each presentation is unlinkable from the others as well as the original credential creation. ARC is useful in applications where a server needs to throttle or rate-limit access from anonymous clients.</t>
