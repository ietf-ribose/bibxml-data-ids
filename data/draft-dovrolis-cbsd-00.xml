      <t>This document describes the Class-Based Service Differentiation (CBSD)architecture and it proposes a set of Per-Hop-Behaviors that can be usedfor implementing it. According to CBSD, the network traffic is mapped toa set of classes. The differentiating factor between traffic classes isthe relative forwarding quality in a DS capable router. The Class PHBshave quite similar semantics with the Precedence PHBs, recently proposedby Baker et.al. in [PREC], but an attempt is made here to define them in amore general manner, decoupling them from specific implementationpossibilities. There is also a semantical overlap between the ExpeditedForwarding PHB of [DSFIELD] and the highest Class PHB. Consequently, theDiffserv working group may want to combine these three PHB proposals in asingle one, minimizing the number of DS Field bits used.</t>
