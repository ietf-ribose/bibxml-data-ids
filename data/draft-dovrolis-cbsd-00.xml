      <t>This document describes the Class-Based Service Differentiation (CBSD) architecture and it proposes a set of Per-Hop-Behaviors that can be used for implementing it. According to CBSD, the network traffic is mapped to a set of classes. The differentiating factor between traffic classes is the relative forwarding quality in a DS capable router. The Class PHBs have quite similar semantics with the Precedence PHBs, recently proposed by Baker et.al. in [PREC], but an attempt is made here to define them in a more general manner, decoupling them from specific implementation possibilities. There is also a semantical overlap between the Expedited Forwarding PHB of [DSFIELD] and the highest Class PHB. Consequently, the Diffserv working group may want to combine these three PHB proposals in a single one, minimizing the number of DS Field bits used.</t>
