    <abstract>
      <t>A patent-pending method of encoding binary data for transfer between computers connected via a network, in which the encoded data optimally has an expansion ratio of about 1.22 (22%). Generally, the method relates to transfering binary data over the network using 94 ASCII printable characters by fast encoding. Specifically, the method includes breaking the data into a plurality of chunks, and substantially performing some MOD and INT operations on these chunks according to predefined combinatorial conditions. NOTE: This RFC includes Background, Summary, and Detailed Description Sections - for those wanting to understand the method; and a Working Prototype (section 2.0) - for those wanting to quickly implement and measure the qualities of improvement described; specifically as 'C-LANGUAGE IMPLEMENTATION DEMO' (section 5.0).</t>
