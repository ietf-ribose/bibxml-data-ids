      <t>This document provides an overview of the draft requirements for IPv6support in the CableLabs DOCSIS 3.0 specifications. Our goal is toshare high-level IPv6 requirements and design architecture in draftstatus with the IETF community.We first introduce the main network elements involved in the supportof IPv6 in DOCSIS cable networks and expand on the deploymentscenarios in scope of the DOCSIS 3.0 efforts. We elaborate on theroles played by some network elements in enabling IPv6 in DOCSIS: thebroadband access device (Cable Modem), the headend or network sideequipment (Cable Modem Termination System) and the various backofficeservers. Some high-level requirements are then summarized with aspecial focus on three network services: IPv6 provisioning andmanagement of cable modems, IPv6 transport via a DOCSIS network usinga cable modem acting as an IPv6 bridge or router, and IP multicast.Finally, we conclude with a theory of operations section to providemore details and sample flows on how an IPv6-capable cable modemacquires its IPv6 address and configuration parameters over a DOCSIS3.0 network.CableLabs, its members, the vendors participating in the DOCSISspecifications and the co-authors of this document are seekinggeneral feedback from the IETF community on the overall DOCSIS IPv6approach. The level of requirements provided in this document mayvary; we also welcome feedback on where more details should beprovided in future versions.</t>
