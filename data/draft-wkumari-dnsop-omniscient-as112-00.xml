      <t>The AS112 Project loosely coordinates Domain Name System (DNS) servers to which DNS zones corresponding to private use addresses are delegated. Queries for names within those zones have no useful responses in a global context. The purpose of the project is to reduce the load of such junk queries on the authoritative name servers that would otherwise receive them, directing the load instead to name servers operated within the AS112 project. Adding and dropping zones from the AS112 servers is difficult, due to the loosely-coordinated nature of the project. This document proposes a mechanism by which AS112 name servers could answer authoritatively for all possible zones, reducing the add/drop problem to one of delegation within the DNS without operational impact on the servers themselves. This document updates RFC 6304.</t>
