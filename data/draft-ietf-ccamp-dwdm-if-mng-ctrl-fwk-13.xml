      <t>The control and management of DWDM interfaces are a precondition for enhanced multilayer networking. They are needed to ensure an efficient data transport, to meet the requirements requested by today's IP-services and to provide a further automation of network provisioning and operations. This document describes use cases, requirements and solutions for the control and management of optical interface parameters according to different types of single channel DWDM interfaces. The focus is on automating the network provisioning process irrespective on how it is triggered i.e. by Element Manager System (EMS), Network Management System (NMS) or Generalized Multi Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS). This document covers management and control considerations in different scenarios of single channel DWDM interfaces. The purpose is to identify the necessary information and processes to be used by control or management systems to properly and efficiently drive the network.</t>
