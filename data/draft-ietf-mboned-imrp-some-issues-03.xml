      <t>The IETF's Inter-Domain Multicast Routing (IDMR) working group has produced several multicast routing protocols, including Core Based Trees [CBT] and Protocol Independent Multicasting [PIMARCH]. In addition, the IDMR WG has formalized the specification of the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol [DVMRP]. Various specifications for protocol inter-operation have also been produced (see, for example, [THALER96] and [PIMMBR]). However, none of these protocols seems ideally suited to the inter-domain routing case; that is, while these protocols are appropriate for the intra-domain routing environment, they break down in various ways when applied in to the multi-provider inter-domain case. This document considers some of the scaling, stability and policy issues that are of primary importance in a inter-domain, multi- provider multicast environment.</t>
