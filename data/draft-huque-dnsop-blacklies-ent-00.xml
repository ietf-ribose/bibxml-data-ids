      <t>The Black Lies method of providing compact DNSSEC denial of existence proofs has some operational implications. Depending on the specific implementation, it may provide no way to reliably distinguish Empty Non-Terminal names from names that actually do not exist. This draft describes the use of a synthetic DNS resource record type to act as an explicit signal for Empty Non-Terminal names and which is conveyed in an NSEC type bitmap.</t>
