      <t>The NetLMM WG has specified the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) for network-based localized mobility management, taking basic support for registration, de-registration and handover of Mobile Node (MN) into account in the RFC 5213 [1]. However, when a MN configures with multiple interfaces, the corresponding supporting scheme is needed. This document proposes an easy extension of the basic PMIPv6 protocol with the address option. Then the MN can communicate with CN using anyone interface but always maintain the upper layer application with a fixed home address (HoA). Besides, the operation and extension is transparent to the MAG and compatible with the other specifications.</t>
