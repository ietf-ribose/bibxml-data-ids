      <t>Distributed multimedia applications require performance guarantees from the underlying network subsystem. Ethernet has been the dominant local area network architecture in the last decade, and we believe that it will remain popular because of its cost-effectiveness and the availability of higher-bandwidth Ethernets. We present the design of a software-based timed-token protocol called RETHER that provides real-time performance guarantees to multimedia applications without requiring any modifications to existing Ethernet hardware. RETHER features a hybrid mode of operation to reduce the performance impact on non-real-time network traffic, a race-condition-free distributed admission control mechanism, and an efficient token-passing scheme that protects the network against token loss due to node failures or otherwise. Performance measurements from a prototype running on 10-Mbps Ethernet and 100-Mbps Fast-Ethernet indicate that up to 60 of the raw bandwidth can be reserved without deteriorating the performance of non-real-time traffic significantly. This scheme is consistent with the ISSLL over LANs framework described in [7].</t>
