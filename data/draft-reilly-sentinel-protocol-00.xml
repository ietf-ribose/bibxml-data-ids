    <abstract>
      <t>The Reilly Sentinel Protocol (RSP) specifies an interoperable, dual-layer method for establishing integrity, provenance, and auditability across the artificial intelligence (AI) lifecycle. RSP defines a Sentinel Evidence Package (SEP) that binds payload digests, provenance metadata, signatures, blockchain timestamp proofs, and resolvable identifiers (DOIs). This enables tamper-evident, independently verifiable receipts for datasets, data transformations, training jobs, checkpoints, fine-tuning runs, evaluations, and inference outputs. RSP is transport-agnostic and serializable in JSON and CBOR. It leverages existing IETF and industry building blocks, including COSE/CMS signatures, CBOR (RFC 8949), CDDL (RFC 8610), JSON (RFC 8259), and NTS-secured time (RFC 8915). Anchoring is done via append-only blockchain receipts (e.g., OpenTimestamps-style proofs) and identity/lineage is stabilized with a DOI registry. The result is an evidence-grade audit trail for regulated and safety-critical AI deployments.</t>
