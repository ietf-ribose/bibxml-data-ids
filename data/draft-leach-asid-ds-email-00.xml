      <t>The LDAPv3 protocol (as specified in [1]) is designed to be a lightweight access protocol for directory services supporting X.500 models. In addition, in an Internet context, many of the names about which users seek information are Internet email addresses. A native LDAP based directory service for the Internet should make it convenient to process such names -- there is a huge social investment spanning two decades to get to the point where names like 'john.doe@somewhere.com' can appear in newspaper articles, TV commercials, and on billboards and millions of people understand what do with them. This draft defines a very simple convention for looking up information associated with people identified by Internet email addresses - really nothing more than identifying an existing capability of LDAP, in the hopes that the convention can become widespread.</t>
