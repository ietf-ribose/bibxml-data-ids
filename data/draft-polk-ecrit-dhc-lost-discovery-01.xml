      <t>The Location-to-Service Translation Protocol (LoST) describes an XML-based protocol for mapping service identifiers and geospatial orcivic location information to service contact Uniform ResourceLocators (URLs). LoST servers can be located anywhere but aplacement closer to the end host, e.g., in the access network, isdesireable. Such a LoST server placement provides benefits indisaster situations with intermittent network connectivity regardingthe resiliency of emergency service communication.This document describes how a LoST client can discover a LoST serverusing the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).</t>
