      <t>This document addresses control plane architecutre in GMPLS enabled IP- Optical networks. Two different control plane architectures are consid- ered: symmetical and asymmetrical control plane architectures. Addressing (router-ID, control plane address, and TE link address) and RSVP message handling (routing, HOP and ERO objects processing) are discussed for both architectures.The document also recommends normal practises for identification of TE links. Interwork between symmetrical and asymmetrical control plane is addressed.</t>
