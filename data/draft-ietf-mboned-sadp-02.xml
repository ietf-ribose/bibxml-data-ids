      <t>This document defines an application-layer protocol, the ScopedAddress Discovery Protocol (SADP), for discovering the scopedmulticast address(es) associated with a session at particular scopeswithin a hierarchically nested set of multicast scopes. SADP isdesigned to work within the context of Multicast Address AllocationArchitecture [MAAA]. It is intended that SADP will provide thenecessary general services for reliable multicast and searchingapplications to use expanding-scope searches in lieu of the wellknown, but less efficient expanding-ring search.</t>
