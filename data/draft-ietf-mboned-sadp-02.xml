      <t>This document defines an application-layer protocol, the Scoped Address Discovery Protocol (SADP), for discovering the scoped multicast address(es) associated with a session at particular scopes within a hierarchically nested set of multicast scopes. SADP is designed to work within the context of Multicast Address Allocation Architecture [MAAA]. It is intended that SADP will provide the necessary general services for reliable multicast and searching applications to use expanding-scope searches in lieu of the well known, but less efficient expanding-ring search.</t>
