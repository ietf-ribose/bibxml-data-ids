      <t>This document describes the reservation of Autonomous System numbers (ASNs) that may be used within networks but should not be advertised to the Internet, known as private use ASNs. This document enlarges the total space available for private use ASNs by documenting the reservation of a second larger range and updates RFC 1930.</t>
