      <t>This memo supports the process of progressing performance metric RFCsalong the standards track. Observing that the metric definitionsthemselves should be the primary focus rather than theimplementations of metrics, this memo describes results of examplelab test procedures to evaluate specific metric RFC requirementclauses to determine if the requirement has been implemented asintended.
