      <t>This memo supports the process of progressing performance metric RFCs along the standards track. Observing that the metric definitions themselves should be the primary focus rather than the implementations of metrics, this memo describes results of example lab test procedures to evaluate specific metric RFC requirement clauses to determine if the requirement has been implemented as intended. A single implementation has been tested against the key specifications of RFC 2679 on One-way Delay.</t>
