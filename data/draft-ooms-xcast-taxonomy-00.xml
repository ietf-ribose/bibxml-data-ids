      <t>Recently several multicast mechanisms were proposed that scale better with the number of multicast sessions than traditional multicast does (DCM [BLAZ], SGM [BOIV], Somecast [HELD], MDO6 [IMAI], CLM [OOMS], ERM [SHAN], REUNITE [STOI]). These proposals are also known as Explict Multicast (xcast; explicit list of destinations) or Small Group Multicast (sgm; the main application being few-to-few communication). To stimulate and streamline the discussion this draft is an attempt to make a taxonomy of these mechanisms.</t>
