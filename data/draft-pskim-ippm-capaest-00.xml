    <abstract>
      <t>In this draft, a mechanism for available capacity estimation of an end-to-end path is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy compared with the existing IGI(Initial Gap Increasing)/PTR(Packet Transmission Rate) mechanism. The proposed mechanism defines three cases of the difference between the average output gap and the input gap, and then reflects fully them, while the existing mechanism reflected only two cases. Since three cases are handled respectively by appropriate corresponding manners, the proposed mechanism can be expected to reduce the detection error for the turning point. Therefore, the end-to-end available capacity can be estimated more accurate than the existing mechanism.</t>
