      <t>This document serves as a primer for technical professionals involved in managing personal data, including biometric information from audio and video recordings, and other sensitive information in messaging or personal communications. It outlines key concepts in data privacy and communications privacy, addressing the ethical and legal considerations surrounding the collection, processing, and disclosure of consumer data. The document covers fundamental privacy principles, defines important roles in data processing, and explains consumer rights regarding their personal information. It also discusses the scope of protected personal information, including sensitive data categories, and explores techniques like data aggregation and anonymization. While referencing existing IETF work on privacy in Internet communications, this draft extends beyond to address consumer data privacy in relation to organizations handling such data. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of privacy considerations, aligning with fair information practices and current regulatory frameworks, to guide professionals in implementing privacy-respecting data management practices.</t>
