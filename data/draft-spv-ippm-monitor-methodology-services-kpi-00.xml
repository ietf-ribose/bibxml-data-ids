    <abstract>
      <t>We are introducing a new method to calculate services KPIs and metrics in the network using TWAMP protocol. The services here ranging from subscriber aware services to security application, Traffic load balancing, content delivery, real time streaming and like.The KPIs discussed in this draft include Service Latency, Serviced Packets Count, Serviced Subscriber Count, Application Liveliness and Session load per Service. KPIs monitoring of these services therefore, play a vital role in optimum usage of network resources such as capacity and throughput. Once we have the attributes like service latency, the network topology can be chosen to provide better quality of experience to the end user. For different services, the attributes may vary and our design takes care of supporting different KPIs for different services model. Additionally, liveliness of application and servers can be monitored using this proposed solution.</t>
