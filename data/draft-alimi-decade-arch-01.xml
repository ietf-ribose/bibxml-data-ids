      <t>Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have become widely used on the Internet today and make up a large portion of the traffic in many networks. One technique to improve the network efficiency of P2P applications is to introduce storage capabilities within the network. The DECADE Working Group has been formed with the goal of developing an architecture to provide this capability. This document presents an architecture, discusses the underlying principles and identifies core components and protocols supporting the architecture.</t>
