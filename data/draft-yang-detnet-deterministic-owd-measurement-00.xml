      <t>One-way delay is a key indicator to measure network quality. Some applications are one-way transmission in the network, such as some high-definition video services, and are very sensitive to one-way delay. Excessive delay will affect user experience greatly. To some extent, the network can't even be used, so it is very important to accurately measure the network transmission delay. The current one- way delay measurement method has problems such as high complexity and low measurement accuracy. In order to solve the problem of high- precision one-way delay measurement, a one-way delay measurement method based on deterministic networking is proposed in this document. The method takes advantage of the delay characteristics of the deterministic networking and does not depend on precise time synchronization.The method realizes the one-way delay measurement of any service flow between any network elements. Its technical advantages are: the network does not need to send measurement packets, can test all traffic types, does not change network status, does not change the format of traffic packets, and does not require network elements to support time synchronization protocols.</t>
