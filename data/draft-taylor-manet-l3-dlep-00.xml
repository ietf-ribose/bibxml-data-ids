    <abstract>
      <t>There exists a class of devices where DLEP functionality is desired but as the devices operate at layer-3, supporting the core DLEP specification with its requirement that modems operate as transparent layer-2 bridges is inappropriate. This document introduces two optional extensions to the core DLEP specification. Each extension may be used in isolation without breaking backwards compatibility. By relaxing the requirement that all DLEP destinations be identified by MAC address, and the addition of a new extension TLV describing available destination routes, the functionality of DLEP can be implemented by layer-3 forwarding devices. Note: o This document is intended as an extension to the core DLEP specification, and readers are expected to be fully conversant with the operation of core DLEP. o The DLEP specification is still in draft, and this document serves a secondary purpose to explore and validate the extension mechanisms detailed in DLEP. This document will therefore require further update as the core DLEP draft progresses towards standards track.</t>
