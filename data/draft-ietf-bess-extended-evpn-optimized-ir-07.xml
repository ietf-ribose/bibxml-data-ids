    <abstract>
      <t>In the Virtualization Overlay (NVO) network with Ethernet VPN (EVPN), optimized ingress replication uses Assisted-Replication (AR) to achieve more efficient delivery of Broadcast and Multicast (BM) traffic. An AR-LEAF, which is a Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) device, forwards received BM traffic from its tenant system to an AR- REPLICATOR. The AR-REPLICATOR then replicates it to the remaining AR-LEAFs in the network. However, when replicating the packet on behalf of its multihomed AR-LEAF, an AR-REPLICATOR may face challenges in retaining the source IP address or including the expected Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) label that is required for EVPN split-horizon filtering. This document extends the optimized ingress replication procedures to address such limitations. The extended procedures specified in this document allow the support of EVPN multihoming on the AR-LEAFs as well as optimized ingress replication for the rest of the EVPN NVO network.</t>
