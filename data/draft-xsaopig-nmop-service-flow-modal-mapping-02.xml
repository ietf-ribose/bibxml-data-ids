      <t>This Internet-Draft specifies a comprehensive framework for mapping service flow characteristics to network modal resources in multi- modal intelligent computing networks. It introduces the use of the ALTO protocol for collecting service flow data and leverages an SDN architecture to separate control and data planes. The ALTO protocol facilitates the acquisition of diverse network state information, including data from several SDN domains and dynamic network environments, directly from controllers while keeping the provider's internal details confidential. It then transmits the controller's decisions using a proven method. The document details methods for characteristic identification, intelligent mapping, and continuous optimization, enabling dynamic resource allocation and improved network performance. The framework is designed to support scalable, efficient, and secure operations in environments with complex network loads and diverse service requirements.</t>
