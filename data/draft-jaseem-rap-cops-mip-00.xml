      <t>Mobile IP is a protocol that is used to achieve transparent routing of IP packets to a mobile node. A mobile node obtains a care-of-address in the foreign network and registers that address with the home agent. The home agent as well as the foreign agent can apply policies to the mobile node registration. This draft defines COPS [1] usage for Mobile IPv4 [2]. It describes how COPS is used to control Mobile IP registration based on policies. It defines the interactions between the PEP and the PDP to handle Mobile IP registration messages. It also provides a guideline for mobility agents on how to use this COPS client with regards to the registration messages.</t>
