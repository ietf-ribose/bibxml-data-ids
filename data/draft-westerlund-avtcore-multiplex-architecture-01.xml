      <t>Real-time Transport Protocol is a flexible protocol possible to use in a wide range of applications and network and system topologies. This flexibility and the implications of different choices should be understood by any application developer using RTP. To facilitate that understanding, this document contains an in-depth discussion of the usage of RTP's multiplexing points; the RTP session, the Synchronization Source Identifier (SSRC), and the payload type. The focus is put on the first two, trying to give guidance and source material for an analysis on the most suitable choices for the application being designed.</t>
