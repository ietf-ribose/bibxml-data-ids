      <t>The use of mail enabled applications such as calendaring and scheduling has grown considerably in the last decade. Enterprise and inter-enterprise business has become dependent on rapid scheduling of events and actions using this information technology. The store-and-forward characteristic of electronic messaging technologies has been shown to be complementary to the asynchronous nature of group communications. However, the longer term growth of mail enabled applications, such as calendaring and scheduling, is currently limited by the lack of Internet standards for the message content types that these groupware applications are based on. This specification is intended to progress the level of interoperability possible between dissimilar calendaring and scheduling applications that communicate using an SMTP or MIME transport. This specification defines a usage profile for the MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type [MIME-CAL]. Any MIME based calendaring and scheduling application that supports this MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type profile will be able to interoperate with other MIME based calendaring and scheduling applications using a broad range of scheduling functions.</t>
