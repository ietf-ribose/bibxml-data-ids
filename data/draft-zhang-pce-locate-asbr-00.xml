      <t>The ability to compute constrained shortest Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement. This document specifies a procedure for an inter-AS PCE to locate boundary node within its domain dynamically, which is used for path computation.</t>
