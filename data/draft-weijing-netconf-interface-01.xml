      <t>This document specifies an XML network management interface between a network managing system and a network managed system. The XML network management interface is intended for use in diverse network environments where transport, data and operating model requirements vary greatly. It is unlikely that a single transport, data and operating model specification will meet the needs of all anticipated service operators. Therefore, the XML network management interface is partitioned into layered components.</t>
