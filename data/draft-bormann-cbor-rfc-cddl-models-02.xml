    <abstract>
      <t>A number of CBOR- and JSON-based protocols have been defined before CDDL was standardized or widely used. This short draft records some CDDL definitions for such protocols, which could become part of a library of CDDL definitions available for use in CDDL2 processors. It focuses on CDDL in (almost) published IETF RFCs.</t>
