    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a fast mechanism for protecting pseudowires against egress endpoint failures, including egress attachment circuit failure, egress PE failure, multi-segment PW terminating PE failure, and multi-segment PW switching PE failure. Designed on the basis of multi-homed CE, PW redundancy, upstream label assignment and context specific label switching, the mechanism enables local repair to be performed by the router upstream adjacent to a failure. In particular, the router can restore PW traffic in the order of tens of milliseconds, by transmitting the traffic to a protector through a pre-established bypass tunnel. Therefore, the mechanism can reduce traffic loss before global repair reacts to the failure and the network converges on the topology changes due to the failure.</t>
