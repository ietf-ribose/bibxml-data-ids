    <abstract>
      <t>In certain networking topologies it may be advantageous to maintain associations between endpoints and key transit points to support an instance of a service. Such associations are known as Calls. A Call does not provide the actual connectivity for transmitting user traffic, but only builds a relationship by which subsequent connections may be made. In Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) such connections are known as Label Switched Paths (LSPs). This document specifies how GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling may be used and extended to support Calls. These mechanisms provide full and logical Call/Connection separation. The mechanisms proposed in this document are applicable to any environment (including multi-area), and for any type of interface: packet, layer-2, time-division multiplexed, lambda or fiber switching.</t>
