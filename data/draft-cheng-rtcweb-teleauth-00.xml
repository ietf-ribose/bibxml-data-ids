      <t>The WebRTC use-cases and related requirements are defined in [draft-ietf-rtcweb-use-cases-and-requirements] that contains browser to browser use-cases and browser-GW/server use-cases (e.g., telephony terminal). In the use-case of telephony terminal, it is necessary for telephony terminal to be able to attest his identity to the telephony operator. Unlike the current authentication specified in [draft-ietf-rtcweb-security] such as PKI based authentication and web based peer authentication WebRTC communication is directly controlled by the telephony operator, which poses new authentication methods, including re-using existence authentication mechanism of telephony operator and authentication by using web credentials. This document presents the security authentication of WebRTC communication for telephony terminal.</t>
