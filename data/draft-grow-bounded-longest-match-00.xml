      <t>Some ASes currently use length-based filters to manage the size ofthe routing table they use and propagate. This draft explores analternative to length-based filters which allows for more automaticconfiguration and which provides for better redundancy.Rather than use a filter, this draft proposes a method of modifyingthe BGP longest match algorithm by setting a bound on the prefixlengths eligible for preference. A bound would operate on longprefixes when covering route announcements are available; in certaincircumstances it would cause a router to prefer an aggregate over amore specific route announcement.</t>
