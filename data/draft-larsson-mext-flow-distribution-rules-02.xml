      <t>This document defines an OS independent rule language as a mean todefine and perform per flow path selection for a multi-homed node.Per flow path selection is typically needed when there exist multiplenetwork interfaces, each with different network characteristics, andan application has specific performance requirements for a data flowthat makes one network interface more suitable than another.The flow distribution rule set is used by the node itself but alsoexchanged with other nodes that needs to know about the multi-homednode's capability of receiving data on multiple network interfaces.This document does not define how the rule set is transferred betweennodes.</t>
