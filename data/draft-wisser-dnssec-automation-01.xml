      <t>This document describes an algorithm and a protocol to automate DNSSEC multi-signer [RFC8901] "Multi-Signer DNSSEC Models" setup, operations and decomissioning. It primarily deals with Model 2 of the Multi-Signer specification, where each operator has their own distinct KSK and ZSK sets (or CSK sets). It makes use of [RFC8078] "Managing DS Records from the Parent via CDS/CDNSKEY" and [RFC7477] "Child-to-Parent Synchronization in DNS" to accomplish this.</t>
