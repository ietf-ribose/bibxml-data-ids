      <t>The Key Negotiation Protocol enables an untrusting RADIUS client and RADIUS server to derive a key by reference to a mutually trusted actor called the Introducer. This key may subsequently be used for one of two purposes. First, it can credential a TLS PSK ciphersuite applied to a RadSec connection between the RADIUS client and RADIUS server; or secondly, to establish a trust relationship between the RADIUS client and a second Introducer that is trusted by the first Introducer. The composition of these capabilities enables a RADIUS client to establish a RadSec connection with any RADIUS server with whom it shares a direct or indirect trust relationship via one or more Introducers.</t>
