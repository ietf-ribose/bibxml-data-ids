      <t>This document describes updated processes for defining and implementing policies regarding the RFC Series as a whole and thus specifies version 3 of RFC Editor Model. The model defines two high- level tasks related to the RFC Series. Policy definition is the responsibility of the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), which produces policy proposals that are subject to approval by the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB). Policy implementation is primarily the responsibility of the RFC Production Center (RPC), under the ultimate authority of the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (IETF LLC). This document obsoletes RFC 8728. This document updates RFC 7841, RFC 8729, and RFC 8730.</t>
