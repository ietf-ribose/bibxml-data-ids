      <t>This document proposes changes to IKEv2 [IKEv2] to allow configuration data to be securely distributed to IPsec Remote Access Clients (IRACs) by IPsec Remote Access Servers (IRASs). It is assumed this draft will be merged with the IKEv2 draft [IKEv2] and refers to sections in that draft, preceded by '****'. This draft, on its own, is not intended to progress to any RFC status. Comments regarding this draft should be sent to ddukes@cisco.com or ipsec@lists.tislabs.com</t>
