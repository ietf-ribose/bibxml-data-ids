      <t>The document specifies a new BGP NLRI and SAFI for advertising WAN ports properties of a SDWAN edge node. SDWAN edge node's WAN ports may face untrusted networks, such as the public internet, may get assigned IP addresses from the Internet Service Providers (ISPs), may get assigned dynamic IP addresses via DHCP, or may have private addresses (e.g. inside third party Cloud DCs). Packets forwarded through those SDWAN WAN ports might need to be encrypted (depending on the user policies) or need to go through NAT. SDWAN edge nodes need to propagate those WAN ports properties to the peers who are authorized to communicate across different types of underlay networks including the untrusted networks. BGP Route Reflectors (RR) are proposed as the entities to propagate the WAN ports properties of SDWAN edge nodes to a controlled group of edges reachable via overlay networks.</t>
