      <t>If internet telephony networks based on peer-to-peer and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) technology are to become as viable as existing centralized telephony services, the peer-to-peer SIP technology must offer all the features of existing technologies. This draft lists some features which are in some way "challenging" for peer-to-peer SIP to support, and proposes a structure for the resulting protocol suite.</t>
