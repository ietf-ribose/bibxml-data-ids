      <t>The contents of this Internet Draft is a reprint of the body of thearchitecture document (DTS 02003 v0.10.8) of the TIPHON project.This document describes a functional architecture for the purposesof defining a voice over IP architecture that can interwork with theexisting Switched Circuit Networks (SCN).The full document is publicly available and can be found athttp://docbox.etsi.org/Tech-Org/TIPHON/Document/tiphon/07-drafts/wg2/DTS02003/ the current version is 0.10.8. Later versionswill appear in the same directory. This full document describesprotocol independent information flows and state diagrams on all thereference points.The next step in the TIPHON process will be the mapping of thereference points as defined in this document to existing standards.Since TIPHON does not intend to duplicate work so the project wouldappreciate assistance from IETF experts in the mapping of itsinformation flows to the appropriate IETF protocols. Candidateprotocols for the implementation of this architecture are SIP,MEGACOp and possibly others.</t>
