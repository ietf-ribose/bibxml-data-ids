      <t>This document defines a DTLS tunneling protocol for use in multimedia conferences that enables a Media Distribution Device (MDD) to facilitate key exchange between an endpoint in a conference and the Key Management Function (KMF) responsible for key distribution. The protocol is designed to ensure that the key material used for hop-by- hop encryption and authentication is accessible to the MDD, while the key material used for end-to-end encryption and authentication is inaccessible to the MDD.</t>
