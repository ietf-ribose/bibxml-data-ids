      <t>DNS cookies are a lightweight DNS transaction security mechanism designed for incremental deployment. They provide limited protection to DNS servers and resolvers against a variety of increasingly common denial-of-service and amplification/forgery or cache poisoning attacks by off-path attackers. DNS Cookies are tolerant of NAT, NAT- PT, and anycast.</t>
