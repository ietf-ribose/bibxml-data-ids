      <t>This Internet Draft provides a detailed description of most of theexisting IP autoconfiguration solutions proposed so far. The mainaim of this document is to serve as a general reference for theAUTOCONF solution space. We present most of the previously proposedIP AUTOCONF mechanisms in MANETs, showing their key characteristics.Furthermore, each solution is analysed based on a number ofevaluation considerations.</t>
