      <t>This Internet Draft provides a detailed description of most of the existing IP autoconfiguration solutions proposed so far. The main aim of this document is to serve as a general reference for the AUTOCONF solution space. We present most of the previously proposed IP AUTOCONF mechanisms in MANETs, showing their key characteristics. Furthermore, each solution is analysed based on a number of evaluation considerations.</t>
