      <t>This document proposes a simplified key exchange protocol for the establishment of a symmetric key shared between two devices or entities within a constrained environment. The pair-wise key establishment is performed using the mediation of a trusted Simple Key Distribution Center (SKDC) entity. The protocol also supports the mediated distribution of a group-key among multiple devices or entities for the purposes of protecting multicast messages.</t>
