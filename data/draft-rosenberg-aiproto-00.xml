      <t>This document defines a protocol that facilitates integration of tools into the design and run-time operations of AI Agents. The focus is on enterprise AI agents that need to make use of APIs exposed by third party providers. This protocol, called the Normalized API for AI Agents Calling Tools (N-ACT) - pronounced like "enact" - defines an OpenAI spec that has two principle features - enumeration of tools and invocation of tools. The enumeration API enables a human - the AI Agent designer employed by the enterprise - to select and include tools from third-party vendors into operating procedures (also known as skills or instructions) which direct the behavior of AI Agents, including how and when to invoke those tools. The enumeration API can also be used (optionally) at run-time for the LLM to obtain tool descriptions. The second feature of the API - invocation - allows the AI Agent executor to perform the inter-domain invocation of the tool at run time. By standardizing these two API functions, the time and cost of integration of Internet APIs into AI Agents can be reduced.</t>
