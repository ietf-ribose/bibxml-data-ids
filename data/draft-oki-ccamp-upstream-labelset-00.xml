      <t>This document describes extensions to GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling requiredto support a upstream label set when a bidirectional path is set up. Inthe existing drafts on GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling, a upstream label for theupstream path has to be reserved at an intermediate node before Pathmessage is transmitted to the next-hop node. On the other hand, a labelset that includes one or more labels for the downstream path is carriedby Path message and then Resv message reserves a label at each interme-diate node on the route or a source node. This document proposes theway to support the upstream label set as is the case of the Label Setfor downstream.</t>
