      <t>This document describes extensions to GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling required to support a upstream label set when a bidirectional path is set up. In the existing drafts on GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling, a upstream label for the upstream path has to be reserved at an intermediate node before Path message is transmitted to the next-hop node. On the other hand, a label set that includes one or more labels for the downstream path is carried by Path message and then Resv message reserves a label at each interme- diate node on the route or a source node. This document proposes the way to support the upstream label set as is the case of the Label Set for downstream.</t>
