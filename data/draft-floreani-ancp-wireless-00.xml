      <t>The Access Node Control Protocol (ANCP) has been developed primarily for the Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) environment, with varying line conditions where the system that uses ANCP consists of DSLAMs (DSL access multiplexers) and terminal equipment. In this scenario, the channel conditions on subscriber lines vary, forcing changes and adaptations in line rates at the modem equipment, and affecting services offered. Satellite communications service providers have very similar issues and are also based around hubs, with satellite terminals. This application of ANCP could also be extended to point- to-point radio services in both the satellite and terrestrial domain.</t>
