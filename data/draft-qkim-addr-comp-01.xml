    <abstract>
      <t>The OSI service/protocol and Internet TCP/IP suite are typical protocol architectures for data transport in computer communications. A protocol architecture designs its own addressing scheme to distinguish communication objects. The OSI domain has developed an addressing system based on ITU-T Recommendation X.200 | ISO/IEC 7498 OSI Reference Model while the Internet has advertised its own way of addressing. It is necessary to understand them and to analyze the mapping relationship between them so that OSI services and protocols can be adapted over IP-based networks or a transport layer protocol can be developed for both OSI and IP networks. Additionally this memo can serve as a reference in order to produce an address interpretation scheme between SCN (Switched Circuit Network) and IP network.</t>
