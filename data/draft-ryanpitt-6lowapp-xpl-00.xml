      <t>This document proposes an Extensible Presentation Language (XPL) andXPL Type Resolution Protocol to be used as the basis for buildingprotocols in the application area addressed by the IETF 6lowpan andproposed 6lowApp Working Groups. This comprises applications forhighly resource-constrained devices over wireless networks, where thedevices are: power-constrained; ubiquitous; potentially very small;heterogeneous; have very short duty cycles (e.g. 0.1%); and areinstalled or used for many years on end, e.g. 'smart' electricitymeters, electric cars, etc.</t>
