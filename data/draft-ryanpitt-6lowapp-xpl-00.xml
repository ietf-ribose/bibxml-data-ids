      <t>This document proposes an Extensible Presentation Language (XPL) and XPL Type Resolution Protocol to be used as the basis for building protocols in the application area addressed by the IETF 6lowpan and proposed 6lowApp Working Groups. This comprises applications for highly resource-constrained devices over wireless networks, where the devices are: power-constrained; ubiquitous; potentially very small; heterogeneous; have very short duty cycles (e.g. 0.1%); and are installed or used for many years on end, e.g. 'smart' electricity meters, electric cars, etc.</t>
