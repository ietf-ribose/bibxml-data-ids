    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the problem of distributed data discovery in edge computing, and in particular for computing-in-the-network (COIN), which may require both the marshalling of data at the outset of a computation and the persistence of the resultant data after the computation. Although the data might originate at the network edge, as more and more distributed data is created, processed, and stored, it becomes increasingly dispersed throughout the network. There needs to be a standard way to find it. New and existing protocols will need to be developed to support distributed data discovery at the network edge and beyond.</t>
