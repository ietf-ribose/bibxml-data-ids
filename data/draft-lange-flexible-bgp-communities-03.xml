      <t>This document defines a new attribute for BGP called the FlexibleCommunity attribute. Flexible Communities build on the experienceand utility of the standard BGP community, and the extended BGPcommunity attributes. This attribute allows operators to associatestructured information with a route or set of routes. Thisinformation can be then be used to execute routing policy. Anenhanced version of communities is necessary to accommodate IPv6,4-byte ASN's, and introduce a more extensible and flexible policyexpression. This document also introduces the concept of NeighborClasses. A Neighbor Class is applied to a group of BGP neighbors whoshare certain attributes. For example, the PEER Neighbor Class couldbe applied to BGP sessions between ASN X and other networks withwhich ASN X has a non-transit peering relationship.</t>
