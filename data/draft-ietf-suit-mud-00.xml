    <abstract>
      <t>The Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) specification describes the access and network functionality required a device to properly function. The MUD description has to reflect the software running on the device and its configuration. Because of this, the most appropriate entity for describing device network access requirements is the same as the entity developing the software and its configuration. A network presented with a MUD file by a device allows detection of misbehavior by the device software and configuration of access control. This document defines a way to link a SUIT manifest to a MUD file offering a stronger binding between the two.</t>
