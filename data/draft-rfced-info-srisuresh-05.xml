      <t>Basic Network Address Translation or Basic NAT is a feature by which IP addresses are mapped from one group to another, transparent to users. Network Address Port Translation, or NAPT is an extension to Basic NAT, in that many network addresses and their TCP/UDP ports are translated to a single network address and its TCP/UDP ports. Together, these two operations, traditionally referred to as NAT, provide a mechanism to connect an isolated routing realm with private unregistered addresses to the external routing network with globally unique registered addresses.</t>
