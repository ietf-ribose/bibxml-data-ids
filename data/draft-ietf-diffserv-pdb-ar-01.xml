      <t>This document describes a diffserv per-domain behaviour (PDB) calledAssured Rate (AR). The AR PDB is suitable for carrying trafficaggregates that require rate assurance but do not require delay andjitter bounds. The traffic aggregate will also have the opportunityto obtain excess bandwidth beyond the assured rate. The PDB can becreated using the diffserv AF PHB along with suitable policers at thedomain ingress nodes.</t>
