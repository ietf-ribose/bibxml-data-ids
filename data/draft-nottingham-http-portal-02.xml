      <t>"Captive portals" are a commonly-deployed means of obtaining access credentials and/or payment for a network. This memo introduces a new HTTP status code as a means of addressing issues found in these deployments. This memo should be discussed on the ietf-http-wg@w3.org mailing list, although it is not a work item of the HTTPbis WG.</t>
