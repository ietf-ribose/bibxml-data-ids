      <t>Access Point Names are used in wireless networks which are based on3GPP standards to identify a specific gateway element. A mobile nodewhich attaches via a 3GPP access network indicates the gateway towhich connectivity is desired by providing the gateways access pointname, in the network attach signaling messages. This documentspecifies a new DHCP option which enables the mobile node to requestconnectivity to a gateway, identified by the access point name, inDHCP messages. A mobile node whose mobility is managed by thenetwork using Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol may perform a handover fromone access technology to another. This document defines a DHCPoption which enables the host to indicate to Proxy Mobile IPv6elements in the access network if the attachment via the newinterface is a handover or a new connection.</t>
