    <abstract>
      <t>Host-to-network signaling can improve the user experience by informing the network which flows are more important and which packets within a flow are more important. The differentiated service may be provided at the network (e.g., packet prioritization), the sender (e.g., adaptive transmission), or through cooperation of both the sender and the network. This document outlines use-cases that highlight the need for a new signaling protocol from the receiver to its network elements which enables different traffic treatment.</t>
