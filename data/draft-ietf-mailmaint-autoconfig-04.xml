      <t>A protocol that allows email applications to set up mail accounts and related accounts with only the email address and password. It defines how service providers can publish the account configuration, so that email applications can automatically find a working configuration. It reduces setup friction for their users, and calls to the support for the service provider. Although the discovery process starts with an email address, the protocol is not limited setting up email accounts, but can also set up calendar, contact and file sync, video conference accounts and other accounts that are connected to the same user account. This protocol uses a well-known address and DNS lookups, based on the email address domain, to find the XML configuration file for the service provider.</t>
