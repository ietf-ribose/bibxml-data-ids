      <t>This document specifies INSIGNIA, an in-band signaling system forsupporting quality of service (QOS) in mobile ad hoc networks. Theterm `in-band signaling` refers to the fact that control informationis carried along with data in IP packets. We argue that in-bandsignaling is more suitable than explicit out-of-band approaches(e.g., RSVP) when supporting end-to-end quality of service in highlydynamic environments such as mobile ad hoc networks where networktopology, node connectivity and end-to-end quality of service arestrongly time-varying. INSIGNIA is designed to support the deliveryof adaptive real-time services and includes fastsession/flow/microflow reservation, restoration and adaptationalgorithms between source/destination pairs. In this memo we discusshow INSIGNIA fits into our broader vision of a wireless flowmanagement model for mobile ad hoc networks and how it interfaces tothe proposed MANET Working Group routing algorithm.</t>
