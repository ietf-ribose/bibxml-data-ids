      <t>This document specifies INSIGNIA, an in-band signaling system for supporting quality of service (QOS) in mobile ad hoc networks. The term `in-band signaling` refers to the fact that control information is carried along with data in IP packets. We argue that in-band signaling is more suitable than explicit out-of-band approaches (e.g., RSVP) when supporting end-to-end quality of service in highly dynamic environments such as mobile ad hoc networks where network topology, node connectivity and end-to-end quality of service are strongly time-varying. INSIGNIA is designed to support the delivery of adaptive real-time services and includes fast session/flow/microflow reservation, restoration and adaptation algorithms between source/destination pairs. In this memo we discuss how INSIGNIA fits into our broader vision of a wireless flow management model for mobile ad hoc networks and how it interfaces to the proposed MANET Working Group routing algorithm.</t>
