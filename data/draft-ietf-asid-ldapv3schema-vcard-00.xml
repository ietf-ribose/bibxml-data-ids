    <abstract>
      <t>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [LDAPV3] is gaining widespread acceptance as a method for accessing Internet directories. Many of the LDAP clients accessing these directories also provide support for emitting the directory information in the form of a vCard electronic business card object. This memo defines a new X.500 object class, called the vCardObject, that extends the X.521 standard organizationalPerson and residentialPerson in order to provide a unique LDAP schema for accessing Internet directories in terms of the vCard attributes. The schema defined by this memo should be used when accessing a directory via LDAP Version 3 and searching or retrieving directory information based on vCard related attributes. The schema describes the attribute types and object classes that have a 1-to-one correspondence with vCard properties. This schema may also be used to define a set of object classes and attributes for storing metadata and binding information for a directory entry that closely follows the vCard object in directories that support LDAP.</t>
