    <abstract>
      <t>This document outlines use cases and desirable properties for integrating remote attestation (RA) capabilities with secure channel establishment protocols, with an initial focus on Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.3 Handshake. Traditional peer authentication in TLS establishes trust in a peer's network identifiers but provides no assurance regarding the integrity of its underlying software and hardware stack. Remote attestation addresses this gap by enabling a peer to provide verifiable evidence about its current state, including the state of its trusted computing base (TCB). This document explores specific use cases, such as confidential data collaboration and secure secrets provisioning, to motivate the need for this integration. From these use cases, it specifies a set of essential properties the protocol solution must have, including cryptographic binding to the TLS connection, evidence freshness, and flexibility to support different attestation models. This document is intended to serve as an input to the design of protocol solutions within the SEAT working group.</t>
