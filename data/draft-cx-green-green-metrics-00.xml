    <abstract>
      <t>This document explains the need for network instrumentation that allows to assess a number of sustainability-related attributes such as power consumption, energy efficiency, and carbon footprint associated with a network, its equipment, and the services that are provided over it. It also suggests a set of related metrics that, when provided visibility into, can help to optimize a network's "greenness" accordingly. Note: This document replaces an earlier document in OPSAWG as the recently-established GREEN provides for a more fitting landing spot.</t>
