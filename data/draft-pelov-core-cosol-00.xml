      <t>This document presents a new type of far-reaching, low-rate radio technologies and an extensible mechanism to operate these networks based on CoAP. The emerging Wide Area Networks based on them - Low- Rate WAN (LR-WAN) preset a particular set of constraints, which places them at the intersection of infrastructure networks, ultra- dense networks, delay-tolerant networks and low-power and lossy networks. The main objectives of LR-WAN signaling is to minimize the number of exchanged messages, minimize the size of each message in a secure and extensible manner. This document describes the use of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) as the main signaling protocol for LR-WANs, over which minimal messages are exchanged allowing the full operation of the network, such as authentication, authorization, and management. The use of CoAP signaling provides a generic mechanism that can be applied to different LR-WAN technologies.</t>
