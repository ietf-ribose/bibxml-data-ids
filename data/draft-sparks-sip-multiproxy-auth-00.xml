      <t>SIP/2.0 as specified in RFC2543 provides a mechanism for a proxyinvolved in a SIP transaction to authenticate the originator of therequest. Unfortunately, this mechanism is not well defined when morethan one proxy in a requestâ€™s path desires such authentication. Thisdraft proposes a mechanism that would allow authentication in thatscenario to work as expected. Under this proposal, SIP clients wouldissue requests with multiple Proxy-Authorization headers, one foreach challenge it has seen in the lifetime of a given call leg.Authenticating SIP proxies would search each request for a Proxy-Authorization response to its own challenge, passing any othersdownstream unaltered.</t>
