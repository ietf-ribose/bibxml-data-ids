      <t>SIP/2.0 as specified in RFC2543 provides a mechanism for a proxy involved in a SIP transaction to authenticate the originator of the request. Unfortunately, this mechanism is not well defined when more than one proxy in a requestâ€™s path desires such authentication. This draft proposes a mechanism that would allow authentication in that scenario to work as expected. Under this proposal, SIP clients would issue requests with multiple Proxy-Authorization headers, one for each challenge it has seen in the lifetime of a given call leg. Authenticating SIP proxies would search each request for a Proxy- Authorization response to its own challenge, passing any others downstream unaltered.</t>
