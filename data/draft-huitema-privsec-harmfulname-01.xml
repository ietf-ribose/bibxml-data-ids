      <t>Giving a hostname to your computer and publishing it as you roam from network to hot spot is the Internet equivalent of walking around with a name tag affixed to your lapel. The practice can significantly compromise your privacy, and should stop. There are several possible remedies, such as fixing a variety of protocols or avoiding disclosing a hostname at all. This document studies another possible remedy, which is to replace the static hostnames by frequently changing randomized values. This idea obviously needs more work.</t>
