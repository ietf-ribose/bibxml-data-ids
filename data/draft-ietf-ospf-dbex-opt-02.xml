      <t>This document describes a backward compatible optimization for theDatabase Exchange process in OSPFv2 and OSPFv3. In thisoptimization, a router does not list an LSA in Database Descriptionpackets sent to a neighbor, if the same or a more recent instance ofthe LSA was listed in a Database Description packet already receivedfrom the neighbor. This optimization reduces Database Descriptionoverhead by about 50% in large networks. This optimization does notaffect synchronization, since it only omits unnecessary informationfrom Database Description packets.</t>
