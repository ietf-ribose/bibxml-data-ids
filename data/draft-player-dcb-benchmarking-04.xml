      <t>Existing benchmarking methodologies are based on the assumption thatnetworking devices will impartially drop network traffic at theirperformance limits. Data Center Bridging (DCB) devices, however,will attempt to throttle prioritized traffic from network endpointsbefore those limits are reached in order to minimize the probabilityof frame loss for high value traffic. Hence, existing methodologiesbased around indiscriminate frame loss are inappropriate for DCBdevices. This document takes the basic benchmarking ideas based onloss and extends them to support "lossless" Ethernet devices.</t>
