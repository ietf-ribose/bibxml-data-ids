    <abstract>
      <t>When small payloads are transmitted through a packet-switched network, the resulting overhead may result significant. This is stressed in the case of LISP, where a number of headers are prepended to a packet, as new headers have to be added to each packet. This document proposes to send together a number of small packets, which are in the buffer of a ITR, having the same ETR as destination, into a single packet. Therefore, they will share a single LISP header, and therefore bandwidth savings can be obtained, and a reduction in the overall number of packets sent to the network can be achieved.</t>
