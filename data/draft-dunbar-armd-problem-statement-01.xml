    <abstract>
      <t>Modern data center networks face a number of scale challenges. One such challenge for so-called "massive" data center networks is address resolution, such as is provided by ARP and/or ND. This document describes the problem of address resolution in massive data centers. It discusses the network impact of various data center technologies including server virtualization, illustrates reasons why it is still desirable to have multiple hosts on the same Layer 2 data center network, and describes potential address resolution problems this type of Layer 2 network will face.</t>
