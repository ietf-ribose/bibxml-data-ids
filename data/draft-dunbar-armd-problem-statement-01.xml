      <t>Modern data center networks face a number of scale challenges. Onesuch challenge for so-called "massive" data center networks isaddress resolution, such as is provided by ARP and/or ND. Thisdocument describes the problem of address resolution in massive datacenters. It discusses the network impact of various data centertechnologies including server virtualization, illustrates reasonswhy it is still desirable to have multiple hosts on the same Layer 2data center network, and describes potential address resolutionproblems this type of Layer 2 network will face.</t>
