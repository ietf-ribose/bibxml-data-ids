      <t>Software Defined Networking proposes the separation of the control plane from the data plane in the network nodes and its logical centralization on a control entity. Most of the network intelligence is moved to this functional entity. Typically, such entity is seen as a compendium of interacting control functions in a vertical, tight integrated fashion. The relocation of the control functions from a number of distributed network nodes to a logical central entity conceptually places together a number of control capabilities with different purposes. As a consequence, the existing solutions do not provide a clear separation between transport control and services that relies upon transport capabilities. This document describes a proposal named Cooperating Layered Architecture for SDN. The idea behind that is to differentiate the control functions associated to transport from those related to services, in such a way that they can be provided and maintained independently, and can follow their own evolution path.</t>
