      <t>Congestion Exposure (ConEx) is a mechanism by which senders inform the network about the congestion encountered by previous packets on the same flow. Reliable auditing is necessary to provide a strong incentive to declare ConEx information honestly. This document defines how the signals are handled by an audit and lists requirements for an audit implementation. This document does not mandate a particular design but identifies state and functions that any auditor element must provide to fulfill the requirements stated in [draft-ietf-conex-abstract-mech].</t>
