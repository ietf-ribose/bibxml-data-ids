      <t>When a large number of clients register with a SIP registrar serverat approximately the same time, the server may become overloaded.Near-simultaneous floods of SIP SUBSCRIBE and PUBLISH requests mayhave similar effects. Such request avalanches can occur, forexample, after a power failure and recovery in a metropolitan area.This document describes how to avoid such overload situations. Underthis mechanism, a server estimates an avalanche restart backoffinterval during its normal operation and conveys this interval to itsclients through a new Restart-Timer header in normal responsemessages. Once an avalanche restart actually occurs, the clientsperform backoff based on the previously received Restart-Timer headervalue before sending out the first request attempt. Thus, themechanism spreads all the initial client requests and prevents themfrom overloading the server.</t>
