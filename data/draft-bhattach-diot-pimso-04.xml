      <t>This document considers the requirements for implementing PIM Source-Only (PIM-SO) which will allow the creation of source-based multicasttrees across multiple domains in the Internet. PIM-SO realizes theEXPRESS [HOLB99] multicast service model in which there is a singlesource for every multicast group, and group membership and addressingis based on a multicast group address (G) as well as the source'sunicast address (S). Our short-term goal is to implement PIM-SO withminimal changes to the current multicast routing infrastructure byAugust 2000, and to provide proof of concept by deploying it onSprintlab's experimental network. By the end of the year, we envisagethat PIM-SO will be ready to be incorporated in Sprint's multicastbackbone as a commercial point-to-multipoint service.</t>
