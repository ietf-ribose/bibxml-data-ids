      <t>This document considers the requirements for implementing PIM Source- Only (PIM-SO) which will allow the creation of source-based multicast trees across multiple domains in the Internet. PIM-SO realizes the EXPRESS [HOLB99] multicast service model in which there is a single source for every multicast group, and group membership and addressing is based on a multicast group address (G) as well as the source's unicast address (S). Our short-term goal is to implement PIM-SO with minimal changes to the current multicast routing infrastructure by August 2000, and to provide proof of concept by deploying it on Sprintlab's experimental network. By the end of the year, we envisage that PIM-SO will be ready to be incorporated in Sprint's multicast backbone as a commercial point-to-multipoint service.</t>
