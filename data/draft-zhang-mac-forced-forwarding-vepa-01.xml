      <t>If MAC Forced Forwarding (RFC4562) is enabled on Top Of Rack switches, ARPing messages exchanged within a Customer Premises Network should be discarded. However, when Virtual Ethernet Port Aggregator is deployed in the Customer Premises Network, this kind of discarding may disconnect VMs within the same subnet. This document suggests interfaces should be differentiated to address this problem.</t>
