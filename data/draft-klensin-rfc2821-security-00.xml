      <t>RFC 3552 is a useful analysis and presentation of recommendations for Security Considerations Sections. Part of its content is an extensive analysis of, and proposed replacement for, the Security Considerations section of RFC 2821. In important respects, the proposed replacement text may not be appropriate for this type of document. It also raises some specific issues that may not be consistent with the consensus community of email experts about best practice. Given the way it is worded, and the fact that it was published as a BCP document, it is plausible to consider it as an Update to RFC 2821 and to consider its "example" to be normative for any future revision of RFC 2821 such as the work that has been started in [7]. Those perceptions should be definitively evaluated and corrected if necessary. This document is a first step in doing so and also makes some specific additional suggestions about the handling of Security Considerations material.</t>
