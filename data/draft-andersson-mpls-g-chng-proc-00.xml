      <t>This memo describes the process through which individuals, working groups and external standards bodies can influence the development of MPLS and GMPLS standards. With respect to standardization, this process means that (G)MPLS extensions and changes can be done through the IETF only, the body that created the (G)MPLS technology. The IETF will not publish a (G)MPLS technology extension RFC outside of the processes described here.</t>
