      <t>This document tries to address a problem of delivering redundantcontent of a dynamic web page to the same client over theInternet. The dynamic web page made up of two kind of data firstone comes from external sources such as database or some textfiles etc which is dynamic in the nature and may change overthe next request made from the same client, the second one isstatic in the nature such as formatting tag of html[3] whichremain unchanged until the program of dynamic web page doesnot modified.Instead of sending the whole page at each subsequent requestfrom the same client it is better to send the dynamic data andclient can use the static data from the cache of previousresponse to format the dynamic data of current response.</t>
