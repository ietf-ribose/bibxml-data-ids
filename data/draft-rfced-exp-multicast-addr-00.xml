      <t>The purpose of this document is to describe an architecture and protocol for a multicast address allocation server. The proposed method employs a distributed 'nameserver' architecture, and defines a MultiCast NameServer Protocol (MCNSP) which specifies the manner in which nameservers interact with one another. MCNSP is designed to support allocation of multicast addresses at any network layer on which multicasting itself is supported (IP, Ethernet MAC, etc.). The protocol is designed to use a minimal amount of network bandwidth, while the distributed architecture allows a network administrator to configure nameservers to achieve high levels of fault tolerance.</t>
