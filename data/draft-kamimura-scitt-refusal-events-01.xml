      <t>This document describes a SCITT-based mechanism for creating verifiable records of AI content refusal events. It defines how refusal decisions can be encoded as SCITT Signed Statements, registered with Transparency Services, and verified by third parties using Receipts. This specification provides auditability of refusal decisions that are logged, not cryptographic proof that no unlogged generation occurred. It does not define content moderation policies, classification criteria, or what AI systems should refuse; it addresses only the audit trail mechanism. This revision (-01) incorporates lessons from the January 2026 Grok NCII incident, aligns with the CAP-SRP v1.0 specification, and addresses emerging regulatory requirements including EU AI Act Article 12/50 and the Korea AI Basic Act.</t>
