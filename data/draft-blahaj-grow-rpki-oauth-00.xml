    <abstract>
      <t>The Peering API currently under discussion in the GROW Working Group does not provide a standardised mechanism to authenticate parties engaged in the Peering API. This document specifies a method to attest as to the identities of parties in an OpenID Connect (OIDC) exchange, binding the authentication flow to agents of ASNs. Discussion This note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC. Source for this draft and an issue tracker can be found at https://github.molgen.mpg.de/q/rpki-peering-api-discovery.</t>
