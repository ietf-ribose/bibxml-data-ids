      <t>LDAP provides some simple primitives to construct searchfilters. Complex LDAP search queries such as those involvingjoins or functional evaluation of simple query results requireclient side processing of the intermediate search results. Thenetwork overhead of retrieving intermediate results can besubstantial for large databases. This document defines an LDAPextension for supporting server side evaluation of complexsearch queries. Custom search logic can be sent across to the server, encapsulated as a Java Object. The LDAP server supporting this extension would instantiate the java object and invoke its well known interfaces in a JVM. The java object running at the server end acts as the client-proxy, and makes a local search query to the LDAP server. The directory entries are evaluated using the custom logic embedded in the client-proxy, and those that satisfy the evaluation function are returned as the search result to the LDAP server, which passes it back to the originating client. Even non-Java LDAP clients can use this method, provided the search query is written as a java object.</t>
