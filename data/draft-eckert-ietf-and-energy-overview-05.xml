      <t>This memo provides an overview of work performed by or proposed within the IETF related to energy and/or green: awareness, management, control or reduction of consumption of energy, and sustainability as it related to the IETF. This document is written to help those unfamiliar with that work, but interested in it, in the hope to raise more interest in energy- related activities within the IETF, such as identifying gaps and investigating solutions as appropriate. This document captures work until 12/2022, at which time the "IAB workshop on Environmental Impact of Internet Applications and Systems" (https://www.iab.org/activities/workshops/e-impact/) creaeted new interest and work in the topic.</t>
