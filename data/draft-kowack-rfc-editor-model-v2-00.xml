      <t>The RFC Editor publishes the Internet's archival series of technical and informational documents. RFC 5620 defines RFC Editor Model Version 1, whose implementation began in January 2010. Model 1 divides RFC Editor activities into a number of components, including the RFC Series Editor (RSE). During 2010, a "Transitional RFC Series Editor" performed and evaluated the RSE role. Based on direct experience, extensive discussions with the community, and research, the TRSE provides this updated version of RFC 5620. This draft revises the RSE job description, and makes recommendations for the search and selection process for a permanent RSE. This memo also clarifies RFC Editor and RSE activities using established approaches of management and oversight of a publication service, tailored for the style of the Internet technical community. Careful attention is paid to ensuring stable operations. This document observes that RSE responsibilities demand a very high level of editorial and managerial expertise.</t>
