      <t>The Calendar Access Protocol (CAP) is an Internet protocol for accessing an [ICAL] based calendar store (CS) from a calendar user agent (CUA). The purpose of this document is to set forth a list of requirements that CAP MUST address in order to meet the needs of the calendaring and scheduling community. This document is based on discussions within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Calendaring and Scheduling (CALSCH) working group. More information about the IETF CALSCH working group activities can be found on the IMC web site at http://www.imc.org, the IETF web site at http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/calsch-charter.html.
