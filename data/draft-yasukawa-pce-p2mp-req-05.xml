      <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computationfunctions in support of traffic engineering in Multi-Protocol LabelSwitching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.Extensions to the MPLS and GMPLS signaling and routing protocols havebeen made in support of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineered(TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). The use of PCE in MPLS networks isalready established, and since P2MP TE LSP routes are sometimescomplex to compute, it is likely that PCE will be used for P2MP LSPs.Generic requirements for a communication protocol between PathComputation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are presented in "PathComputation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol GenericRequirements". This document complements the generic requirements andpresents a detailed set of PCC-PCE communication protocolrequirements for point-to-multipoint MPLS/GMPLS traffic engineering.</t>
