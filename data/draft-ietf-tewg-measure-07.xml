      <t>In this document, we identify requirements for supporting the traffic engineering of IP networks. Requirements for traffic measurement in service provider environments are presented and justified, and related issues are discussed. Highlights of requirements are: 1. To aid network dimensioning, mechanisms to collect node-pair- based traffic data are required to facilitate the derivation of per- service-class traffic matrix statistics. 2. For service assurance, the use of higher-order statistics is required. 3. To preserve representative traffic detail at manageable sample volumes, packet-sampled measurements are required. 4. To manage large volumes of measured data, use of bulk transfer and filtering/aggregation mechanisms are required.</t>
