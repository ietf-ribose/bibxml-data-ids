      <t>This paper defines the requirements for a DNS-based architecture and protocols for mapping a telephone number to a set of attributes (e.g., URLs) which can be used to contact a resource associated with that number. There are many possible protocols that can be considered for a telephone number mapping service. The purpose of this document is to focus discussion on a DNS-based solution. The intention is to enumerate the expectations of such a solution and to clarify the scope.</t>
