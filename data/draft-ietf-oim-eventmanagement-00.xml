    <title>Tutorial on OSI Event Management, Alarm Reporting, and Log Control for TCP/IP Networks</title>
    <date year="1990" month="February" day="1"/>
    <abstract>
      <t>This draft provides a tutorial on OSI mechanisms for event management, alarm reporting, and log control in TCP/IP networks. The mechanisms are based on ISO Draft Proposals and are expected to align with agreements developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Network Management Forum (NMF). Also included is a mechanism for incorporating event flow control as defined in the Internet. It is proposed that systems implementing OSI management protocols for TCP/IP networks [1] should include the mechanisms described in this draft.</t>
