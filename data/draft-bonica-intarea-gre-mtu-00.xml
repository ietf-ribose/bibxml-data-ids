      <t>This memo documents a GRE fragmentation strategy upon which many vendors have converged. Specifically, it defines procedures to be executed by GRE ingress routers. It is published so that those building new implementations will be aware of best common practice. It is also published so that those building applications over GRE will understand how GRE works.</t>
