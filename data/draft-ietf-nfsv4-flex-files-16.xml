      <t>The Parallel Network File System (pNFS) allows a separation between the metadata (onto a metadata server) and data (onto a storage device) for a file. The flexible file layout type is defined in this document as an extension to pNFS which allows the use of storage devices in a fashion such that they require only a quite limited degree of interaction with the metadata server, using already existing protocols. Client-side mirroring is also added to provide replication of files.</t>
