      <t>This document describes a protocol that provides IP reachability for mobile users. Like IP Mobility Support, RFC 2002, each mobile node is accessible by its home address, regardless of its current location in the Internet. When away from home, the mobile node acquires a care-of address indicating its current location. It registers the care-of address with a registration server (RS). The RS setups a reverse twice network address translation (RAT) table on a RAT device. The RAT device transparently routes datagrams destined for the mobile node's home address to the care-of address by reverse twice network address translation. The protocol requirements for the mobile node is minimal. End-users can have mobility support easily as registration is done using widely available applications.</t>
