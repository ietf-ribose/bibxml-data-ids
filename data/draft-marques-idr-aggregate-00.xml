      <t>This document defines a mechanism which allows more-specific IP address prefixes to be aggregated when they are topologically equivalent or less preferable than a less-specific advertisement. It is designed to allow multi-homed sites to use "Provider Aggregatable" (PA) addresses and obtain both redundancy and local traffic optimizations when using multiple service providers.</t>
