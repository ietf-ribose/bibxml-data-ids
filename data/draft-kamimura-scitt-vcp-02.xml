      <t>This document defines a profile of the SCITT (Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust) architecture for creating tamper-evident audit trails of AI-driven algorithmic trading decisions and executions. The VeritasChain Protocol (VCP) applies the SCITT framework to address the specific requirements of financial markets, including high-precision timestamps, regulatory compliance considerations (EU AI Act, MiFID II), and privacy-preserving mechanisms (crypto-shredding) compatible with GDPR. This profile specifies how VCP events are encoded as SCITT Signed Statements, registered with Transparency Services, and verified using COSE Receipts.</t>
