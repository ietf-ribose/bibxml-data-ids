      <t>It is a great challenge to design the right packet format for the Information-Centric Networking (ICN), because this new architecture is still in its research stage. We do not have good prediction regarding either the technology advances or the application needs may involve in next 10 years. To minimize the chance of premature constraints in the packet format design, we believe it is important to first clearly identify the design requirements, so that we can use the requirements to guide the design effort. In this document we describe our understanding of the design requirements and their tradeoffs.</t>
