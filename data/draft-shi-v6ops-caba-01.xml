      <t>Addressing is the foundation of routing and it impacts the routing scalability. The IPv6 routing system will face severe scalability issue if the IPv6 addresses are recklessly used without careful aggregation strategy. This draft describes an addressing scheme and the corresponding allocation scheme which can facilitate the aggregation of IPv6 addresses and keep the IPv6 inter-domain routing system from being overloaded.</t>
