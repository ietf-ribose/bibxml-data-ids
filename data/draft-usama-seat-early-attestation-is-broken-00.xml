      <t>Sheffer et al. published [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] on 9th January, 2025 and despite being wildly out of scope of SEAT charter, the draft made its place -- getting two-thirds of meeting time -- in the agenda for upcoming SEAT interim meeting within hours of publishing. In comparison, our request to present [I-D.fossati-seat-expat] fully within the charter was refused. In this document, we disprove the claim made in [I-D.fossati-seat-early-attestation] for backward compatibility with standard TLS [I-D.ietf-tls-rfc8446bis]. We argue that [I-D.fossati-seat-expat] is a much more reaonsable way of achieving the goal within the scope of SEAT charter.</t>
