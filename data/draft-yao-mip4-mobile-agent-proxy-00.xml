      <t>In some networks such as xDSL networks with WiFi extension, theperiodical transmission of Agent Advertisements (AA) by mobility agents is used by Mobile Nodes (MN) to detect movement. To allow fastmovement detection, the interval at which AAs are sent should not belong. In the early deployment of Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4), mobility agentsare deployed in the edge network. For example, in xDSL networks, HomeAgents (HA) and Foreign Agents (FA) are located on or beside EdgeRouters (ER) that usually serves thousands of MNs (typically between2000 and 5000 in xDSL networks). The periodical transmission ofmulticast AA to MNs in such a large network consumes a significantamount of the aggregation network bandwidth and CPU resources of ERs.This is a practical problem in xDSL networks with WiFi extension. This is also a common problem for others access networks in which a large layer-2 network is served by one router. Hence a Mobility Agent Discovery proxy (MADP) can be set in access nodes to make the MNs detect movement fast meanwhile avoiding CPU and network bandwidthconsumption in the aggregation network. The MADP acts as a proxy toMNs as far as agent discovery is concerned allowing for AS issued byMNs to be locally replied according to AA issued by HA/FA on theaccess network. MADP is a logical function that can be placed on asuitable node location depending on access network technology andarchitecture (i.e. WiMAX) to reduce network resource cost related toagent discovery.</t>
