      <t>The Content Network Advertisement Protocol (CNAP) is a protocol Intended to facilitate the interconnection of Content Networks (CN). CNAP is a simple CN-to-CN information exchange protocol that advertises both content and area advertisements. These two types of advertisements are described in [3,6] and are intended to be used by content network request routing systems [9]. The exchange of these advertisements between CNs is intended to facilitate inter-CN request-routing decisions.</t>
