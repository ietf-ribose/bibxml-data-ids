      <t>This document specifies the Proof of Process (PoP) Evidence Framework, a specialized profile of Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) designed to validate the provenance of effort in digital authorship. Unlike traditional provenance, which tracks file custody, PoP attests to the continuous physical process of creation. The protocol defines a cryptographic mechanism for generating Evidence Packets utilizing a composite Sequential Work Function (SWF) based on Proof of Biological Space-Time (PoBST) to enforce temporal monotonicity and Cross-Domain Constraint Entanglement (CDCE) to bind behavioral entropy (human jitter) and physical state to the document. Technical specifications for wire formats, sequential work functions, and hardware-anchored trust are provided.</t>
