      <t>Traffic localization for peer-to-peer applications is currentlydiscussed by the IETF ALTO working group. The protocol specificationitself is discussed and some issues about load reduction for ALTO/P4Pservers are also discussed, but mainly on the transport level (i.e.,caching of traffic localization data) and some data aggregation byusing macros that comprise a number of IP prefixes. However, thereare no considerations about reducing the query load to the ALTOserver. This memo aims at giving informational guidance to P2Papplications implementers on how reduce the query load for ALTO.</t>
