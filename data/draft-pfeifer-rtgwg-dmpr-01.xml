    <abstract>
      <t>Dynamic MultiPath Routing (DMPR) is a loop free path vector routing protocol with built-in support for policy based multipath routing. It has been designed from scratch to work at both low and high bandwidth networks - even with high packet loss. The objective was to keep routing overhead low and ensure a deterministic protocol exchange behavior. DMPR can be used to manage larger networks with characteristics based on BGPv4 with transport and self-configuration properties taken from OSPF/OLSR. Unlike BGPv4 or OSPF, DMPR does not support higher network separation concepts. A DMPR network is a flat network in which DMPR nodes have equal tasks. This also applies to DMPR communication. Unlike OLSR/OSPF there is no flooding messages (topology broadcast), information are stored, accumulated/compressed and forwarded at each DMPR node. This feature contributes to the message load being deterministic.</t>
