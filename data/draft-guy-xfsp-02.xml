    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents a binary IP-based protocol to facilitate interoperable communications between electronic equipment on a platform. The protocol is UDP-based, stateless, and multicast. Messages consist of a common header followed by a series of parameters and related attributes. The parameters are always informational, e.g., indicating airspeed is 150 kts, but parameter attributes can be set to indicate intent, e.g., this parameter contains a new user selected value such as an instruction that deploys the landing gear. Although initially designed for avionics, it can be applied to other platform domains as well. This document defines the core protocol and a method to extend it to meet any domain specific needs.</t>
