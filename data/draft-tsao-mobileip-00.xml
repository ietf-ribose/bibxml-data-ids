      <t>Mobile IPv4 and mobile IPv6 have been developed to enhance IPv4 and IPv6 to have mobility support respectively. To solve the triangular routing problem in mobile IP, routing optimization mechanism is proposed for mobile IPv4 as well as mobile IPv6 defines routing optimization as an absolute requirement. However, the routing optimization procedures and the address binding messages are different in mobile IPv4 and mobile IPv6.</t>
