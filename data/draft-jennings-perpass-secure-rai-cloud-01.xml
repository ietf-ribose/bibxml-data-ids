      <t>The Internet technical community is looking at ways to address pervasive attacks as described in several other internet drafts. [I-D.barnes-pervasive-problem] describes threat model to characterize various pervasive attacks on the Internet communications. There are many systems that need to be secured against such attacks but this paper considers one possible way to secure cloud based collaborations systems. At a high level, this paper sugests that users or enterprises could run a key server that manages the keys to access their content. The cloud service provider would not have access to decrypt the data stored in the cloud but various users of the cloud service could get the keys to encrypt and decrypt the contents of collaboration sessions facilitated by the cloud service. This does not protect the meta data of who is talking to who but can help protect the content of the conversations.</t>
