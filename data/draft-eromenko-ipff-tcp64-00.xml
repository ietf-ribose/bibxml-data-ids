      <t>This document attempts to modernize TCP protocol for new reality, faster bandwidth, encryption-optimization and optional checksums, which is required for Identity-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) compatibility. This extension is backwards compatible with the original TCP specification during session establishment, but not compatible during the rest of the session nor with deployed middleboxes.</t>
