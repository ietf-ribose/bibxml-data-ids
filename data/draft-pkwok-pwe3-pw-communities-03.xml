      <t>[RFC4447]describes a set of procedures for Pseudowire set-up and maintenance using LDP as signaling protocol. [I-D.ietf-pwe3-dynamic-ms-pw] extends the mechanisms described in [RFC4447] for dynamic placement of multi- segment pseudowires. This document describes an extension to [RFC4447]procedures which may be used to pass additional information to S-PE/T-PEs when SS-PWs or MS-PWs are set-up. The intention of the proposed technique is to aid in policy administration, specifically during MS-PW set-up across various S-PEs. The proposed method is very generic so that it can support the management of various parameters or rules while setting up pseudowires with minimal overhead.</t>
