      <t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is a generic frameworksupporting multiple types of authentication methods. In systemswhere EAP is used for authentication, it is desirable to not repeatthe entire EAP exchange with another authenticator. This documentspecifies extensions to EAP and the EAP keying hierarchy to supportan EAP method-independent protocol for efficient re-authenticationbetween the peer and an EAP re-authentication server through anyauthenticator. The re-authentication server may be in the homenetwork or in the local network to which the peer is connecting.</t>
