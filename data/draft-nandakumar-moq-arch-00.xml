    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the media and security architecture for Media Over QUIC, a protocol suite intended to run in browsers and other non-browser endpoints and support unified architecture and protocol for data delivery that enables a wide range of media applications with different resiliency and latency needs without compromising the scalability and cost effectiveness associated with content delivery networks. Note to readers: This document as it stands might not reflect accurately all decisions that are in active discussions in the WG, but it lays out a foundation for expected architectural requirements. The specification will be updated based on the decision made in the WG.</t>
