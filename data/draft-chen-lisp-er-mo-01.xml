      <t>This document describes a mechanism of providing mapping service forLISP-like architecture. The mapping service comprises of EID Router(ER) mechanism and supplementary DHT Mapping Overlay (MO), in whichER mechanism is for reducing forwarding entries in routers whiledriving the packets to the destination through tunnels, and the DHTMO serves as a supplement that provides specific mappings to reducethe number of tunnels. The mechanism is flexibly deployable for ISPssince it costs little and is easy to progress.</t>
