      <t>Some HTTP servers provide a subset of resources that require additional authentication to interact with. HTTP/1.1 servers rely on TLS renegotiation that is triggered by a request to a protected resource. HTTP/2 made this pattern impossible by forbidding the use of TLS renegotiation. This document describes a how client authentication might be requested by a server as a result of receiving a request to a protected resource. This document updates RFC 7540 to allow TLS renegotiation in limited circumstances.</t>
