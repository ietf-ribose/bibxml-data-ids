    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a Fully-Specified FEC scheme, correspondingto FEC Encoding ID XXX, for the RaptorG forward error correction codeand its application to reliable delivery of data objects.RaptorG codes are a new family of codes to provide superiorflexibility, larger source block sizes and better coding efficiencythan Raptor codes in RFC5053. RaptorG is also a fountain code, i.e.,as many encoding symbols as needed can be generated by the encoderon-the-fly from the source symbols of a source block of data. Thedecoder is able to recover the source block from any set of encodingsymbols for most cases equal to the number of source symbols and inrare cases with slightly more than the number of source symbols.The RaptorG code described here is a systematic code, meaning thatall the source symbols are among the encoding symbols that can begenerated.Status of this MemoThis Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with theprovisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet EngineeringTask Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.
