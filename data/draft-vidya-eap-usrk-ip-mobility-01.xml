      <t>EAP [1] is increasingly used for network access authentication in various networks. Also, key generating EAP methods are being adopted in various systems for the purposes of cryptographic protection between an EAP peer and an enforcement point in the network. Key generating EAP methods produce an MSK and an EMSK in accordance with [1]. The MSK is meant for use by the EAP lower layer at the peer and the authenticator and is used differently by various lower layers. The EMSK hierarchy is defined in [2]. The EMSK hierarchy is meant to be extensible to derive keys for various usages. This document defines the key hierarchy and key derivations for using the EMSK hierarchy for keying in IP mobility protocols.</t>
