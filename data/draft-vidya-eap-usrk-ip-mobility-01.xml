      <t>EAP [1] is increasingly used for network access authentication invarious networks. Also, key generating EAP methods are being adoptedin various systems for the purposes of cryptographic protectionbetween an EAP peer and an enforcement point in the network. Keygenerating EAP methods produce an MSK and an EMSK in accordance with[1]. The MSK is meant for use by the EAP lower layer at the peer andthe authenticator and is used differently by various lower layers.The EMSK hierarchy is defined in [2]. The EMSK hierarchy is meant tobe extensible to derive keys for various usages. This documentdefines the key hierarchy and key derivations for using the EMSKhierarchy for keying in IP mobility protocols.</t>
