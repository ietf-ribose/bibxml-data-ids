      <t>In this document, a concept of main directory agent (MDA) is introduced.The main directory agent utilizes conjoined operations of Mobile IP andSLP including new proposed extensions. The MDA expedites service &amp;location discovery process for mobile hosts and provides local systemadministrators with control over the usage of deployed services. Itprovides a mechanism for local system administrators to enforce localpolicies for the allocation of local access resources when desired. The MDA based service discovery by mobile hosts is particularlyeffective in the case of wireless networks. Wireless links havesubstantially lower bandwidth, suffer from higher error rates and needto support higher mobility of hosts/data terminals compared to wiredlinks (e.g. LAN). Thus, to disseminate any information to mobile hostsover the wireless links the multicasting or broadcasting paradigmshould be used sparingly. In view of this, optional extensions to Mobile IP and SLP protocol arerecommended and discussed in this document. Again, the intent is tomake the overall service discovery process expeditious and effectivefor mobile hosts.</t>
