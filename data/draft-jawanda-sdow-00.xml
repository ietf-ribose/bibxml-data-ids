      <t>In this document, a concept of main directory agent (MDA) is introduced. The main directory agent utilizes conjoined operations of Mobile IP and SLP including new proposed extensions. The MDA expedites service &amp; location discovery process for mobile hosts and provides local system administrators with control over the usage of deployed services. It provides a mechanism for local system administrators to enforce local policies for the allocation of local access resources when desired. The MDA based service discovery by mobile hosts is particularly effective in the case of wireless networks. Wireless links have substantially lower bandwidth, suffer from higher error rates and need to support higher mobility of hosts/data terminals compared to wired links (e.g. LAN). Thus, to disseminate any information to mobile hosts over the wireless links the multicasting or broadcasting paradigm should be used sparingly. In view of this, optional extensions to Mobile IP and SLP protocol are recommended and discussed in this document. Again, the intent is to make the overall service discovery process expeditious and effective for mobile hosts.</t>
