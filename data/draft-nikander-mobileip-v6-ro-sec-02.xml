      <t>This document is a succint account of the rationale behind the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) Route Optimization Security Design. The purpose of this document is to present the thinking and to preserve the reasoning behind the Mobile IPv6 Security Design in 2001-2002. The document has two target audiences: (1) MIPv6 implementors (so that they can better understand the design choices in MIPv6 security procedures); and (2) people dealing with mobility or multi-homing (so that they can avoid a number of potential security pitfalls in their design).</t>
