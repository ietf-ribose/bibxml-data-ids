      <t>This draft describes the methodology for benchmarking MPLS protection mechanisms using the terminology defined in [TERMID]. An overview of existing MPLS protection terminology and functionality is provided as as background for the methodology. The methodology can be applied to any MPLS protection mechanisms such as Standby LSP, Fast Reroute Detour Mode, and Fast Reroute Bypass Mode. The methodology can also be used to benchmark LSP rerouting due to a Headend Reroute. The data plane is measured to obtain the benchmarking metrics. Discussion is included to explain the differences between MPLS Protection mechanisms, the network events that cause failover, and the benefits of measuring the data plane for black-box MPLS Protection benchmarking. Measurements can be used to compare failover performance of different Label-Switched Routers and evaluate the different MPLS protection mechanisms.</t>
