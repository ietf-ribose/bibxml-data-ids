      <t>Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) defines an architectural framework and associated protocols to standardize information exchange between the control plane and the forwarding plane in a ForCES Network Element (ForCES NE). RFC5812 has defined the ForCES Model which provides a formal way to represent the capabilities, state, and configuration of forwarding elements(FEs) within the context of the ForCES protocol. More specifically, the model describes the logical functions that are present in an FE, what capabilities these functions support, and how these functions are or can be interconnected. The control elements (CEs) can control the FEs using the ForCES model definition. The ForCES WG charter has been extended to allow the LFB topology to be across FEs. This documents describes a non-intrusive way to extend the LFB topology across FEs.</t>
