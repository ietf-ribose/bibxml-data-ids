    <abstract>
      <t>Complex telephony networks using SIP signalling such as the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) of the Third Generation Partnership (3GPP) serve diverse customer groups, including business and retail clients, with various products like mobile, fixed, and PBX services. Such services have the problem of different handling of the services. This may end up in a complex analysis of the signalling syntax before starting the required procedures for calls based on their service provided to the customer. With the introduction of microservice based technologies the complexity increases. This draft describes a generic identification mechanism for SIP dialogs in using an identifier indicating the service/product which the customer is using to allow an efficient processing of the SIP dialog and session.</t>
