      <t>The document "A Framework for Centralized Conferencing" defines a centralized conference as both signaling and protocol agnostic. The primary examples within this framework focus on audio and video as the media types for the session. This document provides an overview of the mechanisms defined in the centralized conferencing framework that can be used to support multi-user chat. In addition, the document describes additional functionality and requirements necessary to provide feature rich functionality.</t>
