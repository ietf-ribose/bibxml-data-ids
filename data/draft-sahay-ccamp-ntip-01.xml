      <t>This draft describes the transport network interface protocol (NTIP) for photonic cross connects (PXC). NTIP is implemented between a PXC and transport network element (TNEs), also known as line systems. NTIP is a protocol that uses TCP/IP for the transport of information related to defect notification, trace monitoring, adjacency discovery, and diagnostic messages between directly attached PXC and TNE. The use of TCP as the transport protocol ensures reliable and in-sequence delivery of NTIP messages.</t>
