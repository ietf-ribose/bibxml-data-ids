      <t>The SNMPv2 Working Group has accomplished much good work thus far by refining and extending the definition of management information, by improving protocol operations in several important ways, and by enriching and formalizing compliance statements. Improvements in these areas have been discussed and consensus has been reached on a set of documents that are ready to be moved forward to Draft Standard on the Internet standards track.</t>
