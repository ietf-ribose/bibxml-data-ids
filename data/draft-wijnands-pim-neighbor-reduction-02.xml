      <t>PIM establishes a neighbor relationship with other routers directlyconnected to it on startup. Networks that are LANs or behave like aLAN, potentially create many PIM neighbors depending on how manyrouters are attached to it. If such a LAN is also a transit network(no directly connected source or receiver), many of the PIMprocedures don't apply. This proposal describes a procedure toreduce the amount of neighbors established over a transit LAN.</t>
