    <abstract>
      <t>PIM establishes a neighbor relationship with other routers directly connected to it on startup. Networks that are LANs or behave like a LAN, potentially create many PIM neighbors depending on how many routers are attached to it. If such a LAN is also a transit network (no directly connected source or receiver), many of the PIM procedures don't apply. This proposal describes a procedure to reduce the amount of neighbors established over a transit LAN.</t>
