    <abstract>
      <t>This document enables DNS initiators to send a main question accompanying with several related questions in a single DNS query, and enables DNS responders to put the answers into a single DNS response. This extension enables a range of initiators to look up "X, or failing that, Y" in a better way than both current alternatives. This mechanism can reduce the number of DNS round- trips per application work-unit.</t>
