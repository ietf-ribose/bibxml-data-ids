      <t>The present document focuses on the MPLS Fast Reroute many-to-one solution. It defines on the one hand, a specific PLR behavior for the dynamic setup of bypass LSPs, and on the other hand a distributed bypass LSP path computation mechanism, taking into account the possibility to share protection resources. It proposes ISIS-TE/OSPF-TE and RSVP-TE extensions required to support the described functionality.</t>
