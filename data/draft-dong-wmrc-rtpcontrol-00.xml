      <t>This document introduces a Wireless Channel Model Based rate controlscheme for improving the behavior of real time multimedia streamswith TFRC [2] in wireless-wired heterogeneous networks. Based onwireless channel characteristics, the method can first identify thelevel of packet losses of two different types by sending large andsmall packets alternately, then adopt different adaptive rate controlstrategies to increase the network throughput and decrease congestionpacket loss rate, to improve transmission quality of real-timemultimedia stream. The proposed method is compared with previouslyreported algorithms [3-4] by simulation. It is shown from thesimulation results in different network topology environments, theperformance the proposed algorithm is better than existing algorithmsin the aspects of network bandwidth utilization and congestion packetloss control. Parts of this method published in the IEEE WirelessCommunications and Networking Conference (WCNC2007) and in a pendingChina patent (access number: CN101686100).</t>
