    <abstract>
      <t>This document aims to present a set of SIP user requirements that support communications for deaf, hard of hearing and speech-impaired individuals. These user requirements address the current difficulties of deaf, hard of hearing and speech-impaired individuals in using communications facilities, while acknowledging the multi-functional potential of SIP-based communications. A number of issues related to these user requirements are further raised in this document. Also included are some real world scenarios and some technical requirements to show the robustness of these requirements on a concept-level.</t>
