      <t>RC4 is extremely weak as shown by RFC 6649 and RFC 7457, is prohibited in TLS by RFC 7465, is prohibited in Kerberos by RFC xxxx and it needs to be prohibited in all IETF protocols. This document obsoletes RFC 4345 "Improved Arcfour Modes for the Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol" (note Arcfour and RC4 are synonymous). RFC 3501, RFC 4253, RFC 6649 and RFC 6733 are updated to note the deprecation of RC4 in all IETF protocols.</t>
