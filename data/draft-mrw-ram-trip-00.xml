      <t>This document describes a mechanism for scalable, tiered Internetrouting, called TRIP. The goal of TRIP is to decrease the growthrate of the core Internet routing tables by increasing routeaggregation and constraining the propagation of multihoming andtraffic engineering routes.TRIP accomplishes this goal by defining separate routing domains foredge networks and transit networks. All current, non-TRIP-awarenetworks and nodes are considered part of the transit domain. Edgenetwork domains may be created by deploying TRIP at a domain-boundaryrouters or within IP (v4 or v6) endpoints.In addition to defining the basic TRIP mechanism, this documentdescribes an incremental deployment path that provides a means forendpoints in TRIP-enabled edge networks to talk directly to non-TRIP-aware end-points in transit domain. This is accomplished without theneed to advertise edge network prefixes in the global routing tablesor to create a separate global routing domain for edge networkprefixes.</t>
