    <abstract>
      <t>Implementers have recently expressed different views on what can appear in the Additional section in DNS responses. Proposals for adding functionality to the DNS protocol that rely on non-glue records in the Additional section rely on having a common understanding of the semantics of the Additional section. This document restates what has been said in other DNS standards, and does not update any of them.</t>
