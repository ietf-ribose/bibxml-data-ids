      <t>This document describes a protocol for ''globally-distributedtroubleshooting'' (GDT). GDT automates, where possible, the process ofproblem reporting and referral between customers and Internet ServiceProviders (ISPs), as well as between ISPs. GDT also provides anautomatic mechanism for periodic status reports, and allows an ISP tomake information (such as expected time to repair) on a current problemreadily accessible to those directly affected by it, without requiringhuman intervention.</t>
