      <t>This document describes a protocol for ''globally-distributed troubleshooting'' (GDT). GDT automates, where possible, the process of problem reporting and referral between customers and Internet Service Providers (ISPs), as well as between ISPs. GDT also provides an automatic mechanism for periodic status reports, and allows an ISP to make information (such as expected time to repair) on a current problem readily accessible to those directly affected by it, without requiring human intervention.</t>
