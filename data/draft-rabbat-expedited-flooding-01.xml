      <t>Optical transport networks require fast restoration mechanisms with tight time bounds in order to recover from resource failures in a timely manner. These failures may include fiber cuts, transponder failure and node failures. Time-bounded recovery is challenging in mesh-based transport networks with shared protection. This draft discusses some currently available mechanisms and their limitations, and explains the need for an expedited flooding mechanism to accomplish this objective. The draft also highlights some challenges, mitigating factors, and possible solutions in the implementation of an expedited flooding protocol.</t>
