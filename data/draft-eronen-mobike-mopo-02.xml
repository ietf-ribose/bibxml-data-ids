      <t>This document describes a mobility and multihoming extension to the IKEv2 protocol. The main purpose of this extension is to update the (outer) addresses associated with IKE and IPsec Security Associations. The extension also includes features that assist in selecting which addresses to use, and verify return routability during and after updates. It is also able to work together with NAT Traversal in some scenarios.</t>
