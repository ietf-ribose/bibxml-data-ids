      <t>This I-D presents all known attack vectors into or using BGP. The data is presented in "Attack Tree" format as published by Schneier [ATTACKTREE] and detailed by the CERT in "Attack Modeling for Information Security and Survivability" [MODELING]. Future security improvements to BGP (whether best practices or enhancements to the protocol) should consider the attacks outlined here when determining the relative security improvements such changes provide.</t>
