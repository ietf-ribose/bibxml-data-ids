      <t>LIN6 is a protocol supporting mobility and multi-homing in IPv6. LIN6introduces the node id, not the interface id, for each node. Each nodecan be identified by its node id no matter where the node is connectedand no matter how many interfaces the node has. In the IPv6 layer,64-bit node id called LIN6 ID is used while 128-bit node-id called LIN6generalized ID is used above the Transport layer. TCP connections andsecurity associations can be preserved even if the node moves to anothersubnet or the node changes the using interface in a multi-homingenvironment without modifying TCP or IPsec. In comparison with MobileIPv6, LIN6 has several advantages in terms of header overhead and faulttolerance.</t>
