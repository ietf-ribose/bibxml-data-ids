      <t>There is an increased interest of simple and scalable resourceprovisioning solution for Diffserv network. The Load Control PCN(LC-PCN) addresses the following issues:o Admission Control for real time data flows in stateless DiffservDomainso Flow Termination: Termination of flows in case of exceptionalevents, such as severe congestion after re-routing.Admission control in a Diffserv stateless domain can be performedusing two methods:o Admission Control based on data marking, whereby in congestionsituations the data packets are marked to notify the PCN-egress-node that a congestion occurred on a particular PCN-ingress-nodeto PCN-egress-node path.o Probing, whereby a probe packet is sent along the forwarding pathin a network to determine whether a flow can be admitted basedupon the current congestion state of the networkThe scheme provides the capability of controlling the traffic load inthe network without requiring signaling or any per-flow processing inthe PCN-interior-nodes. The complexity of Load Control is kept to aminimum to make implementation simple. LC-PCN can support theingress-egress-aggregate (i.e., trunk/pipe) bandwidth managementmodel as well as the HOSE bandwidth management model.</t>
