      <t>There is an increased interest of simple and scalable resource provisioning solution for Diffserv network. The Load Control PCN (LC-PCN) addresses the following issues: o Admission Control for real time data flows in stateless Diffserv Domains o Flow Termination: Termination of flows in case of exceptional events, such as severe congestion after re-routing. Admission control in a Diffserv stateless domain can be performed using two methods: o Admission Control based on data marking, whereby in congestion situations the data packets are marked to notify the PCN-egress- node that a congestion occurred on a particular PCN-ingress-node to PCN-egress-node path. o Probing, whereby a probe packet is sent along the forwarding path in a network to determine whether a flow can be admitted based upon the current congestion state of the network The scheme provides the capability of controlling the traffic load in the network without requiring signaling or any per-flow processing in the PCN-interior-nodes. The complexity of Load Control is kept to a minimum to make implementation simple. LC-PCN can support the ingress-egress-aggregate (i.e., trunk/pipe) bandwidth management model as well as the HOSE bandwidth management model.</t>
