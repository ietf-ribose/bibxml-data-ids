      <t>This document is derived from the architecture and detailed functions of SDAF. It is a network function to perform a security analysis and provide analysis results in a 5G system with a service-based architecture (SBA). To this end, the concept of SDAF, the structure of internalizing the 5G system, and the communication interface used by SDAF are defined. It also defines the use cases that can utilize SDAF. This standard is based on the service and operation requirements for a 5G system with SBA.</t>
