      <t>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) has beenextended with a Leasequery capability that allows a client to requestinformation about DHCPv6 bindings. That mechanism is limited toqueries for individual bindings. In some situations individualbinding queries may not be efficient, or even possible. Thisdocument specifies extensions to the Leasequery protocol that add newquery types and allow for bulk DHCPv6 binding data transfer.</t>
