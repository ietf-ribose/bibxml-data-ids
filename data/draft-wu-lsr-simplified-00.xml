    <abstract>
      <t>This distributed routing protocol aims to facilitate information exchange and path calculation between routers to ensure efficient data transmission in the network. Each router initializes adjacency matrices, neighbor tables, routing tables, and flood flags during setup. In operation, routers periodically broadcast Hello packets to update neighbor tables and detect changes in neighbor relationships, broadcasting update packets accordingly. Nodes receiving update packets process them based on flood flags, optimizing network performance through scheduled flood flag resets, controlling link occupancy rates, and utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm to compute shortest paths when adjacency matrices are complete, storing results in routing tables for optimal path selection.</t>
