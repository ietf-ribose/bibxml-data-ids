      <t>IEEE1394 bus is a link layer network with isochronous transfer modecapability. Therefore it is quite natural that there appearsfollowing demands. (1)Transmit specific IP flow through a certainisochronous channel of IEEE1394 bus. (2)Transmit specific AV flow(such as MPEG2-TS with CIP header[61883]) through a certainisochronous channel of IEEE1394 bus (and control these flows by IPapplications). To realize these, this draft proposes the protocolwith following features. (1)Notify the relation between channel IDand IP flow. (2)Notify the bandwidth of the isochronouschannel. (3)Notify the direction of the IP flow transmitted throughthe channel. (4)Notify the attribute of the flow. This protocol isdefined as the extension of MCAP (Multicast Channel AllocationProtocol).</t>
