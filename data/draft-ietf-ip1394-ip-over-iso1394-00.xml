    <abstract>
      <t>IEEE1394 bus is a link layer network with isochronous transfer mode capability. Therefore it is quite natural that there appears following demands. (1)Transmit specific IP flow through a certain isochronous channel of IEEE1394 bus. (2)Transmit specific AV flow (such as MPEG2-TS with CIP header[61883]) through a certain isochronous channel of IEEE1394 bus (and control these flows by IP applications). To realize these, this draft proposes the protocol with following features. (1)Notify the relation between channel ID and IP flow. (2)Notify the bandwidth of the isochronous channel. (3)Notify the direction of the IP flow transmitted through the channel. (4)Notify the attribute of the flow. This protocol is defined as the extension of MCAP (Multicast Channel Allocation Protocol).</t>
