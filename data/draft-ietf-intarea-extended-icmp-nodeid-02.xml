    <abstract>
      <t>RFC5837 describes a mechanism for Extending ICMP for Interface and Next-Hop Identification, which allows providing additional information in an ICMP error that helps identify interfaces participating in the path. This is especially useful in environments where a given interface may not have a unique IP address to respond to, e.g., a traceroute. This document introduces a similar ICMP extension for Node Identification. It allows providing a unique IP address and/or a textual name for the node, in the case where each node may not have a unique IP address (e.g., a deployment in which all interfaces have IPv6 addresses and all nexthops are IPv6 nexthops, even for IPv4 routes).</t>
