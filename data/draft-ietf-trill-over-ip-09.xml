    <abstract>
      <t>The TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol supports both point-to-point and multi-access links and is designed so that a variety of link protocols can be used between TRILL switch ports. This document specifies transmission of encapsulated TRILL data and TRILL IS-IS over IP (v4 or v6). so as to use an IP network as a TRILL link in a unified TRILL campus. The encapsulations specified herein are UDP based but provision is made to negotiate other encapsulations that need not be UDP based. This document updates RFC 7177 and updates RFC 7178.</t>
