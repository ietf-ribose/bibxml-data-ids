    <abstract>
      <t>This specification extends Message Layer Security (MLS) credentials framework with a new credential type, "UserInfoVC", based on the OpenID Connect UserInfo Verifiable Credential type "UserInfoCredential". A UserInfo Verifiable Credential encapsulates the UserInfo claims from the OpenID provider as a Verifiable Credential that can be presented to a third-party Verifier. These credentials can be easily provisioned to MLS clients using the OpenID Connect login flows, augmented with type "UserInfoCredential". The credential itself is an object associating identity attributes to the signature public key that the client will use in MLS, signed by the OpenID Provider. In situations where the OpenID Provider is distinct from the MLS Delivery Service, these credentials provide end-to-end secure identity assurance.</t>
