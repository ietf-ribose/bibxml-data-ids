      <t>AI Agents are rapidly evolving from academic concepts into the core engines driving next-generation applications. However, their autonomy, dynamic nature, and complex delegation relationships pose a fundamental challenge to our existing authentication and authorization frameworks, which were designed for human users and traditional software. This document dissects the novel characteristics of AI Agents and outlines the new requirements for authentication and authorization which can manage dynamic behavior rather than verifying static identity.</t>
