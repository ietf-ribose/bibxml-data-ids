    <abstract>
      <t>The existing Transport Network Aware Mobility for 5G [TN-AWARE- MOBILITY] draft specifies a framework for mapping the 5G mobile systems Slice and Service Types (SSTs) to corresponding underlying network paths in IP and Layer 2 Transport networks.The focus of that work is limited to the 3GPP domain (i.e., eNB &lt;-&gt; UPFs) and doesn't go beyond the UPF to the IP Data Network. To maintain the end-to-end transport network characteristics between UEs and their application servers, the framework needs to be extended to the data centers where the services are hosted. This document describes a framework for extending the mobility aware transport network characteristics from the UPF through the IP Data Networks.</t>
