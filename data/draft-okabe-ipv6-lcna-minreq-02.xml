      <t>Resource limitations and cost constraints associated with small-embedded devices make it difficult to implement the entire IPv6 specification. We call such non-PC embedded devices (e.g. game-machines, AV devices, sensors, digital cameras, LCD projectors, and home appliances) 'Low Cost Network Appliances', and define the IPv6 host requirements for them. In this document, we will also point out several items to be discussed for the deployment of IPv6 on LCNAs.</t>
