      <t>The practice and need for active network measurement is well established, however current tools are not well suited to this task, mostly because the protocols which they employ have not been designed for measurement of the modern Internet. The IP Measurement Protocol (IPMP) is based on packet-probes, and is designed to allow routers to participate in measurements by the insertion of path information as the probe passes between a pair of hosts.</t>
