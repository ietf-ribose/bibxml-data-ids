      <t>IP networks can support real-time text communication. SIP-basedreal- time text is called Text-over-IP or ToIP. PSTN networkssupport real-time text using textphones (or TTYs). When real-timetext is supported by different networks, gateways are needed toprovide interoperability. Real-time text capable gateways may alsosupport real-time voice.This specification describes procedures for interworking between ToIPand PSTN textphones using a real-time text capable gateway (RTTgateway). It also describes ways to route calls to RTT gateways forseveral call scenarios.Procedures that support the phased introduction of RTT gateways andprocedures that support the invocation of text channels at any timeduring the call are included. Interworking of PSTN textphones thatdo not support simultaneity of voice and text with IP User Agentsthat support simultaneous voice and text is also described.</t>
