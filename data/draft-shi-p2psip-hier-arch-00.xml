      <t>This document outlines the hierarchical P2P-SIP architecture, whichmakes the combination of P2P and SIP practical. In thisarchitecture, heterogeneous overlays are inter-connected via adecentralized manner provided by the hierarchical P2P-SIParchitecture. The overhead of the session control process is reducedsince the P2P overlay is used by SIP as the underlying peer locatingapproach. Some nodes in the overlay are proposed to be stateful toimprove the reliability of the overlay. Finally, a session initialexample is presented to illustrate this architecture.This work isbeing discussed on the p2psip@cs.columbia.edu mailing list.</t>
