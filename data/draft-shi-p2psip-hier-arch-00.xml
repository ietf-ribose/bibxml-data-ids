      <t>This document outlines the hierarchical P2P-SIP architecture, which makes the combination of P2P and SIP practical. In this architecture, heterogeneous overlays are inter-connected via a decentralized manner provided by the hierarchical P2P-SIP architecture. The overhead of the session control process is reduced since the P2P overlay is used by SIP as the underlying peer locating approach. Some nodes in the overlay are proposed to be stateful to improve the reliability of the overlay. Finally, a session initial example is presented to illustrate this architecture.This work is being discussed on the p2psip@cs.columbia.edu mailing list.</t>
