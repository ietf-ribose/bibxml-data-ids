    <abstract>
      <t>Massive pervasive monitoring attacks using key exfiltration and made possible by key exchange without forward secrecy have been reported. If key exchange without Diffie-Hellman is used, static exfiltration of the long-term authentication keys enables passive attackers to compromise all past and future connections. Malicious actors can get access to long-term keys in different ways: physical attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks, espionage, or by simply demanding access to keying material with or without a court order. Exfiltration attacks are a major cybersecurity threat. The use of psk_ke is not following zero trust principles of minimizing the impact of breach and governments have already made deadlines for its deprecation. This document updates the IANA PskKeyExchangeMode registry by setting the "Recommended" value for psk_ke to "N".</t>
