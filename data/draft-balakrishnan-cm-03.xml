      <t>This document describes the Congestion Manager (CM), an end-system module that (i) enables an ensemble of multiple concurrent flows from a sender destined to the same receiver and sharing the same congestion properties to perform proper congestion avoidance and control, and (ii) allows applications to easily adapt to network congestion. This CM framework integrates congestion management across all applications and transport protocols. The CM maintains congestion parameters (available aggregate and per-flow bandwidth, per-receiver round-trip times, etc.) and exports an API that enables applications to learn about network characteristics, pass information to the CM, share congestion information with each other, and schedule data transmissions. This document focuses on applications and transport protocols with their own independent per-byte or per-packet sequence number information, and does not require modifications to the receiver protocol stack. The receiving application must provide feedback to the sending application about received packets and losses, and the latter uses the CM API to update CM state. This document does not address networks with reservations or service discrimination.</t>
