      <t>This document describes the Congestion Manager (CM), an end-systemmodule that (i) enables an ensemble of multiple concurrent flowsfrom a sender destined to the same receiver and sharing the samecongestion properties to perform proper congestion avoidance andcontrol, and (ii) allows applications to easily adapt to networkcongestion. This CM framework integrates congestion managementacross all applications and transport protocols. The CM maintainscongestion parameters (available aggregate and per-flow bandwidth,per-receiver round-trip times, etc.) and exports an API thatenables applications to learn about network characteristics, passinformation to the CM, share congestion information with eachother, and schedule data transmissions. This document focuses onapplications and transport protocols with their own independentper-byte or per-packet sequence number information, and does notrequire modifications to the receiver protocol stack. Thereceiving application must provide feedback to the sendingapplication about received packets and losses, and the latter usesthe CM API to update CM state. This document does not addressnetworks with reservations or service discrimination.</t>
