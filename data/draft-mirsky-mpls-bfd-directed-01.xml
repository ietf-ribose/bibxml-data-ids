    <abstract>
      <t>Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) is expected to monitor bi- directional paths. When a BFD session monitors in its forward direction an explicitly routed path there is a need to be able to direct far-end BFD peer to use specific path as reverse direction of the BFD session.</t>
