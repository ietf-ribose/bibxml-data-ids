      <t>This document specifies an encapsulation method for mobile-IP which enables intermediate systems to initiate routing optimization process. Key mechanism is to concatenation IP header as an outer IP header instead of IP tunneling specified as protocol number 4 in [1]. This datagram is called IP2 (IP squared) datagram. In order to handle the datagram, it is required for every mobility supporting node to have two functionalities, which discriminate whether received datagram is IP or IP2 datagrams and decide which datagram format should be used as transmitting datagram IP or IP2. These functionalities enable an intermediate mobility support node to initiate routing optimization process in [2] and routing paths between mobile and conventional stationary nodes can be optimized in the result.</t>
