      <t>Firewall and Service Tickets is a generic and extensible protocol mechanism for hosts to send explicit signals to on-path elements to request network services on a per packet basis. This is a type of "host to networks signaling", and the data of the signal is a "ticket" that accompanies a packet. A ticket indicates the requested services or a grant of admission into a network; tickets are processed by network nodes to instantiate the requested services. Tickets are scoped to be relevant to their "origin domain" which is the network or limited domain in which they are issued. Outside of their origin domain tickets are not processed and are forwarded as opaque data. To prevent forgery and to obscure the services being requested, tickets are authenticated, encrypted, or otherwise obfuscated such that they can only be read by network nodes in their origin domain. Tickets are sent in IPv6 Hop-by-Hop options.</t>
