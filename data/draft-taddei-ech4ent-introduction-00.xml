    <abstract>
      <t>This paper reviews some of the Enterprises and Organizations requirements and constraints and tests the current Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) proposal in these environments. In particular it highlights the need for several clarifications as well as highlights known attack vectors which will become easier with the current ECH proposal. The current ECH drafts should consider how they want to include enterprises operational security capabilities to mitigate these attacks.</t>
