      <t>This document captures problems and issues discovered at SCTP bakeoff's and on the sigtran mailing list. This document will be updated after each bakeoff augmenting the existing draft to include any new issues discovered during inter-operability testing. Two basic sets of problems are identified by this draft: first, issues that need to be addressed when the next revision of SCTP is created, i.e. issues that should be remembered in a BIS document; second, issues that were found that are strictly implementation problems.</t>
