    <abstract>
      <t>It has become accepted that packets containing IPv6 Extension Headers, especially Hop-by-hop Options, are frequently dropped on the Internet. However, the question still remains as to why they get dropped and what type of devices may be dropping them. This document describes research conducted to isolate routers in a simple topology, with minimal configuration, and shows that router implementations alone are likely not the cause of packets containing IPv6 Extension Headers being dropped on the Internet.</t>
