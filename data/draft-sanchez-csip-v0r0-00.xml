      <t>This document describes CSIP, a protocol architecture that provides thesupport of TCAP user applications over an IP network. The core part ofthe CSIP architecture is the specification of the CSIP (ConnectionlessSCCP over IP) adaptation layer, that provides adaptation between theSCCP layer already defined in [2] and the IP family protocols IP, UDP,TCP and ICMP. UDP is used when SCCP class 0 is used, TCP is usedwhen SCCP class 1 is used. CSIP provides the primitives and parametersto SCCP than MTP, and provides backward compatibility that guaranteesthe seamless connection between nodes implementing CSIP and classicalSS7 nodes by means of a CSIP gateway. The design of CSIP is oriented tofulfill the requirements of TCAP user applications running on a WAN.</t>
