      <t>This document describes CSIP, a protocol architecture that provides the support of TCAP user applications over an IP network. The core part of the CSIP architecture is the specification of the CSIP (Connectionless SCCP over IP) adaptation layer, that provides adaptation between the SCCP layer already defined in [2] and the IP family protocols IP, UDP, TCP and ICMP. UDP is used when SCCP class 0 is used, TCP is used when SCCP class 1 is used. CSIP provides the primitives and parameters to SCCP than MTP, and provides backward compatibility that guarantees the seamless connection between nodes implementing CSIP and classical SS7 nodes by means of a CSIP gateway. The design of CSIP is oriented to fulfill the requirements of TCAP user applications running on a WAN.</t>
