      <t>Segment Routing architecture supports the use of multiple routing algorithms, i.e, different constraint-based shortest-path calculations can be supported. There are two standard algorithms: SPF and Strict-SPF, defined in Segment Routing architecture. There are also other user defined algorithms according to Flex-algo applicaiton. However, an algorithm identifier is often included as part of a Prefix-SID advertisement, that maybe not satisfy some scenarios where multiple algorithm share the same link resource. This document complement that the algorithm identifier can be also included as part of a Adjacency-SID advertisement</t>
