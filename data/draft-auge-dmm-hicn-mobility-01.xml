    <abstract>
      <t>This document first dicusses the use of locators and identifiers in mobility management architectures, and their implication on various anchorless properties. A new architecture is then proposed that is purely based on identifiers, and more specifically names as defined in Hybrid-ICN [I-D.muscariello-intarea-hicn]. The document then focuses on two main cases: the end-point sends data (data producer) or the end-point receive data (data consumer). These two cases are taken into account entirely to provide anchorless mobility management in hICN.</t>
