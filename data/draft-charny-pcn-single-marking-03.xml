      <t>Pre-Congestion Notification described in[I-D.eardley-pcn-architecture] and earlier in[I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture] approach proposes the use of anAdmission Control mechanism to limit the amount of real-time PCNtraffic to a configured level during the normal operating conditions,and the use of a Flow Termination mechanism to tear-down some of theflows to bring the PCN traffic level down to a desirable amountduring unexpected events such as network failures, with the goal ofmaintaining the QoS assurances to the remaining flows. In[I-D.eardley-pcn-architecture], Admission and Flow Termination usetwo different markings and two different metering mechanisms in theinternal nodes of the PCN region. This draft proposes a mechanismusing a single marking and metering for both Admission and FlowTermination, and presents an analysis of the tradeoffs. A side-effect of this proposal is that a different marking and meteringAdmission mechanism than that proposed in[I-D.eardley-pcn-architecture] may be also feasible, and may resultin a number of benefits. In addition, this draft proposes amigration path for incremental deployment of this approach as anintermediate step to the dual-marking approach.</t>
