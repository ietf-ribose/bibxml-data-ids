      <t>This proposal describes a mechanism that can be used to detect Data Path Failures of various overlay technologies as VXLAN, NVGRE, MPLSoGRE and MPLSoUDP and verifying/sanity of their Control and Data Plane for given Overlay Segment. This document defines the following for each of the above Overlay Technologies: o Encapsulation of OAM Packet, such that it has same Outer and Overlay Header as any End-System's data going over the same Overlay Segment. o The mechanism to trace the Underlay that is exercised by any Overlay Segment. o Procedure to verify presence of any given Tenant VM or End-System within a given Overlay Segment at Overlay End-Point. Even though the present proposal addresses Overlay OAM for VXLAN, NVGRE, MPLSoGRE and MPLSoUDP, but the procedures described are generic enough to accommodate OAM for any other Overlay Technology.</t>
