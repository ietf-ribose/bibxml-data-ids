      <t>A new 'path' URN scheme is proposed that defines a uniformly hierarchical name space. This URN scheme supports dynamic relocation and replication of resources. Existing DNS technology is used to resolve a path into sets of equivalent URLs, and then one URL is resolved into the named resource.</t>
