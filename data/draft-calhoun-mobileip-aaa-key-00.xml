      <t>AAA servers, such as RADIUS and DIAMETER, are in use within the Internet today to provide authentication and authorization services for dial-up computers. Mobile IP requires strong authentication between the mobile node and its home agent. When the mobile node shares a security association with its home AAA server, however, it is possible to use that security association to create derivative security associations between the mobile node and its home agent, and again between the mobile node and the foreign agent currently offering a care-of address to the mobile node. This document specifies extensions to the Mobile IP Registration Reply packet that can be used to distribute such security information to the mobile node.</t>
