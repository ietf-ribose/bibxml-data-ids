      <t>Virtualization provides Data Center with feasibility and improves theutilization of limited physical resource, e.g. switches/routers,servers and links. Virtual machines (VM) are allowed to migrate toany place in the Data Center. A variety of policies (e.g. ACL,firewalls, load balancers, IPS and QoS) are deployed in Data Centerto guarantee the SLA the provider signed with their clients. Dynamicinformation, such as TCP Connection Table, dynamic ACLs and cumulateddata, is generated on network devices. In order to keep runningservices uninterrupted while VM migrating, relevant policies anddynamic information, also need to migrate with VM.This document describes some examples of the policies and dynamicinformation that need to migrate with VM, the influence if they arenot migrated with VM, the problems that need to consider when migratepolices and dynamic information. It also describes some existingnetwork management protocols standardized by IETF and the advantagesand disadvantages of them for operating policies and dynamicinformation migration respectively. The goal is to justify that itis necessary for IETF to make effort on policy and dynamicinformation migration for large virtualized Data Center.</t>
