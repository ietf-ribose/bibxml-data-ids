      <t>Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks offer higher robustness against failure,easier configuration and are generally more economical than theirclient-server counterparts. It has therefore become reasonable forresource consuming and typically centralized applications like Voiceover IP (VoIP) and, in general, realtime communication to adapt andexploit the benefits of P2P. Such a migration needs to address a newset of P2P specific security problems. This document describes someof the known issues found in common P2P networks, analyzing therelevance of such issues and the applicability of existing solutionswhen using P2P architectures for realtime communication.</t>
