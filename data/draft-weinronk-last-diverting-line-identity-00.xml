      <t>This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). In cases where applications/services (for example verification / billing) are provided by a network that is not the originating network the Network Asserted Identity is needed to provide these services. This extension provides the ability for a 'diversion service' to provide a Network Asserted Identity of the last diverting user to these applications/services. This extension defines a new general header, Last Diverting Line Identity which conveys the Network Asserted Identity of the diverting party to these applications/services.</t>
