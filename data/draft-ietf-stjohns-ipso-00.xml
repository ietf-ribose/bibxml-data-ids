      <t>This document is a direct descendent of RFC1038 and RFC1108 and is a close cousin to the work done in the Commercial IP Security Option (CIPSO) Working Group of the Trusted Systems Interoperability Group. The original IP Security options defined by 1038 and 1108 were designed with one specific purpose in mind - to support the fielding of an IP packet encryption device called a BLACKER. Because of this, the definitions and assumptions in those documents were necessarily US Department of Defense and BLACKER centric. This document is meant to serve a larger community, while still meeting the needs of the 1038/1108 audience.</t>
