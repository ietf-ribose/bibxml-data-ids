      <t>We present our work on efficient scalable solutions to the hierarchical key management and distribution problem for secure multicast sessions. We take two rooted-tree based schemes that solve hierarchical key management and distribution problem and then present ways of making these schemes more efficient by reducing the tree center key storage with an upper bound on key update communication. The objective of improving efficiency is posed as a constrained optimization problem, which we further reduce to a fixed-point equation and find solutions. We also provide a tree design algorithm, which allows the designer to specify an upper key update communication bound and construct an efficient tree with minimal center storage while maintaining pre- existing logarithmic scalability in time and space requirements. The choice of update communication bound as a design factor is the recent development of multicast communication applications, which have energy or bandwidth as constraints, and these in turn being directly related to communication bounds.</t>
