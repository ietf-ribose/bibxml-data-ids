      <t>This document defines a new function for the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API), which allows applications to store delegated (and other) credentials in the implicit GSS-API credential store. This is needed for GSS-API applications to use delegated credentials as they would use other credentials. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
