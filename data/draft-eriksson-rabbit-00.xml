      <t>This document identifies and categorizes the components of routing, switching, forwarding, and addressing that may be used in routing architectures. The intention is to support the development of a new routing architecture for the Internet. The addressing architecture, address allocation and assignment principles, and possibilities for renumbering are important aspects when designing a routing architecture. How routing information is learned and methods for distributing it are other issues discussed in this document. A number of methods for data traffic forwarding are also described and evaluated</t>
