      <t>This document identifies and categorizes the components of routing,switching, forwarding, and addressing that may be used in routingarchitectures. The intention is to support the development of a newrouting architecture for the Internet.The addressing architecture, address allocation and assignmentprinciples, and possibilities for renumbering are important aspectswhen designing a routing architecture. How routing information islearned and methods for distributing it are other issues discussed inthis document. A number of methods for data traffic forwarding arealso described and evaluated</t>
