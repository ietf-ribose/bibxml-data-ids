      <t>JMAP ([RFC8620] - JSON Meta Application Protocol) is a generic protocol for synchronising data, such as mail, calendars or contacts, between a client and a server. It is optimised for mobile and web environments, and aims to provide a consistent interface to different data types. JMAP for Mail ([RFC8621] - The JSON Meta Application Protocol (JMAP) for Mail) specifies a data model for synchronising email data with a server using JMAP. Clients can use this to efficiently search, access, organise, and send messages. MDN are defined in [RFC8098] and are used as "read receipts", "acknowledgements", or "receipt notifications". MDN have a specific format that must be parsed or generated. The goal of this document is to specify a data model for handling MDN messages with a server using JMAP.</t>
