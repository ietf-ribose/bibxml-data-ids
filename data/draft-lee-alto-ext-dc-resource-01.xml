      <t>In a networked application environment where resources (e.g., computing, storage, etc.) are geographically distributed in Data Centers, a key decision is to allocate the application request to an "optimal" Data Center location in which to host the application request. Key constraints in this decision include resource availability, network cost, infrastructure constraints (e.g., power) and others. This draft proposes an ALTO extension to support data center resource information model and its related protocol extensions.</t>
