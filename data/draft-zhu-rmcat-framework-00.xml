      <t>Congestion control is an essential element in ensuring fair bandwidth usage and preventing congestion collapse for traffic sharing the Internet. For interactive real-time media traffic such as video conferencing, design of congestion control solution also needs to account for many other factors such as the requirement for low latency packet delivery and interactions with live video encoder. This document describes a common framework with the core functional building blocks for a real-time media congestion solutions.</t>
