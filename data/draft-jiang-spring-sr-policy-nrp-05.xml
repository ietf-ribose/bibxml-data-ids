    <abstract>
      <t>Segment Routing (SR) Policy is a set of candidate paths, each consisting of one or more segment lists and the associated information. A Network Resource Partition (NRP), is a subset of the resources and associated policies in the underlay network. In SR networks with multiple NRPs, an SR Policy can be associated with a particular NRP. In that case, SR Policy can be used for steering and forwarding traffic which is mapped to the NRP, so that the packets can be processed with the subset of network resources and policy of the NRP for guaranteed performance. Thus the association between SR Policy and NRP needs to be specified. This document defines extensions to the SR Policy Architecture to allow the association of the SR Policy candidate paths with NRPs.</t>
