      <t>This document specifies the information contained in a database of long-lived cryptographic keys used by many different security protocols. The database design supports both manual and automated key management. In many instances, the security protocols do not directly use the long-lived key, but rather a key derivation function is used to derive a short-lived key from a long-lived key.</t>
