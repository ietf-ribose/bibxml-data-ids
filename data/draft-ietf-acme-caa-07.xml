      <t>The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS record allows a domain to communicate issuance policy to Certification Authorities (CAs), but only allows a domain to define policy with CA-level granularity. However, the CAA specification also provides facilities for extension to admit more granular, CA-specific policy. This specification defines two such parameters, one allowing specific accounts of a CA to be identified by URI and one allowing specific methods of domain control validation as defined by the ACME protocol to be required.</t>
