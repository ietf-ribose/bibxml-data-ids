      <t>This document is one of a set of documents which together describe all aspects of a new Internet Printing Protocol (IPP). IPP is an application level protocol that can be used for distributed printing using Internet tools and technology. The protocol is heavily influenced by the printing model introduced in the Document Printing Application (ISO/IEC 10175 DPA) standard.

Although DPA specifies both end user and administrative features, IPP version 1.0 is focused only on end user functionality.</t>
