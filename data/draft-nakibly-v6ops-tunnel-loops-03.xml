      <t>This document is concerned with security vulnerabilities in IPv6-in-IPv4 automatic tunnels. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker totake advantage of inconsistencies between a tunnel's overlay IPv6routing state and the native IPv6 routing state. The attack forms arouting loop which can be abused as a vehicle for trafficamplification to facilitate DoS attacks. The first aim of thisdocument is to inform on this attack and its root causes. The secondaim is to present some possible mitigation measures.</t>
