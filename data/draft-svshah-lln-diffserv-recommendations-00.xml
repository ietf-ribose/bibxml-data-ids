      <t>Differentiated services architecture is widely deployed in traditional networks. There exist well defined recommendations for the use of appropriate differentiated service classes for different types of traffic (eg. audio, video) in these networks. Per-Hop Behaviors are typically defined based on this recommendations. With emerging Low-power and Lossy Networks (LLNs), traffic originated in a LLN, such as metering, command and control, may transit over a converged campus IP network, or even a Wide Area Network, and will share resources with traditional classes of traffic such as voice, video and data. It is important to have defined differentiated services recommendations for LLN traffic to co-exist with traditional class of traffic.</t>
