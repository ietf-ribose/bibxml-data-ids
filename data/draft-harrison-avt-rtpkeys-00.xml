      <t>[Note: This draft is preliminary and is believed to contain errors and omissions.] This memo describes an RTP payload format (KS) which transports cryptographic key information for encrypted media streams. The media streams themselves are transported independently, and may or may not be carried by RTP. The KS payload format makes particular provision for media carried by SRTP [4]. The payload carried over KS contains the information necessary for seamlessly applying new decryption keys during an active session, by means of byte-granularity pointers referencing into the protected stream. The KS payload is based on CMS [2] and is scalable to a wide variety of streaming media</t>
