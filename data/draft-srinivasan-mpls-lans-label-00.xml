    <abstract>
      <t>Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) refers to a forwarding paradigm for routed networks which combines the speed and simplicity of link layer switching with the scalability and control of network layer forwarding. Routers which support MPLS are referred to as Label Switching Routers (LSRs). MPLS requires the distribution labels between peer LSRs based on routing and traffic information. These labels are then carried in packets and are used for making high speed forwarding decisions at the routers by eliminating the need for conventional network layer header processing. This note discusses the format and encapsulation of labels when using MPLS on LAN media.</t>
