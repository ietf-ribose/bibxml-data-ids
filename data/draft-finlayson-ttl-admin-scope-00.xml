      <t>The use of 'administratively scoped' multicast address ranges (as described in [1]) leads to a multicast traffic scoping mechanism that is superior to the original 'TTL scoping' mechanism. Contrary to popular opinion, however, administrative (often abbreviated as 'admin') scoping does not truly *replace* TTL scoping. In particular, multicast-based applications must still be aware of which TTL value(s) they use. In this document, we note that each definition of a range of admin scoped multicast addresses should be accompanied by a corresponding 'maximum effective TTL' that should be used with these addresses. We describe how these TTL values are used by applications, and how they may influence the configuration of multicast border routers.</t>
