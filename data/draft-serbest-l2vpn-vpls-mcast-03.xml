      <t>In Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), the PE devices provide a logical interconnect such that CE devices belonging to a specific VPLS instance appear to be connected by a single LAN. A VPLS solution performs replication for multicast traffic at the ingress PE devices. When replicated at the ingress PE, multicast traffic wastes bandwidth when 1. Multicast traffic is sent to sites with no members, and 2. Pseudo wires to different sites go through a shared path. This document is addressing the former by IGMP and PIM snooping.</t>
