    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines enhancements to Bootstrapping a Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) [RFC8995] to enable bootstrapping in domains featuring no or only limited connectivity between a pledge and the domain registrar. It specifically changes the interaction model from a pledge-initiated mode, as used in BRSKI, to a pledge- responding mode, where the pledge is in server role. For this, BRSKI with Pledge in Responder Mode (BRSKI-PRM) introduces a new component, the registrar-agent, which facilitates the communication between pledge and registrar during the bootstrapping phase. To establish the trust relation between pledge and registrar, BRSKI-PRM relies on object security rather than transport security. The approach defined here is agnostic to the enrollment protocol that connects the domain registrar to the domain CA.</t>
