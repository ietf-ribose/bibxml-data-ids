    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an mechanism for a standard, programmatic interface for address pool management. With the remaining IPv4 address becoming more and more scattered, it is complicated to manually configure the address pools on lots of Broadband Network Gateways(BNGs) for operators. By introducing SDN/NFV in BNG, the address pools can be allocated in a centralized way. It will not only simplify the address management for operators, but also improve the utilization efficiency of the address pool.</t>
