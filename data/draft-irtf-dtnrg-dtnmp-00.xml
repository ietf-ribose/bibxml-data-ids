      <t>This draft describes the Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network Management Protocol (DTNMP). The DTNMP provides monitoring and configuration features between managing devices and those managed devices operating on the far side of high-delay or high-disruption links. The protocol is designed to minimize the number of transmitted bytes, operate without sessions or (concurrent) two-way links, and to function autonomously when there is no timely contact with a network operator.</t>
