      <t>This document describes and recommends methods by which peer-to-peer(P2P) applications can operate efficiently in the presence of NetworkAddress Translation (NAT). This document also providesrecommendations for the design of network address translators, inorder for them to support P2P applications effectively withoutcompromising security or performance. This memo focuses on theinteraction of P2P with NAT in the absence of any special proxy,gateway, or relaying protocols. While not intending to preclude theuse of such protocols, the goal of this memo is to enable P2Papplications to function automatically without specific knowledge ofthe type, location, or configuration of the NAT.</t>
