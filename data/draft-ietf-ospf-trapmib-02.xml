      <t>OSPF is an event driven routing protocol, where an event can be a change in an OSPF interface's link-level status, the expiration of an OSPF timer or the reception of an OSPF protocol packet. Many of the actions that OSPF takes as a result of these events will result in a change of the routing topology. As routing topologies become large and complex it is often difficult to locate the source of a topology change or unpredicted routing path by polling a large number or routers. Another approach is to notify a network manager of potentially critical OSPF events with SNMP traps. This draft document defines a set of traps, objects and mechanisms to enhance the ability to manage IP internetworks which use OSPF as its IGP. It is meant as an extension to the OSPF MIB.</t>
