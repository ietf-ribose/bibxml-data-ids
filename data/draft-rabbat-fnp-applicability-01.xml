      <t>The Fault Notification Protocol (FNP) is a set of procedures designedto enable time-bounded failure notification in networks using an IP-based control plane. This document discusses the applicability of FNPin the context of optical transport networks. It highlights theprotocol?s principles of operation, and then describes the network,node, fault, and operational models in optical networks for which theprotocol is designed. It also discusses the relationship to higherlayers, and issues of scalability. Some guidelines for deployment arealso provided.</t>
