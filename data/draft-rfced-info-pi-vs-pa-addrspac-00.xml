      <t>One can currently distinguish two kinds of globally unique, unicast IPv4 addresses: provider independent (PI) and provider aggregatable (PA) addresses. These addresses are assigned to end-users by Internet Registries (IRs). There are also non globally unique e.g. private unicast addresses as described in RFC1597 which are suitable for many applications.</t>
