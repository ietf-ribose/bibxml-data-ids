      <t>This document tries to address an approach for reorganization of entire network in a large address space. It describes how a three- tier mesh structured hierarchy can be established based on fragmenting the entire space into some regions and sub regions inside each of them. It addresses issues which could be relevant to this architecture in the context of IPv6. This document also tries to come out with an approach how IP switch based network can perform as good as ATM network for the processing of real time traffic.</t>
