      <t>When a correspondent node (CN) initiates a session with a multi-homed Mobile Node (MN), it should choose the "best" destination address based on the available information about the MN. Presently there is no mechanism allowing the MN to indicate on which interface (i.e., address) a CN may reach it. This draft documents a method whereby the MN may communicate to the CN address selection preferences so that the CN may initiate a session to the desired address (interface) for of the MN. The method is based on the notion of storing address selection preference information for the MN in the DNS.</t>
