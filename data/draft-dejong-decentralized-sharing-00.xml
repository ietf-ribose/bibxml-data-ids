      <t>This draft describes the steps and challenges of sharing documentsbetween persons, using internet-connected servers. We investigate thesituation where a document exists on a server to which the sender hasaccess through some software application, but the recipient(s) don't.All recipient(s) do, however, have access to software applications thatrun on least one other server.We discuss existing and proposed methods for the sender to initiate thecommunication, for each recipient to become aware of the sender's intentto share a document, for each recipient to access the document directly,for the document contents to be transmitted to server(s) to which therecipient(s) have access, for the sender to make and announce changes inthe document after it was initially sent, and for the recipient(s) tocommunicate comments and proposed changes to the document back to thesender.We also discuss how semantics of the document may be communicated,and how versioning conflicts may then in some cases be resolvedprogrammatically. Given that users of personal servers don't all runthe same compatible software on their server, the sending applicationneeds to discover which application-level protocols are supported by thereceiving application(s).</t>
