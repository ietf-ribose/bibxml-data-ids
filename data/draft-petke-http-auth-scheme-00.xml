      <t>Remote Passphrase Authentication provides a way to authenticate a user to a service by using a pass phrase over an insecure network, without revealing the pass phrase to eavesdroppers. In addition, the service need not know and does not learn the user's pass phrase, making this scheme useful in distributed environments where it would be difficult or inappropriate to trust a service with a pass phrase database or to allow the server to learn enough to masquerade as the user in a future authentication attempt. This draft is part three of a four part series and explains how to incorporate the RPA mechanism into HTTP. Part one of this series (draft-petke-ext-intro-00.txt) provides an extended introduction to the problems of authentication over insecure networks. Part two (draft-petke-mech-00.txt) explains the RPA mechanism. Part four (draft-petke-serv-deity-protocol-00.txt) explains the protocol between the service and deity. This scheme was inspired by Dave Raggett's Mediated Digest Authentication paper.</t>
