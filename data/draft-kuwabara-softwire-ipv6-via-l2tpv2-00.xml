      <t>This memo covers two topics: a brief summary of NTT Communications'commercial IPv6 service named "OCN IPv6", and a digest of thearchitecture, which includs the user network interface specificationand some service specific parameters, of the service.For NTT Communications' commercial IPv6 access service, IPv6 tunnelis created over the exiting IPv4 network by Layer two tunnelingprotocol [RFC2661]. By using L2TP, almost all the problems, which isdescribed in Softwire Problem Statement [I-D. ietf-softwire-problem-statement] , is solved. The NTT Communications service and thearchitecture is one of a commercial grade solution example forsoftwire problem statement.</t>
