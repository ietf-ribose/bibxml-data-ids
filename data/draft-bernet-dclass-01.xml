      <t>RSVP signaling may be used to enhance the manageability ofapplication traffic's QoS in a differentiated service (diff-serv)network [intdiff]. In this model, certain network elements within orat the edges of the diff-serv network may use RSVP messages toeffect admission control or to apply QoS policy. One mechanism bywhich network elements may apply QoS policy is by causing a DCLASSobject to be returned to a sending host in an RSVP RESV message. TheDCLASS object indicates the diff-serv DSCP that the sender shouldinclude when submitting packets on the admitted flow, to the diff-serv network. This draft describes the usage and format of theDCLASS object.</t>
