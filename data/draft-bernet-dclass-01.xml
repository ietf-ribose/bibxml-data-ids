      <t>RSVP signaling may be used to enhance the manageability of application traffic's QoS in a differentiated service (diff-serv) network [intdiff]. In this model, certain network elements within or at the edges of the diff-serv network may use RSVP messages to effect admission control or to apply QoS policy. One mechanism by which network elements may apply QoS policy is by causing a DCLASS object to be returned to a sending host in an RSVP RESV message. The DCLASS object indicates the diff-serv DSCP that the sender should include when submitting packets on the admitted flow, to the diff- serv network. This draft describes the usage and format of the DCLASS object.</t>
