      <t>The NFS (Network File System) version 4[rfc3530] (NFSv4) specifies a flavor of Access Control Lists (ACLs) that apply to file system objects. ACLs specify an access level for a number of entities. The NFSv4 ACLs model resembles that of Windows NT. A POSIX draft[posixacl] proposes another, more restrictive ACL model. Many systems implement this proposed standard. Differing in syntax, semantics and extensiveness, it is only feasible to create a correct representation for POSIX ACLs with NFSv4 ACLs. This does not hold for an attempt to represent arbitrary NFSv4 ACLs with POSIX ACLs.</t>
