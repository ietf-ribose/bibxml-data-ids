      <t>Service Provider requirements for support of DiffServ aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-DS-TE) are presented in [MPLS-DS-TE-REQ]. This initiative includes the definition of MPLS-DiffServ-TE class types (CTs), wherein CTs are defined as aggregations of individual service classes. Instead of having per-class parameters being configured and propagated on each LSR interface, classes are aggregated into CTs having common per-CT parameters (e.g., minimum bandwidth) to satisfy required performance levels, however, no bandwidth requirements are enforced for classes within a CT. The main motivation for grouping a set of classes into a CT is to improve the scalability of IGP LSAs by propagating information on a per-CT basis instead of on a per-class basis, and also to allow better bandwidth sharing between classes in the same CT. In order to further improve scalability through the introduction of CTs, we propose to a) limit the number of CTs to 6, and b) to generalize the notion of CTs and consider them to be a combination of i) DiffServ/queuing priority per-hop-behaviors (PHBs), ii) QoS classes (e.g., as specified in [Y.1541]), iii) admission-control priority classes, and iv) restoration priority classes at both the MPLS-LSP and transport link level.</t>
