      <t>Header Compression has proven to be essential for using RTP overbandwidth limited links. While all of these links have only alimited bandwidth, some are additional extremely unreliable, e.g.wireless links. It is shown, that existing Header Compressionschemes, that work well over reliable links, perform very bad, ifmany errors occur.This led to the development of a new robust Header Compressionmechanism, that is introduced in this paper. The core idea is thedefinition of update packets, which are referenced by non-updatepackets. This reduces the interdependency between the packets andwith this the amount of discarded packets at the decompressor.The Header Compression scheme, the used packet formats and thedecompression algorithm, are described in detail.</t>
