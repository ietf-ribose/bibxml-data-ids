      <t>Header Compression has proven to be essential for using RTP over bandwidth limited links. While all of these links have only a limited bandwidth, some are additional extremely unreliable, e.g. wireless links. It is shown, that existing Header Compression schemes, that work well over reliable links, perform very bad, if many errors occur. This led to the development of a new robust Header Compression mechanism, that is introduced in this paper. The core idea is the definition of update packets, which are referenced by non-update packets. This reduces the interdependency between the packets and with this the amount of discarded packets at the decompressor. The Header Compression scheme, the used packet formats and the decompression algorithm, are described in detail.</t>
