    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a set of network-related problems enterprises face when interconnecting their branch offices with dynamic workloads in third-party data centers (DCs) (a.k.a. Cloud DCs). These challenges are particularly relevant to enterprises with conventional VPN services that want to leverage those networks (instead of altogether abandoning them). The document also outlines various mitigation approaches, including those already developed within the IETF. For challenges that do not yet have established solutions, it identifies the IETF drafts that have been proposed to address these issues. The intent is to provide a cohesive view of problems and solution approaches that have been documented or proposed within the IETF.</t>
