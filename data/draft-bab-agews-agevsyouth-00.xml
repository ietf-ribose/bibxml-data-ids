    <abstract>
      <t>Solely technical measures advertised to allow for the age verification of minors online face fundamental challenges on a conceptual and implementation level. Organizational measures, on the other hand, have been established as best practices by peer groups who are both high risk and digitally savvy, which exists to protect minors. These approaches can be strengthened via technical measures, and two such candidates are the Qualified Website Authentication Certificates (QWACS), introduced by the EU as part of eIDAS 2.0 [QWACS] and potentially the work of IETF's digital emblems working group [DIEM]. Based on early analysis of the use and abuse cases as well as privacy and security considerations, we provide arguments why non-scaling organizational measures are a necessity and strengthening these with technical measures is a way to enable the security for minors online.</t>
