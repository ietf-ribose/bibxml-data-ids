    <abstract>
      <t>Many video applications require extremely low latency and high image quality. However, the limited bandwidth in wireless networks fails to meet the peak rate requirements for multiple video flows. MPTCP is suitable for wireless edge networks, supporting the simultaneous use of multiple networks on mobile devices. Nevertheless, accurately scheduling video data blocks to different subflows to satisfy their low latency requirements is challenging due to their micro-burst characteristic. This document proposes a novel cross-layer feedback method for video applications in edge networks, called the Cross- Layer Information-based One-Way Delay Predictive Scheduler (CPS). With these information, the MPTCP scheduler can accurately predict one-way delay and adaptively schedules video data blocks to the optimal subflow.</t>
