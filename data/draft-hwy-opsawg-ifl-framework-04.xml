    <abstract>
      <t>On-path telemetry techniques can provide high-precision inband flow insight and real-time network performance monitoring by embedding instructions or metadata into user packets. They are benificial but still has problems of deployability and flexibility in large scale deployment scenario. This document proposes a reference framework called Inband Flow Learning (IFL), which outlines the architecture and functional modules for automatic deployment and adjustment of flow-oriented monitoring using on-path telemetry techniques, trying to provide a solution for reference to solve the problems. This document also provides different deployment approaches and considerations in practical network deployment.</t>
