      <t>This document assigns two BGP extended community types, one transitive and one non-transitive. It also defines two IANA registries in order to allow the allocation of reserved transitive and non-transitive extended communities. These are similar to the existing reserved (formerly Well-known) BGP communities defined in RFC 1997 but provides an easier control of inter-AS community advertissement as a community could be chosen as transitive or non- transitive across ASes.</t>
