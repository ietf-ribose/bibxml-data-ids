    <abstract>
      <t>An LDP speaker negotiates the label advertisement mode with its LDP peer at the time of session establishment. Although different applications sharing the same LDP session may need different modes of label distribution and advertisement, there is only one type of label advertisement mode that is negotiated and used per LDP session. This document clarifies the use and the applicability of session's negotiated label advertisement mode, and categorizes LDP applications into two broad categories of negotiated mode-bound and mode-independent applications. The document also suggests an update to RFC5036 and RFC4447 to remove any ambiguity and conflict in the area of using correct label advertisement mode for a given application.</t>
