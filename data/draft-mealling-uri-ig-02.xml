      <t>This paper is the product of the W3C URI Interest Group. It addresses and attempts to clarify two issues pertaining to URIs, and presents recommendations. Section 1 addresses how URI space is partitioned and the relationship between URIs, URLs, and URNs. Section 2 describes how URI schemes and URN namespace ids are registered. Section 3 mentions additional unresolved issues not considered by this paper and section 4 presents recommendations. Questions concerning this document should be directed to the uri@w3.org mailing list.</t>
