    <abstract>
      <t>In this document, it identifies gateways for field-bus networks, data storages for archiving and developing data sharing platform, and application units to be important system components for developing digital communities: i.e., building-scale and city-wide ubiquitous facility networking infrastructure. The standard defines a data exchange protocol that generalizes and interconnects these components (gateways, storages, application units) over the IPv4/v6-based networks. This enables integration of multiple facilities, data storages, application services such as central management, energy saving, environmental monitoring and alarm notification systems.</t>
