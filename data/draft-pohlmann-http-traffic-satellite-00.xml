      <t>Internet use over satellites (LEO, MEO and GEO) has not received enough attention. Satellites have an inherent broadcasting ability useful for transmitting Internet traffic. They can send information to many locations simultaneously depending on the coverage beam of the satellite. The issue of Internet use over satellites needs to be addressed so that future implementations of networking protocols can be used with this medium. The vast majority of Internet traffic is TCP traffic resulting from the HTTP protocol so this issue will be addressed here. It is hoped that this facilitates the transition from the use of terrestial networks, to networks incorporating satellite links.</t>
