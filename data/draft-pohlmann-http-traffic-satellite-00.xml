      <t>Internet use over satellites (LEO, MEO and GEO) has notreceived enough attention. Satellites have an inherentbroadcasting ability useful for transmitting Internettraffic. They can send information to many locationssimultaneously depending on the coverage beam of thesatellite. The issue of Internet use over satellites needsto be addressed so that future implementations of networkingprotocols can be used with this medium. The vast majorityof Internet traffic is TCP traffic resulting from the HTTPprotocol so this issue will be addressed here. It is hopedthat this facilitates the transition from the use ofterrestial networks, to networks incorporating satellitelinks.</t>
