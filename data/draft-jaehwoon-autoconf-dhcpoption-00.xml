      <t>The mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a wireless network composed ofmobile nodes which can communicate with each other via multiplewireless links. The modified MANET architecture is now standardizingthat can resolve the multi-link subnet issue. In this draft, we define two DHCP options in order that a MANET Router (MR) gets the network prefix assigned to the connected MANET. The one is the MANETprefix request option used by a MR when it wants to know the networkpresix allocated to the MANET. The other is the MANET prefix optionthat DHCP server provides the MANET prefix to the requesting MR.</t>
