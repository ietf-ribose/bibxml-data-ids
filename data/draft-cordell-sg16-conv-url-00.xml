      <t>The evolving technologies for real-time conversation over the Internetrequire URLs to provide user contact information. As there are manyprotocols (including some that are not Internet based) that can be usedfor inter-user conversation, this document describes a two stagetransaction process for obtaining a URL that can be used to initiateconversation. The first stage involves retrieving a list of protocolspecific URLs in a MIME encoded file. The MIME type enables anappropriate application to be launched which will analyse the presentedURLs and select the most appropriate one. The second stage involvesinterpreting the protocol specific URL and initiating the conversation.The protocol specific URLs are encoded in a URL form so that they can beembedded directly into HTML pages. This allows the first stage to beomitted. The document describes the format of the MIME encoded list ofURLs, and the format of a number of protocol specific URLs.</t>
