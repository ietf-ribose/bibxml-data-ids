      <t>The evolving technologies for real-time conversation over the Internet require URLs to provide user contact information. As there are many protocols (including some that are not Internet based) that can be used for inter-user conversation, this document describes a two stage transaction process for obtaining a URL that can be used to initiate conversation. The first stage involves retrieving a list of protocol specific URLs in a MIME encoded file. The MIME type enables an appropriate application to be launched which will analyse the presented URLs and select the most appropriate one. The second stage involves interpreting the protocol specific URL and initiating the conversation. The protocol specific URLs are encoded in a URL form so that they can be embedded directly into HTML pages. This allows the first stage to be omitted. The document describes the format of the MIME encoded list of URLs, and the format of a number of protocol specific URLs.</t>
