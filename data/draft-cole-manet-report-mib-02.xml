      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it describes objects for configuring autonomous report generation on any device that supports MIBs containing counter and gauge objects for performance monitoring. This allows a management station to instruct a device to build off-line reports to be collected asynchronously by the management station.</t>
