      <t>The Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP) is an application level protocol to control media service resources like Speech Synthesizers, Recognizers, Signal Generators, Signal Detectors, Fax Servers etc. over a network. This document captures the extensions required to implement Voice Enrollment, Speaker Verification and Hotword recognition as well as to augment the recognizer functionality using MRCP. The extensions are largely orthogonal to existing features of MRCP and to each other, with an eye towards backwards compatibility with existing features and independence of the extensions from each other to simplify integration.</t>
