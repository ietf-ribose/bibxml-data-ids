      <t>The DNS is a query / response protocol. Failure to respond to queries causes both immediate operational problems and long term problems with protocol development. This document identifies a number of common classes of queries that some servers fail to respond too. This document also suggests procedures for TLD and other similar zone operators to apply to help reduce / eliminate the problem.</t>
