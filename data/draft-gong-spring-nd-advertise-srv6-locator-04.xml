    <abstract>
      <t>In an SRv6 network, each SRv6 segment endpoint has at least one SRv6 Locator. Through the SRv6 locator routes, other SRv6 segment nodes can steer traffic to that node. This document describes a method for an SRv6 endpoint (e.g., a host or a customer provider edge (CPE)) to advertise its SRv6 locator to a neighboring SRv6-aware router using extensions to the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol. This approach eliminates the need to run a full routing protocol stack on simple endpoints, facilitating SRv6 deployment in controlled, trusted domains such as data centers and managed access networks.</t>
