      <t>Additional functionality has been developed for UNIXr systems to address the TCSEC requirements for trusted systems. New requirements are driving efforts to develop interoperable, networked solutions for trusted UNIX environments. A specific approach for addressing TCSEC MLS requirements is identified in the CMW requirements document. Developing support for network interoperability among MLS classified systems is a primary goal of the trusted UNIX community.</t>
