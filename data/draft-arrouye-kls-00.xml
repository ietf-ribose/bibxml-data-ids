    <abstract>
      <t>This document emphasizes the convergence of thinking regarding Internet naming in the industry and the technical community. There is strong consensus for establishing a layer above the current DNS to address some of its current limitations. At the same time, the community stresses the necessity for the new layer to go beyond the sole needs of the domain name system to realize an architecture capable of accommodating diverse services, with separate ownerships, different scopes and distinct operating models. In that context, interoperability is critical.</t>
