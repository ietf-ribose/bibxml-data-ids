      <t>This document emphasizes the convergence of thinking regardingInternet naming in the industry and the technical community.There is strong consensus for establishing a layer above the currentDNS to address some of its current limitations. At the same time, thecommunity stresses the necessity for the new layer to go beyond thesole needs of the domain name system to realize an architecturecapable of accommodating diverse services, with separate ownerships,different scopes and distinct operating models. In that context,interoperability is critical.</t>
