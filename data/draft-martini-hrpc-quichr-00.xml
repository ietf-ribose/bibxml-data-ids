      <t>QUIC is a new transport protocol that provides low-latency communication and security. QUIC's key features include faster connection establishment, stream-based multiplexing, improved loss recovery, and no head-of-line blocking. This document assesses the potential human rights implications emerging from the deployment of QUIC. The assessment is done based on the methodology articulated in [RFC8280].</t>
