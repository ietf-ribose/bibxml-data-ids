      <t>Current Mobile IPv4 deployments use RADIUS based MIPv4 userauthentication and authorization. Diameter Mobile IPv4 Application[RFC4004] offers another method for MIPv4 authentication,authorization, and dynamic mobility security association allocation,e.g. MN-HA SA allocation. Some SDOs are considering the use ofDiameter Mobile IPv4 Application to replace RADIUS based mechanism.However, these SDos use a link layer access authentication mechanism,e.g., using an EAP application, to derive the related MIP4 sharedkeys and security association. This document an overview of theserespected architectures and their handling to MIP4 securityassociation and keys derivation and distribution. It presents ananalysis of the performance and impact of Diameter MIPv4 Applicationand RADIUS based solutions on the time the mobile node uses duringthe initial session setup. Some common MIPv4 scenarios which requirethe mobile node to retransmit its initial RRQ message have beenidentified and used. The set of assumptions and requirements usedfor this study has been clearly documented under section 5.</t>
