      <t>This document presents concepts and implementations of stateless/partial-state 1:N network address and protocol translation betweenIPv4 and IPv6 nodes.Stateless 1:N translation keeps the features of stateless, end-to-endaddress transparency and bidirectional-initiated communications ofthe original stateless translation (1:1 IVI), in addition it canutilize the IPv4 addresses more effectively. However, it requiresthe modification of the IPv6 end systems or deploying home gateways.By introducing "partial state" in the translator, this requirement isnot necessary.</t>
