      <t>This document describes a methodology for testing theoperation, administration and maintenance (OA&amp;M) of a generalVPN service, that is applied here to Hierarchical VirtualPrivate LAN Services (HVPLS) as described in [VPLS]. As partof this methodology, the MPLS ping concepts described in [LSP-PING] are extended to enable HVPLS spoke-to-spoke connectivitytesting. A method to provide the information necessary forthis spoke-to-spoke OA&amp;M is also proposed.These are the goals of this draft:- checking connectivity between 'service-aware'nodes of a network,- verifying data plane and control plane integrity,- verifying service membershipThere are two specific requirements to which we call attentionbecause of their seemingly contradictory nature:- the checking of connectivity MUST involve theability to use packets that look like customerpackets- the OAM packets MUST not propagate beyond theboundary of the provider network</t>
