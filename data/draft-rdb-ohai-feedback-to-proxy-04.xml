    <abstract>
      <t>To provide equitable service to clients, servers often rate-limit incoming requests, for example, based upon the source IP address. However, oblivious HTTP removes the ability for the server to distinguish amongst clients so the server can only rate-limit traffic from the oblivious relay. This harms all clients behind that oblivious relay. This specification enables a server to convey rate-limit information to an oblivious relay, which can use it to apply rate-limit policies on clients. Cooperating oblivious relays can thus provide more equitable service to their distinguishable clients without impacting on all clients behind that oblivious relay.</t>
