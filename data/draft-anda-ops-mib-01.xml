      <t>This document specifies an Open Provisioning Standard (OPS) that addresses the needs of an Integrated Communications Network (ICN) for remote and automatic service turn-up and for the simplification of monitoring and fault management across multiple network elements within the Loop Access environment and within the Customer Premises Environment (CPE) environment. OPS extends the standard Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Information Base (MIB) by defining voice/data integration and flow-through provisioning capabilities for the various devices within the ICN, such as Integrated Access Devices (IADs). OPS enables Carriers or Service Providers to control their Integrated Access Services (IAS) from the network management system in the Network Operation Center (NOC). Flow-through provisioning allows administrators to send provisioning commands to multiple network elements across the ICN. The provisioning commands are used to define or modify a customer's services and to turn those services on and off. Similarly, customer-initiated service requests as well as performance and fault management information for existing services can flow back to the carrier or service provider.</t>
