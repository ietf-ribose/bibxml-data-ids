      <t>This document specifies an Open Provisioning Standard (OPS) thataddresses the needs of an Integrated Communications Network (ICN)for remote and automatic service turn-up and for the simplificationof monitoring and fault management across multiple network elementswithin the Loop Access environment and within the Customer PremisesEnvironment (CPE) environment. OPS extends the standard SimpleNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP) Management Information Base (MIB)by defining voice/data integration and flow-through provisioningcapabilities for the various devices within the ICN, such asIntegrated Access Devices (IADs).OPS enables Carriers or Service Providers to control theirIntegrated Access Services (IAS) from the network management systemin the Network Operation Center (NOC). Flow-through provisioningallows administrators to send provisioning commands to multiplenetwork elements across the ICN. The provisioning commands are usedto define or modify a customer's services and to turn those serviceson and off. Similarly, customer-initiated service requests as wellas performance and fault management information for existingservices can flow back to the carrier or service provider.</t>
