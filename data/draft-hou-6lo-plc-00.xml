    <abstract>
      <t>Power Line Communication (PLC), namely using the electric-power lines for indoor and outdoor communications, has been widely applied to support Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), especially the smart meters for electricity. With the inherent advantage of existing electricity infrastructure, PLC is expanding deployments all over the world, indicating the potential demand of IPv6 for future applications. As part of this technology, Narrowband PLC (NBPLC) is focused on the low-bandwidth and low-power scenarios, including current standards such as IEEE 1901.2 and ITU-T G.9903. This document describes how IPv6 packets are transported over constrained PLC networks.</t>
