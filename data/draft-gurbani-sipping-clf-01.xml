      <t>Well-known web servers such as Apache and web proxies like Squidsupport event logging using a common log format. The logs producedusing these de-facto standard formats are invaluable to systemadministrators for trouble-shooting a server and tool writers tocraft tools that mine the log files and produce reports and trends.Furthermore, these log files can also be used to train anomalydetection systems and feed events into a security event managementsystem. The Session Initiation Protocol does not have a common logformat, and as a result, each server supports a distinct log formatthat makes it unnecessarily complex to produce tools to do trendanalysis and security detection. We propose a common log file formatfor SIP servers that can be used uniformly for proxies, registrars,redirect servers as well as back-to-back user agents.</t>
