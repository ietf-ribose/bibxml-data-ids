      <t>Internet access through public networks require authentication ofclients and networks to each other. While there are currently usedlink-layer protocols such as PPP, it is very desirable to provide anetwork-layer solution that can work across multiple types of links.Authentication of roaming clients is generally handled by AAAprotocols. In order to use AAA between the network and the client, weneed a protocol to carry required messages. This draft defines how wecan extend the standard router discovery protocol to use it as a carrier for the authentication purposes.</t>
