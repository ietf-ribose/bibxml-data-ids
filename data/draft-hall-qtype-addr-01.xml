      <t>This document defines mechanisms for providing all IP address resource records (specifically including any A and AAAA resource records) in DNS response messages. Specifically, this document defines an 'ADDR' query-type which allows a system to issue a single lookup for all of the addressing resource records associated with a domain name (explicitly including any IPv4 and IPv6 resource records), and also defines an algorithm for DNS servers to use when returning supplemental address data in the additional-data section of a response message.</t>
