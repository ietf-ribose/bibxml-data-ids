      <t>The proxy server plays a central role as an intermediary in theestablishment of sessions in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).In that role, they can define and impact policies on call routing,rendezvous, and other call features. However, there is no standardmeans by which proxies can have any influence on session policies,such as the codecs that are to be used. As such, ad-hoc andnon-conformant techniques have been deployed to allow for such policymechanisms. There is a need for a standards-based and completemechanism for session policies. This document defines a set ofrequirements for such a mechanism.</t>
