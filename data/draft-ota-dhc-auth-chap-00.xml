      <t>In delayed authentication in DHCPv6[RFC3315], the hardware identifier is used to select the key, and the key is exchanged between the server and the client in advance. Therefore, when a user tries to use a new device, it is necessary to add key information to the new device and DHCPv6 servers. In this document, we propose a procedure for introducing CHAP[RFC1994] into the DHCPv6 authentication procedure. This procedure allows the client get the host configuration information related to the user and exchanges a secret key to use in later sequence.</t>
