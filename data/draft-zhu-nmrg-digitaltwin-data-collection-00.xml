      <t>Digital Twin Network (DTN) is a network system with Physical Network and Twin Network, which can be mapped interactively in real time. The construction of Digital Twin Network requires real-time data of Physical Network to update the state of Twin Network. However the existing method collects the full amount of data from the Physical Network for modeling, and does not consider the problems such as insufficient storage resources, low computational efficiency and waste of bandwidth resources. This document introduces an efficient data collection method in which the Twin Network sends instructions to the Physical Network to collect data on demand, and then the Physical Network parses and executes instructions such as data cleaning and knowledge representation, and sends the processed or requested data to the Digital Twin Network.</t>
