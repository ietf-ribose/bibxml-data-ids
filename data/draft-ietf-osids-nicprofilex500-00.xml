      <t>The authors of this document, in conjuction with the chairs of the IETF Network Information Services Infrastructure (NISI) group, would like to implement a Directory of Network Information Centers, or NICs. This will enable NICs to find each other easily, will allow users with access to a DSA to find out where NICs are, and will in general facilitate the distribution of information about the Internet and some of its infrastructure. This Internet Draft proposes a set of standard schema for this information.</t>
