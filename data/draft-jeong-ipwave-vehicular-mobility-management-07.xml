    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a Vehicular Mobility Management (VMM) scheme for IP-based vehicular networks. The VMM scheme takes advantage of a vehicular link model based on a multi-link subnet. With a vehicle's mobility information (e.g., position, speed, acceleration/ deceleration, and direction) and navigation path (i.e., trajectory), it can provide a moving vehicle with proactive and seamless handoff along with its trajectory.</t>
