      <t>This document provides some guidelines for email clients that support Email Address Internationalization (EAI) as outlined in RFC 4952. A number of interoperability cases between different versions of email components are reviewed. Recommendations are made to improve interoperability and usability and to minimize discrepancies between the display of composed and received email in different language environments.</t>
