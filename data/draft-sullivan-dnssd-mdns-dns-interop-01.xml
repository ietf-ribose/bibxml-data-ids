      <t>Despite its name, DNS-Based Service Discovery can use naming systems other than the Domain Name System when looking for services. Different name systems use different conventions for the characters allowed in any name. In order for DNS-SD to be used effectively in environments where multiple different name systems are in use, it is important to attend to differences in the underlying technology. This memo presents an outline of the requirements for selection of labels for mDNS and DNS when they are expected to interoperate in this manner.</t>
