      <t>In order to join the overlay, a joining peer/client has to find the enrollment server first, and then acquire the configuration file from the enrollment server where it can find the bootstrap peers' information, and after that it contact a bootstrap node to route the join request message to join the overlay. However, nodes in P2PSIP overlay network are dynamic. They can leave gracefully or abruptly at any time. This document focuses on the bootstrap server mechanism and proposes a mechanism to select proper bootstrap peers and improve the availability of bootstrap nodes through bootstrap peer status maintenance.</t>
