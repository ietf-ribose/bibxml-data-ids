    <abstract>
      <t>Autonomic functions need a control plane to communicate, which depends on some addressing and routing. This Autonomic Management and Control Plane should ideally be self-managing, and as independent as possible of configuration. This document defines such a plane and calls it the "Autonomic Control Plane", with the primary use as a control plane for autonomic functions. It also serves as a "virtual out of band channel" for OAM (Operations Administration and Management) communications over a network that is secure and reliable even when the network is not configured, or not misconfigured.</t>
