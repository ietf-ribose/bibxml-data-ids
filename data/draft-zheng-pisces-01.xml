    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the Pisces, an ensemble video transport framework for real-time communication. Pisces complements the benefits of rule-based and learning-based approaches, without modifying the codec layer. Pisces uses an incremental and iterative reinforcement learning model to adapt to the unseen environment. When the real environment well matches the training environment, the learning-based approach is actively working. Otherwise, the rule- based approach is used to ensure transport safety. By simultaneously leveraging both rule-based logic and learning models to proactively probe network capacity, Pisces achieves high efficiency in both single-flow and cross-flow scenarios, while ensuring stable and fair cross-flow convergence. Pisces can be deployed in WebRTC, which replaces the default Google congestion control algorithm.</t>
