      <t>Numerous authentication mechanisms are in use today on the Internet. It is desirable to give administrators the choice of which mechanisms to support in their deployments and to give users the choice which mechanisms to use. This document offers terminology designed to be easily understandable by users and administrators of Internet services, while being meaningful to designers and developers of these services and associated Internet protocols.</t>
