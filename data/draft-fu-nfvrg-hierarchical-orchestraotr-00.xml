      <t>This document discusses about the framework of Orchestrator in the NFV deployment. A hierarchical framework of Orchestrator is then proposed. Such framework is very important for large scale NFV deployment in Operator networks, since multi-site of NFV deployment and management should be considered. This draft will further discuss the responsibilities of the multi-layers of the Orchestrator and the interfaces between them.</t>
