      <t>If the Internet is accessed via cellular networks, the Point-to-Pointprotocol (PPP) is most commonly used for configuration of thecircuit-switched or packet-switched link. Thus, this PPPconfiguration time comes in addition to the usual call-setup time forthe cellular connection. In many cases this will result in a fairlylong 'wait time' as perceived by end users before actual applicationdata can be transmitted.This proposal describes a solution in which the PPP configurationtime can be significantly reduced (on the order of seconds) in caseswhere both peer protocol entities can be modified according to thisproposal, which involves modifying standard PPP. In cases where onePPP peer is modified and the other utilizes only standard PPP, themodified peer can fallback to standard PPP operation. This fallbackmechanism will not noticeably affect the PPP setup time, and servesto ensure interoperability.</t>
