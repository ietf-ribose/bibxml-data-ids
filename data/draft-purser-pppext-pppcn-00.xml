      <t>If the Internet is accessed via cellular networks, the Point-to-Point protocol (PPP) is most commonly used for configuration of the circuit-switched or packet-switched link. Thus, this PPP configuration time comes in addition to the usual call-setup time for the cellular connection. In many cases this will result in a fairly long 'wait time' as perceived by end users before actual application data can be transmitted. This proposal describes a solution in which the PPP configuration time can be significantly reduced (on the order of seconds) in cases where both peer protocol entities can be modified according to this proposal, which involves modifying standard PPP. In cases where one PPP peer is modified and the other utilizes only standard PPP, the modified peer can fallback to standard PPP operation. This fallback mechanism will not noticeably affect the PPP setup time, and serves to ensure interoperability.</t>
