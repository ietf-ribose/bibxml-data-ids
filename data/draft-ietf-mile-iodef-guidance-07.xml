      <t>The Incident Object Description Exchange Format v2 [I-D.ietf-mile-rfc5070-bis] defines a data representation that provides a framework for sharing information commonly exchanged by Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) about computer security incidents. Since the IODEF model includes a wealth of available options that can be used to describe a security incident or issue, it can be challenging for security practicioners to develop tools that can leverage IODEF for incident sharing. This document provides guidelines for IODEF practicioners. It also addresses how common security indicators can be represented in IODEF and use-cases of how IODEF is being used so far. The goal of this document is to make IODEF's adoption by vendors easier and encourage faster and wider adoption of the model by Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) around the world.</t>
