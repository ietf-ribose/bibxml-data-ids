      <t>This memo sets out an MPLS-based solution to the IP service delivery problems as set out in RFC 2990. The solution is based on source routing of IP flows using MPLS label stacks. The solution elements are introduced sequentially and a usage scenario is mapped out that aligns with the work in the ISSLL working group.</t>
