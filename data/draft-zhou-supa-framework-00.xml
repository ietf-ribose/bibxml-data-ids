    <abstract>
      <t>Currently, there are a lot of network services that impose specific demands on a communication network, which makes it significantly more challenging to network management and service deployment. SUPA aims to provide a set of data models and a framework to simply the deployment and management of network services. This document describes the SUPA basic framework and its elements. The main SUPA framework entities are the Operation and Management Application (OAMA) and the Management Agent (MA). OAMA is a functional entity that creates and runs network services; MA is a functional entity which enables the generation, maintenance and release of network topologies and network service specific abstractions, and maps network service specific abstractions in combination with network topology and policy to detail network element configurations.</t>
