      <t>While the DNS zone master file format has always allowed comments, there is no existing mechanism to preserve comments once the zone has been loaded into memory or converted to a binary representation. This note proposes a new "NOTE" RR type, which is stored alongside zone data and may be included in zone transfers, but is not returned in response to DNS queries.</t>
