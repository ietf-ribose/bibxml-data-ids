      <t>This draft describes a light weight route optimization technique thathelps to optimize the media path between two communicating nodes whenProxy MIP is used as the mobility protocol. This routingoptimization technique is most useful when the two communicatinghosts are away from home and need to communicate with each otherusing an optimized path. It takes advantage of the data packetbetween LMA and MAG to set up the optimized data path between thecommunicating hosts. This route optimization technique is applicableto both the intra-LMA and inter-LMA scenarios.</t>
