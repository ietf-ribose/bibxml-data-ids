      <t>Tapping technologies provide traffic visibility to network analysis tools such as monitors, traffic recorders and security systems. Current tapping architectures and protocols are vendor specific and adapted to legacy networks. Emerging networking such as large scale datacenters for cloud applications and Mobile backhaul networks demand accurate and fast network traffic visibility. These networks are built on Layer 2 technologies and infrastructure to support virtual machines mobility, growing number of devices including mobile users. SmarTap architecture is designed to support emerging network requirements allowing network analysis tools to gain full visibility of network traffic. SmarTap technology monitors each link and each component of the network. It captures packets, classifies them and sends them to tools with relevant packet attributes. SmarTap can provide attributes such as flow-ID, tapping-location, tapping-time and statistics.</t>
