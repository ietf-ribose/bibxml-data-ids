    <abstract>
      <t>The 3GPP has done tremendous work to either standardize or study various types of wireless services that would depend on a satellite constellation network. While the ISLs, or Inter-Satellite Links, along with the routing scheme(s) over them are critical to help fullfil the satellite services, the 3GPP considers them out-of-scope. This leaves somewhat significant work to be explored in the IETF domain. This draft stems from the latest 3GPP satellite use cases, and lands on summarizing the restrictions &amp; challenges in term of satellite-based routing. Based on some unique &amp; advantageous characteristics associated with satellite movement, the draft raises briefly the general design principles and possible algorithms for the integrated NTN+TN routing, while leaves the implementation details for further expansion.</t>
