    <abstract>
      <t>To allow efficient allocation of optical spectral bandwidth for high bit-rate systems, the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) has extended its Recommendations G.694.1 and G.872 to include a new dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) grid by defining a set of nominal central frequencies, channel spacings and the concept of "frequency slot". In such an environment, a data plane connection is switched based on allocated, variable-sized frequency ranges within the optical spectrum creating what is known as a flexible grid (flexi- grid). This document defines a framework and the associated control plane requirements for the GMPLS-based control of flexi-grid DWDM networks.</t>
