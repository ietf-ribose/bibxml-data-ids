    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes experimentation to evaluate benefits and feasibility of an IPv6 routing extension header based architecture, implementation and deployment of stateless IPv6 multicast specifically for IPv6 only networks using SRv6 for IP unicast. This experimentation intends to explore options to support easier proliferation of technologies developed by BIER-WG by providing an IPv6/SRv6 network optimized packet header and per-hop forwarding mechanisms than BIERin6. It also discusses how this work related to exploring advanced in-packet tree encoding mechanisms for both IPv6/ SRv6 networks as well as BIER networks as a related effort.</t>
