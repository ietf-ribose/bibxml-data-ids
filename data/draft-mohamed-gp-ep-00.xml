      <t>This memo defines Global Postion/Encryption Protocol (GP/EP), a proposal for a universal wireless computer network. Global position is defined as region in space-time. The network routes data to a global position using routing information provided as part of the protocol data and proposes use of encryption algorithms to prevent unauthorised access. This protocol is proposed as an alternative for IP, the Internet Protocol. The memo also describes how a network can work with no real network address other than its global position in the universe.</t>
