      <t>The RSVP and Integrated Services working groups have been working towards the goal of an 'Integrated Services Internet' where applications can request a Quality of Service (QoS) from the network in order to meet their end-to-end service requirement [1]. This document reviews various issues related to running RSVP and Integrated Service models over ATM and presents a model to address some of these issues. It is intended as a starting point for building an architectural framework to support RSVP/ATM Interworking.</t>
