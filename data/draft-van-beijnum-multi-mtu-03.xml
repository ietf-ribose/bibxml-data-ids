      <t>In the early days of the internet, many different link types withmany different maximum packet sizes were in use. For point-to-pointor point-to-multipoint links, there are still some other link types(PPP, ATM, Packet over SONET), but multipoint subnets are now almostexclusively implemented as ethernets. Even though the relevantstandards mandate a 1500 byte maximum packet size for ethernet, moreand more ethernet equipment is capable of handling packets biggerthan 1500 bytes. However, since this capability isn't standardized,it is seldom used today, despite the potential performance benefitsof using larger packets. This document specifies mechanisms tonegotiate per-neighbor maximum packet sizes so that nodes on amultipoint subnet may use the maximum mutually supported packet sizebetween them without being limited by nodes with smaller maximumsizes on the same subnet.</t>
