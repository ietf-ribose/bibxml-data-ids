      <t>Computing-Aware Traffic Steering (CATS) takes into account both computing and networking resource metrics for selecting the appropriate service instance to forwarding the service traffic. This document described the usage of Computing-Aware Traffic Steering (CATS) within Midhaul (MH) networks in the O-RAN architecture. It details how CATS can enhance traffic steering decisions between Distributed Units (DUs) and Centralized Units (CUs) by considering both compute resource metrics (e.g., CPU and memory utilization of CU instances) and network performance metrics (e.g., bandwidth, latency, reliability). The document discusses the integration of CATS with O-RAN management frameworks, and the interplay with the Transport Network Manager (TNM) in O-RAN using standard interfaces defined by IETF (as for example the one for Network Slice Services for connectivity provisioning).</t>
