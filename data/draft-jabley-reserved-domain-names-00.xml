      <t>The Domain Name System (DNS) makes use of a hierarchical namingscheme. The validity of a particular name in the DNS is governed byprotocol, operational and policy considerations.The IETF has identified particular domain names to have specialconsiderations associated with their use. These domain names havebeen identified in various documents in the RFC series. Thisdocument describes the creation of an IANA registry to catalogue suchdomain names and provides direction about how this registry should bemaintained.This document does not identify any new domain name as having specialconsiderations associated with its use.</t>
