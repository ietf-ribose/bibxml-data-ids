    <abstract>
      <t>Based on the QoS architecture and the DS codepoints defined inRFC2474 and RFC2475 we define an application that creates a trustedenvironment. We introduce the notion of Trusted Networks (TN) anetwork that has to satisfy a set of rules that can be specified byeach network owner. Packets originating from this or another TN canbe treated with higher confidence and higher QoS than packets fromuntrusted networks. The basic tool of our proposal is ingressfiltering RFC2827. This approach may apply to both IPv4 and IPv6.</t>
