    <abstract>
      <t>Based on the QoS architecture and the DS codepoints defined in RFC2474 and RFC2475 we define an application that creates a trusted environment. We introduce the notion of Trusted Networks (TN) a network that has to satisfy a set of rules that can be specified by each network owner. Packets originating from this or another TN can be treated with higher confidence and higher QoS than packets from untrusted networks. The basic tool of our proposal is ingress filtering RFC2827. This approach may apply to both IPv4 and IPv6.</t>
