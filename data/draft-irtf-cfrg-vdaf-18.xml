    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Functions (VDAFs), a family of multi-party protocols for computing aggregate statistics over user measurements. These protocols are designed to ensure that, as long as at least one aggregation server executes the protocol honestly, individual measurements are never seen by any server in the clear. At the same time, VDAFs allow the servers to detect if a malicious or misconfigured client submitted an invalid measurement. Two concrete VDAFs are specified, one for general- purpose aggregation (Prio3) and another for heavy hitters (Poplar1).</t>
