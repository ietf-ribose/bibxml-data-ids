      <t>An SNMP MIB models a managed device as if every one of its objects may be atomically read and changed. In reality, many of a device's objects may be interdependent. Typically such dependencies are either undocumented or simply noted in MIB comments or DESCRIPTION clauses. This draft defines a syntax to capture MIB object dependencies and proposes tools for real-world implementation.</t>
