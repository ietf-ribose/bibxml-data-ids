      <t>The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS resource record type provides a mechanism for domains to express the allowed set of Certification Authorities that may issue certificates for the domain. The core CAA specification ([RFC8659]) solely defines Property Tags that restrict the issuance of certificates that certify domain names; it does not define a mechanism for domains to restrict the issuance of certificates that include email addresses. This specification defines a Property Tag that grants authorization to Certification Authorities to issue certificates which certify email addresses.</t>
