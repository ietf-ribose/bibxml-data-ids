      <t>Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) specifies a method for securingNeighbor Discovery (ND) signaling against specific threats. Asspecified today, SEND assumes that the node advertising an address isthe owner of the address and is in possession of the private key usedto generate the digital signature on the message. This means thatthe Proxy ND signaling initiated by nodes that do not possessknowledge of the address owner's private key cannot be secured usingSEND. This document extends the current SEND specification withsupport for Proxy ND, the Secure Proxy ND Support for SEND.</t>
