      <t>This document defines an IP paging concept that supports a registered idle state of a mobile node and coordinates paging independent of the underlying layer-2 medium. The concept specifies a generic protocol that allows to abstract away from layer-2 paging capabilities up to the Access Routers, providing wired or wireless network access to idle mobile terminals. A new entity, called Paging Agent, is introduced. This Paging Agent supports employment of several different paging strategies. The reference mobility architecture of this specification is Mobile IPv6. Avoiding modifications of Mobile IPv6 entities, the paging concept integrates modularly into the mobility environment</t>
