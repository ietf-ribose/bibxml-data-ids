      <t>This memo describes two methods for using Kerberos [KRB5] for authentication and key exchange in the Secure Shell protocol. The first method uses Kerberos as a means to authenticate the Diffie-Hellman exchange described in [SSH-TRANSPORT]. The second method uses Kerberos for authentication and key-exchange. This memo also defines a new user authentication method which allows an authorization name and optional credentials to build upon the underlying authenticated key exchange.</t>
