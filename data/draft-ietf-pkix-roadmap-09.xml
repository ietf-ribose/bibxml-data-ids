      <t>This document provides an overview or 'roadmap' of the work done by the IETF PKIX working group. It describes some of the terminology used in the working group's documents, and the theory behind an X.509-based Public Key Infrastructure, Privilege Management Infrastructure (PMI), and Time Stamping and Data Certification Infrastructures. It identifies each document developed by the PKIX working group, and describes the relationships among the various documents. It also provides advice to would-be PKIX implementors about some of the issues discussed at length during PKIX development, in hopes of making it easier to build implementations that will actually interoperate.</t>
