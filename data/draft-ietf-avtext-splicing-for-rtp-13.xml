      <t>Content splicing is a process that replaces the content of a main multimedia stream with other multimedia content and delivers the substitutive multimedia content to the receivers for a period of time. Splicing is commonly used for insertion of local advertisements by cable operators, whereby national advertisement content is replaced with a local advertisement. This memo describes some use cases for content splicing and a set of requirements for splicing content delivered by RTP. It provides concrete guidelines for how an RTP mixer can be used to handle content splicing. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>
