      <t>This document presents an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-Specific Event Notification mechanism for subscribing to a homogeneous list of resources. Instead of the subscriber sending a SUBSCRIBE for each resource individually, the subscriber can define an ad-hoc resource list, subscribe to it, and maintain it â€“ all within a single SUBSCRIBE dialog. Changes in the state of the resources are reported using the same dialog in any standard SIMPLE format for conveying notifications for lists of resources or individual resources and agreed during the SUBSCRIBE dialog establishment.</t>
