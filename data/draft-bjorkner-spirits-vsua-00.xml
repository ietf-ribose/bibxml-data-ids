      <t>This document discusses events occurring in a telephony network that could be useful for call related services created in an Internet environment. It also shows one possible implementation of a SPIRITS protocol based on Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [2]. The SPIRITS working group has not yet done any protocol decisions, so this draft is written for informative purpose showing that the introduction of virtual SIP user agents (SIP UAs) in a SPIRITS client makes it possible to realize the services described in the pre-spirits implementations document [3].</t>
