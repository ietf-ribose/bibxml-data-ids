      <t>This document describes a proposed architecture for the construction of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). This proposal differs from [1] and [2] in that the functionality of the VPN is shared by the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE). Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) is used as a tunneling mechanism across the ISP network.</t>
