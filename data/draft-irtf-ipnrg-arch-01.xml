      <t>This document describes an architecture for delay-tolerant networks,and is a generalization of the architecture designed for theInterplanetary Internet: a communication system to provide Internet-like services across interplanetary distances in support of deepspace exploration. This generalization addresses networks whoseoperational characteristics make conventional networking approachesbecome either unworkable or impractical. We define a message-basedoverlay that exists above the transport layer of the networks onwhich it is hosted. The draft presents an architectural overviewfollowed by discussions of services, topology, routing, security,reliability and state management. It concludes with a discussion ofend-to-end information exchange, including an example.</t>
