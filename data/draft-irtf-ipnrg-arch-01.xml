    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an architecture for delay-tolerant networks, and is a generalization of the architecture designed for the Interplanetary Internet: a communication system to provide Internet- like services across interplanetary distances in support of deep space exploration. This generalization addresses networks whose operational characteristics make conventional networking approaches become either unworkable or impractical. We define a message-based overlay that exists above the transport layer of the networks on which it is hosted. The draft presents an architectural overview followed by discussions of services, topology, routing, security, reliability and state management. It concludes with a discussion of end-to-end information exchange, including an example.</t>
