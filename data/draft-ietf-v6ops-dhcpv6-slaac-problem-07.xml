      <t>The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) Protocol includes an ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) message. The RA message contains three flags, indicating the availability of address auto-configuration mechanisms and other configuration such as DNS-related configuration. These are the M, O, and A flags, which by definition are advisory, not prescriptive. This document describes divergent host behaviors observed in popular operating systems. It also discusses operational problems that the divergent behaviors might cause.</t>
