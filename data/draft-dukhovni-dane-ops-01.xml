      <t>This memo provides operational guidance to server operators to help ensure that clients will be able to authenticate a server's certificate chain via published TLSA records. Guidance is also provided to clients for selecting reliable TLSA record parameters to use for server authentication. Finally, guidance is given to protocol designers who wish to make use of TLSA records to secure protocols using a TLS and TLSA combination.</t>
