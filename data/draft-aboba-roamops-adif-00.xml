      <t>This document describes an extensible human-readable accounting record format, the Accounting Data Interchange Format (ADIF). Based on MIME, ADIF is designed to compactly represent accounting data from any protocol using attribute/value pairs (AVPs) or variable bindings. ADIF may be used within accounting systems in several ways. In some cases, Accounting Servers will produce ADIF records based on data obtained from accounting protocols. It is also possible for devices to store data in ADIF format and transfer ADIF records to the accounting server, using an accounting or file transfer protocol. The latter approach has the advantage of offloading the Accounting Server from the task of transcribing interim or session records, thus improving scalability. In either scenario, ADIF may be used to transfer a single accounting records, or a batch of accounting records.</t>
