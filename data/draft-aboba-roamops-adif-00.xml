      <t>This document describes an extensible human-readable accounting recordformat, the Accounting Data Interchange Format (ADIF). Based on MIME,ADIF is designed to compactly represent accounting data from anyprotocol using attribute/value pairs (AVPs) or variable bindings.ADIF may be used within accounting systems in several ways. In somecases, Accounting Servers will produce ADIF records based on dataobtained from accounting protocols. It is also possible for devices tostore data in ADIF format and transfer ADIF records to the accountingserver, using an accounting or file transfer protocol. The latterapproach has the advantage of offloading the Accounting Server from thetask of transcribing interim or session records, thus improvingscalability. In either scenario, ADIF may be used to transfer a singleaccounting records, or a batch of accounting records.</t>
