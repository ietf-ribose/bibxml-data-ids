      <t>The Delay Tolerant Networking 'ipn' Endpoint Identifier scheme was first defined as Compressed Bundle Header Encoding (CBHE) [RFC6260] for use with the Bundle Protocol version 6 (BPv6) [RFC5050]. [RFC7116] updated [RFC6260] and requested IANA registries associated with the ipn scheme when used with BPv6. The Bundle Protocol version 7 (BPv7) specification [RFC9171] also defines an ipn scheme (for use with BPv7) by reusing the format from [RFC6260]. The evolution and specification of the ipn scheme has led to confusion over its use and format between BPv6 and BPv7. This document defines the ipn scheme as it is to be used with BPv7 and also updates [RFC7116] to make it clear that IANA CBHE registries are only to be used for BPv6. This document also updates the format of the BPv7 ipn scheme to include Numbering Authorities and requests the formation of BPv7 ipn scheme IANA registries.</t>
