    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies algorithm identifiers and ASN.1 encoding format for the United States National Institute of Standards and Technology's Post Quantum Cryptography Key Encapsulation Mechanism algorithms. The algorithms covered are Kyber TBD1. The encoding for public key and private key is also provided. [EDNOTE: This draft is not expected to be finalized before the NIST PQC Project has standardized PQ algorithms. After NIST has standardized its first algorithms, this document will replace TBD, with the appropriate algorithms and parameters before proceeding to ratification. The algorithm Kyber TBD1 has been added as an example in this draft, to provide a more detailed illustration of the content - it by no means indicates its inclusion in the final version. This specification will use object identifiers for the new algorithms that are assigned by NIST, and will use placeholders until these are released.]</t>
