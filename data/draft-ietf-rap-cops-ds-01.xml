    <abstract>
      <t>There is a clear need for relatively simple and coarse methods of providing differentiated classes of service for Internet traffic, to support various types of services, and specific business requirements. The IETF has chartered the Differentiated Service WG to define the differentiated services architecture and a common language for differentiated services. In parallel, the IETF RSVP Admission Policy (RAP) WG has defined the COPS (Common Open Policy Service) protocol [COPS]. This document describes enhancements to the Common Open Policy Service (COPS) protocol to support policy services in a Differentiated Services (DiffServ) environment. Further modifications to COPS for DiffServ may be proposed in the future, but what is presented here is thought to be the minimum necessary additions.</t>
