      <t>This internet-draft proposes a general approach for adding flow support to CLNP. This is useful both for reservation of resources in routers for support of applications with specific application service requirements, and for coordination with subnet connections when operating over connection oriented subnets (for example for operation of CLNP over ATM). Futher work is needed to define the protocol in detail.</t>
