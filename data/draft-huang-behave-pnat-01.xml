      <t>IPv4 migrating to IPv6 is a network layer's issue, it is not easy tomandate all the applications in the host to change in the firstplace, the network layer may have to have a solution to support theconventional IPv4 appliations during the IPv6 migration such as inthe dual stack or IPv6 only network, especially when multipleapplications need to be supported. This document describes amechanism for providing a host-based IPv6 translation technologywhich could guarantee IPv4 application backward compatibility.Applications need not necessarily to understand what the networkconnection and the destination's IP family type are. A well-knownprefix could be used when the destination is public IPv4 Internet'saddress.</t>
