      <t>This document specifies a mechanism that a DOTS client can use to signal that a network is under a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack to an upstream DOTS server so that appropriate mitigation actions are undertaken (including, blackhole, drop, rate-limit, or add to watch list) on the suspect traffic. The document specifies both DOTS signal and data channels. Happy Eyeballs considerations for the DOTS signal channel are also elaborated.</t>
