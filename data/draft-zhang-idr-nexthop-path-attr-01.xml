      <t>As the BGP is deployed in a single Autonomous System for network convergence such as Seamless MPLS, it is desirable for BGP to carry more information to help select routing more intelligently. It can reduce the cost proposed by complex policy control design on BGP routes and adapt to network change easily. This document proposed a new path attribute for BGP routes that can record the next hop path for the route to help BGP route selection and network management.</t>
