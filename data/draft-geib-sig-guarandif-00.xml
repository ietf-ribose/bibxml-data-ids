      <t>On demand Internet services with guaranteed throughput are the majordriver behind QoS signaling architectures. Guaranteeing throughputbetween two defined points of a DiffServ network requires acombination of flow information and Per Hop Behaviour. Handlingaggregates instead of flows as specified by the DiffServarchitecture is the most reasonable attempt to do so. This documentdescribes an architecture using DiffServ mechanisms to provideon demand throughput guarantees between two points of a DiffServnetwork.</t>
