      <t>On demand Internet services with guaranteed throughput are the major driver behind QoS signaling architectures. Guaranteeing throughput between two defined points of a DiffServ network requires a combination of flow information and Per Hop Behaviour. Handling aggregates instead of flows as specified by the DiffServ architecture is the most reasonable attempt to do so. This document describes an architecture using DiffServ mechanisms to provide on demand throughput guarantees between two points of a DiffServ network.</t>
