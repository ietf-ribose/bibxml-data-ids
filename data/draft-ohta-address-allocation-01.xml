      <t>The current usage based IPv4 address assignment policies might have prolonged the useful lifetime of IPv4 address space but this has to the detriment of the the end-to-end architecture of the Internet. This memo proposes the adoption of an address assignment strategy that releases large blocks of IPv4 address space into the Internet. The objective of this policy is to encourage healthy Internet deployment models with end-to-end transparency and association of permanent connectivity with a stable IP address. This is intended to encourage provider support for open transparent Internet service environments that can be sustained with the adoption of IPv6.</t>
