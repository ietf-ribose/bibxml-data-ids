      <t>This document describes the problem space of remote service installation and configuration in the provider's network through a centralized management system. This is a typical scenario for virtual function installation and dynamic configuration in network function virtualization (NFV) context. It is also a typical scenario in cloud computing environment where end users do not have to install applications in their end hosts, but can install their own featured powerful software application in the cloud. This specification also identifies the scope that needs standardization based on the problems.</t>
