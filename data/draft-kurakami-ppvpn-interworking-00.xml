      <t>There exist requirements of provider-provisioned virtual private networks (PPVPN) spanning multiple differently implemented SP networks from SPs perspective. This document proposes an interworking method at the interface for implementing PPVPNs spanning multiple SP networks with different technologies; it proposes the establishment of connections making use of GRE, IPsec, Frame Relay, or ATM connections at network interface, and describes how required services of the PPVPNs, such as security/privacy, quality of service, extranets, dynamic routing, and multicast, are achieved through network interface.</t>
