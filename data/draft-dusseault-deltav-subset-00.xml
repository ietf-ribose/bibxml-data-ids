      <t>This document specifies a consistent profile or subset of the features from the DeltaV specification [DeltaV]. The subset is suitable for simple linear document versioning in a WebDAV [RFC2518] environment. The subset is intended to limit functionality in order to improve predictability and thus interoperability. If a server advertises support for this subset, then a client can interoperate with that server very easily due to its predictability. A server advertising support for this subset MUST also support DeltaV.</t>
