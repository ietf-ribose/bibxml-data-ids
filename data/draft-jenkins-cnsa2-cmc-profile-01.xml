    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a profile of the Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) protocol for managing X.509 public key certificates in applications that use the Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite published by the United States Government. The profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of US National Security Systems that manage X.509 public key certificates over CMS. It is also appropriate for all other US Government systems that process high-value information. This memo is not an IETF standard, and does not represent IETF community consensus. The profile is made publicly available here for use by developers and operators of these and any other system deployments.</t>
