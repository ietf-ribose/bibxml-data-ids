      <t>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) [I-D.ietf-bier-architecture] is an architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding through a "BIER domain" without requiring intermediate routers to maintain any multicast related per-flow state. BIER also does not require any explicit tree-building protocol for its operation. Currently, the data plane of BIER is apt to use BIER-MPLS encapsulation to transmit multicast traffic. However, this document tries to propose a solution name BIER-Lite about how to extend OSPF protocol to support BIER forwarding in non-MPLS underlay network instead of MPLS underlay network.</t>
