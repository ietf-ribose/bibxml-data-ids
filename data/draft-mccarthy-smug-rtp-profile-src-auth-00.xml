      <t>This document describes a mechanism for authentication of the source of a stream of Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) packets. The mechanism provides sender-specific authentication, non-repudiation, and replay protection services for both unicast and multicast RTP streams. This mechanism is based upon the stream signing scheme of Wong and Lam [WL]. These authentication services extend the RTP profile for audio and video conferences with minimal control [Schulzrinne96, Schulzrinne99]. Authentication covers all RTP payload types, and may be applied in conjunction with the RTP confidentiality service. Key management and negotiation of the authentication mechanism parameters are not addressed in this document.</t>
