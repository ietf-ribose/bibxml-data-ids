      <t>MPLS is the heart and soul of the service provider network. MPLScan carry anydata payload which gives the flexibility to the serviceprovider to provision new service with any expense.The benefit of thistechnology is core router need not understand the full customer route.If the service a layer 2 then thereis no need of vrf, for customer theservice provider cloud is like a virtual switch.The protocol used forlabel distribution is LDP, BGP,RSVP. The most popular protocol forouter label distribution is LDP. LDP has the benefit of adding more TLV toits payload. In this the possibility of using ldp for generating labelsfor mac address rather for ip address which gives the benefit to serviceprovider not to run complex routing protocol on core, this does not requireip address. This gives service provider the flexibility to deploy any services,there is no need for changes in network layer when the customer goes foripv4 to ipv6. This can reduce the CAPEX and OPEX of the customer and reducesthe hardware cost too.</t>
