      <t>RFC 4034 allocates one value in the IANA registry for DNSSEC algorithm numbers for private algorithms. That may be too few for experimentation where multiple yet-to-be-assigned algorithms are used. This document assigns seven more values for this use case. This document is currently maintained at https://github.com/paulehoffman/draft-hoffman-more-private-algs. Issues and pull requests are welcomed. If the document is later adopted by a working group, a new repository will likely be created.</t>
