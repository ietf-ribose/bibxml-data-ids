      <t>The IPv6 neighbor discovery cache is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack that purposely exhausts the state used during the neighbor discovery address resolution process described in RFC 4861. This attack can be very disruptive when the target is a router. This memo updates RFC 4861 with a stateless form of neighbor discovery; it does not require any changes to hosts.</t>
