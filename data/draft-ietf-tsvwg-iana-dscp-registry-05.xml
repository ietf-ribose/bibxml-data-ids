      <t>The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture specifies use of a field in the IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers to carry Diffserv Codepoint (DSCP) values. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains a registry of assigned DSCP values. This update to RFC2474 changes the IANA assignment method for Pool 3 of the registry (i.e., DSCP values of the form xxxx01) to Standards Action, i.e., values are assigned through a Standards Track or Best Current Practice RFC. The update also removes permission for experimental and Local Use of the Codepoints that form Pool 3 of the DSCP registry; Pool 2 Codepoints (i.e., DSCP values of the form xxxx11) remain available for these purposes.</t>
