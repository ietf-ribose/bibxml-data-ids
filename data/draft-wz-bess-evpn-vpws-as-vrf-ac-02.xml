      <t>When a VRF Attachment Cirucit (VRF-AC) is far away from its IP-VRF instance, we can deploy an EVPN VPWS ([RFC8214]) between that VRF-AC and its IP-VRF instance. From the viewpoint of the IP-VRF instance, a local virtual interface takes the place of that remote "VRF-AC". The IP address for that VRF-AC is now configured to the virtual interface, in other words, the virtual interface is the actual VRF-AC of the IP-VRF instance. The virtual interface is also the AC of that VPWS instance, in other words, the virtual interface is cross- connected to that remote "VRF-AC" by the VPWS instance. This document proposes an extension to [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-inter-subnet-forwarding] to support this scenario.</t>
