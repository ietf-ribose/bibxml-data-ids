      <t>This document proposes a syntax which would enable network administrators to express and describe their routing policy in a globally consistent manner and therefore to facilitate routing policy sharing, analysis, coordination, implementation and enforcement in the Internet. At the same time, it also proposes and discusses a model for routing policy sharing and coordination based on the description of routing policies using such syntax.</t>
