      <t>This document describes a connectionless tunneling architecture that is applicable to layer 3 PE-based virtual private networks and specifies protocols for implementing it. This tunneling architecture is designed to facilitate scalability and reliability. A prominent feature of it is to provide VPN tunnels over a connectionless network. Since a connectionless network can provide full mesh connectivity without a connection establishment procedure, the architecture enables scalable operation of a VPN more efficiently than connection-oriented tunneling technologies.</t>
