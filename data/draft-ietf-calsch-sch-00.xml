      <t>This document defines a MIME message format for openly scheduling meetings with others across the Internet. This definition is independent of any particular scheduling application. A new MIME Content-Type 'APPLICATION/CALENDAR' is defined to contain scheduling data, including appointments, appointment requests for single events, appointment requests for recurring events, appointment responses. The scope of this revision of the draft is the MIME format for meeting requests and responses. This the 'on the wire' format; no attempt is made to define the storage format for the calendar information.</t>
