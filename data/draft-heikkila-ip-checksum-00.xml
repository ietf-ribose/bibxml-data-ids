      <t>This document reformulates the definition of TCP/IP checksum. The new formulation is equivalent to the traditional one, but it uses much simpler mathematics, avoiding concepts like "one's complement sum". This document attempts to be helpful for both newbies and seasoned engineers when considering checksum problems. Practical calculation and software examples are included.</t>
