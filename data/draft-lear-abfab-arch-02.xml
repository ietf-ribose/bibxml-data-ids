      <t>Over the last decade a substantial amount of work has occurred in thespace of federated access management. Most of this effort hasfocused on two use-cases: network and web-based access. However, thesolutions to these use-cases that have been proposed and deployedtend to have few common building blocks in common.This memo describes an architecture that makes use of extensions tothe commonly used security mechanisms for both federated and non-federated access management, including RADIUS, Diameter, GSS, GS2,EAP and SAML. The architecture addresses the problem of federatedaccess management to primarily non-web-based services, in a mannerthat will scale to large numbers of federations.</t>
