    <abstract>
      <t>For the Multiprotocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) linear protection capable of 1+1 and 1:1 protection has already been defined. That linear protection mechanism has not been designed for handling multiple, simultaneously occuring failures, i.e. multiple failures that affect the working and the protection entity during the same time period. In these situations currently defined protection mechanisms would fail. This document introduces use cases and requirements for mechanisms that are capable of protecting against such failures. It does not specify a multi-failure protection mechanism itself.</t>
