      <t>Verified Hello (VHLO) is an SMTP extension for managing authorizationby policy, as done for whitelisting messages. The VHLO command verbprovides for weak authentication of SMTP clients and policynegotiation.Policies and reputation are being increasingly used to identifymessages worthiness. However, they are currently enforced byrejecting SMTP transactions, or discarding messages. Feedback isscarce, also because reply codes are difficult to interpretautomatically. Negotiation is not provided for. VHLO is designed sothat servers can provide feedback to their clients about whichvouching services or authentication methods they require.Credentials can also be negotiated on the fly, in order to allowclients to learn whether messages will be whitelisted by thereceiving server before actually transmitting them. Negotiation andfeedback are intended to ease rapid diffusion of popular reputationsystems and authentication methods. A IANA register is defined forextending the set of available methods.The VHLO command is similar to EHLO, but accepts a series ofparameters. The sender communicates the mail domain name of theorganization on whose behalf it operates, along with any vouchingservices (VBR) for its reputation. On the other hand, the sendinghost's affiliation with that mail domain is checked by DNS lookups(MX, PTR, or SPF) or using DKIM. DNSBLs and Greylisting are alsoconsidered.Weakly authenticated clients enjoy an intermediate level of trust:they have no relying privileges, but may attempt to deliver mail tolocal users, are whitelisted from some filters, and may receive DSNsand feedback-loop abuse reports as needed. However, failing tosuccesfully negotiate VHLO authentication does not preclude aclient's ability to relay mail: It may relay as usual; that is tosay, without knowing whether the credentials it tries to provide haveany meaning for the receiving server.</t>
