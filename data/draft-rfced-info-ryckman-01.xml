      <t>This document suggests a method for delivering alarm information over the Internet. All communication shall use an encryption algorithm for transmission of the data. An immediate response from the host will be used for verification of receipt of the message. This transmission method may be use as a backup transmission method to traditional dial-up or leased line methods, or as a primary transmission method with traditional methods becomming the backup. Due to the required security of the data being transmitted, the encryption algorithm used will only be released on a need to know basis to software developers in the Alarm/Security Industry. A non-disclosure agreement will be required. Terms and conditions of the licensing will depend on the intended purpose for use and may require a non-competition agreement or licensing fees. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has assigned port 1733 for the registered use of SIIPAT transmissions.</t>
