      <t>This document specifies an identifier and challenge type required to enable the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) to issue certificates using a token for the challenge response. This token is issued by a administrative authority with whom the Certification Authority (CA) has a trust relationship. The entity requesting a certificate also has a relationship with the administrative authority, such that the administrative authority assigns a unique code to the entity. This entity code is included as part of the token that the administrative authority issues.</t>
