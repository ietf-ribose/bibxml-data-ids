      <t>This document defines the mesh link establishment (MLE) protocol for establishing and configuring links in an ad hoc mesh radio network. Effective mesh networking using radio links requires identifying, configuring, and securing usable links to neighboring devices. In an ad hoc mesh network a device's neighbors may come and go as the network's membership and physical environment change. Newly usable links need to be identified and configured automatically, where configuration values can include link-layer addresses, transmit and receive modes, security parameters, and so forth. MLE includes the option of securing the configuration messages themselves, as link- layer security may not be available prior to configuration.</t>
