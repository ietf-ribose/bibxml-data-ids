    <abstract>
      <t>STAMP is typically used to perform the measurement of one-way and round-trip performance metrics. However, when using active measurement mechanisms in a multi-path topology, the default forwarding behavior is to go through one path. So, it cannot collect the information of all the paths at one time. This document extends STAM with a Multi-path TLV to implement the multi-path performance measurement, which can help the operators to know the performance of network comprehensively and efficiently.</t>
