      <t>This memo describes a new protocol for mobile internetworking: the Internet Packet Transmission Protocol (IPTP). IPTP provides packet forwarding and host location functions that make mobility transparent to all protocols above IP. IPTP specifies control messages between the networking software on mobile hosts and a special Packet Forwarding Service. Backward compatibility is provided by requiring no modifications to stationary hosts or internetwork routers. To reduce overhead, IPTP provides for lazy propagation of location updates. To enhance performance, routes adapt as mobile hosts move.</t>
