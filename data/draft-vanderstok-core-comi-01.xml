      <t>The draft describes an interface based on CoAP to manage constrained devices via MIBs. The proposed integration of CoAP with SNMP reduces the code- and application development complexity by accessing MIBs via a standard CoAP server. The payload of the MIB request is JSON, CBOR or XML (EXI). The mapping from SMI to XML, JSON and CBOR is specified. Note Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to core@ietf.org.</t>
