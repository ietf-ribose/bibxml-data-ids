      <t>The purpose of this memo is to highlight the new QoS requirements of the multiparty communication services in terms of measurement parameters. It tries to derive a set of parameter metrics from the existing one-way metrics in IP Performance metrics IPPM [2] [3] [4] for the multiparty communications to present these new requirements. These parameter metrics are supposed to provide methods and rules for engineers to measure and judge the QoS of the multiparty communications.</t>
