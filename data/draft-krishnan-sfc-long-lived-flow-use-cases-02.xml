    <abstract>
      <t>Long-lived flows such as file transfers, video streams are common in today's networks. In the context of service function chaining, this draft suggests use cases for dynamic bypass of certain service nodes for such flows. The benefit of this approach would be to avoid expensive Layer 7 service node processing for such flows based on dynamic decisions and improve overall performance.</t>
