      <t>This document describes a QoS PIF MIB (Quality-of-ServiceProgramming-Interface Management-Information-Base) to be used as anSNMP-based programming interface for routers. This MIB is intendedto be a programming interface for router QoS functions, especiallyDiffServ-related [RFC2475] functions including packet scheduling(queuing), dropping, and metering that must be modular and conciselydescribed. Traffic-conditioning rules and metering rules forDiffServ-related functions are defined modularly by using 'virtualflow labels' and exclusive conditions in rules, and newclassifications for packet-scheduling and packet-dropping functionsare introduced. This document focuses on satisfying the requirementson programming interfaces or programming languages for routercontrol. Thus, the focus is different from that of DiffServ MIB[DSMIB] or QoS PIB [QoSPIB].</t>
