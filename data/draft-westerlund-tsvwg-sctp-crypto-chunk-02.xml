    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a method for adding cryptographic protection to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). The SCTP CRYPTO chunk defined in this document is intended to enable communications privacy for applications that use SCTP as their transport protocol and allows applications to communicate in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping and detect tampering or message forgery. The CRYPTO chunk defined here in is one half of a complete solution. Where a companion specification is required to define how the content of the CRYPTO chunk is protected, authenticated, and protected against replay, as well as how key management is accomplished. Applications using SCTP CRYPTO chunk can use all transport features provided by SCTP and its extensions but with some limitations.</t>
