      <t>This description addresses the method for using internationalized (multilingual) domain names under the current DNS. Further, the method for converting a internationalized domain name expressed in a native language, into a traditional US-ASCII domain name compatible in current DNS, is addressed. This method especially uses 'sequence of 36 characters' to convert all characters in IDN into US-ASCII. Finally, the way to use this method with lc2LDs are presented.</t>
