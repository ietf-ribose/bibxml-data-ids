      <t>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to manipulate configuration datastores. However, client applications often need to be aware of common events, such as a change in NETCONF server capabilities, that may impact management applications. Standard mechanisms are needed to support the monitoring of the base system events within the NETCONF server. This document defines a YANG module that allows a NETCONF client to receive notifications for some common system events. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
