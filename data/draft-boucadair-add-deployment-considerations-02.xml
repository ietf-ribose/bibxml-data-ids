    <abstract>
      <t>The document discusses some deployment considerations of the various options to discover encrypted DNS resolvers (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS, or DNS-over-QUIC). In particular, the document describes how Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) and Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR) can be used in typical deployment contexts. This document does not intend to provide deployment recommendations, but is meant to exemplify how operators can enable the encrypted DNS discovery mechanisms. In addition, the document illustrates the feasibility of hosting encrypted DNS forwarders in Customer Premises Equipment (CPEs).</t>
