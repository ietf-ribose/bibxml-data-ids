      <t>The secure shell (SSH) traditionally offers its secure services over an insecure network using the TCP transport protocol. This document defines mechanisms to access remote terminals by running the SSH Connection protocol over HTTP/3 using Extended CONNECT. Remote terminals over HTTP/3 enables additional benefits such as the scalability offered by HTTP multiplexing, relying on TLS for secure channel establishment leveraging X.509 certificates, HTTP Authentication schemes for client and server authentication, UDP port forwarding and stronger resilience against packet injection attacks and middlebox interference.</t>
