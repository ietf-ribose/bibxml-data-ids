      <t>In order to generate a unique address, IPv6 nodes perform the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) procedure. Payload packets can not be sent or received before this procedure is complete. In an environment where frequent movements are expected, this delay can be problematic. As the reduction or removal of the delay would be useful, an optimized version of DAD has been proposed. This document suggests the requirements for such "Optimized DAD" protocol as well as considerable solutions.</t>
