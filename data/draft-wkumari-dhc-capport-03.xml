      <t>In many environments (such as hotels, coffee shops and other establishments that offer Internet service to customers), it is common to start new connections in a captive portal mode, i.e. highly restrict what the customer can do until the customer has accepted terms of service, provided payment information or authenticated. This document describes a DHCP option (and an RA extension) to inform clients that they are behind some sort of captive portal device, and that they will need to authenticate to get Internet Access.</t>
