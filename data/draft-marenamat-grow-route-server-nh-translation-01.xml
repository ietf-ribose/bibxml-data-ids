    <abstract>
      <t>With the advent of RFC8950, Internet Exchang Points (IXPs) are enabled to rely solely on IPv6 addresses for adressing in their peering LANs. However, routers not supporting RFC8950 are a technical roadblock. It is easier to extend the capabilities of the IXP Route Server (RS) instead of those of every unsupporting router. Thus, this document introduces the concept of Specific Local Address Tables (SLATs). SLATs translate BGP next hops between all IXP members, regardless of their RFC8950 support, paving the way for IPv6-only IXPs. This document also introduces another, more transparent variant of BGP next hop translation applicable in IXPs which do not employ ARP and ND proxying. This document updates RFC 6890 by registering a special-purpose address, and RFC 7947 by specifying an allowed route modification at the route server.</t>
