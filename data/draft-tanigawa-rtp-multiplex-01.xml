      <t>This document proposes a simple voice stream multiplexing method which isdesigned to reduce the IP-UDP header overhead of RTP (real-time transportprotocol) streams and to decrease the number of packets in the end-to-endtransport functions. The proposed multiplexing method is to concatenateRTP packets destined for the same Internet Telephony Gateway (IP-GW) intoa single UDP packet. The benefits of this method are that no newadditional headers are required and the current well-defined H.323 andRTP standards can be used. Furthermore, this method is a general RTP packet multiplexing method thatis applicable not only to an IP-GW but also to other multiplexingapplications, as well as trunking VoIP streams application with insertionand deletion of RTP streams on the way.</t>
