    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a simple voice stream multiplexing method which is designed to reduce the IP-UDP header overhead of RTP (real-time transport protocol) streams and to decrease the number of packets in the end-to-end transport functions. The proposed multiplexing method is to concatenate RTP packets destined for the same Internet Telephony Gateway (IP-GW) into a single UDP packet. The benefits of this method are that no new additional headers are required and the current well-defined H.323 and RTP standards can be used. Furthermore, this method is a general RTP packet multiplexing method that is applicable not only to an IP-GW but also to other multiplexing applications, as well as trunking VoIP streams application with insertion and deletion of RTP streams on the way.</t>
