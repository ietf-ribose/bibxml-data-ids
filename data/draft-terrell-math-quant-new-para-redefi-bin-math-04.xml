      <t>This paper provides the Mathematics for the New Paradigm Definingthe Binary System. Furthermore, while the Mathematical foundationand Logical justification, which established the New Structure forthe BINARY SYSTEM, were derived from The Mathematics ofQuantification. The Mathematics itself, which is used in the NewBinary System however, while providing the viable justification andthe logical reasons that supports the change for the New Binary Model,is not quite so new. In fact, it can be said that the Mathematics ofQuantification sustains a Cascading Effect, Producing a Profound Changein the Mathematics for the Entire Mathematical Field. But, the Mathematics for the New Binary System has a Historical Foundation, which dates to the beginnings of Mathematics itself.</t>
