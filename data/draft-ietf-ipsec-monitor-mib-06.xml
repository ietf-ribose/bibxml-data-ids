      <t>This document defines low level monitoring and status MIBs for IPsec security associations (SAs). It does not define MIBs that may be used for configuring IPsec implementations or for providing low-level diagnostic or debugging information. It assumes no specific use of IPsec. Further, it does not provide policy information. The purpose of the MIBs is to allow system administrators to determine operating conditions and perform system operational level monitoring of the IPsec portion of their network. Statistics are provided as well. Additionally, it may be used as the basis for application specific MIBs for specific uses of IPsec SAs.</t>
