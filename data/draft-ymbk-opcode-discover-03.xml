      <t>The QUERY opcode in the DNS is designed for unicast. With the development of multicast capabilities in the DNS, it is desireableto have a more robust opcode for server interactions since a singlerequest may result in replies from multiple responders. So DISCOVERis defined to deal with replies from multiple responders.As such, this document extend the core DNS specifications to allowclients to have a method for coping with replies from multipleresponders. Use of this new opcode may facilitate DNS operations inmodern networking topologies. A prototype of the DISCOVER opcodewas developed as part of the TBDS project, funded under DARPA grantF30602-99-1-0523.</t>
