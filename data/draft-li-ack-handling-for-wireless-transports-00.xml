    <abstract>
      <t>Acknowledgement (ACK) is a basic function and implemented in most of the ordered and reliable transport protocols [RFC0793]. Traditional ACK is designed with high frequency to guarantee correct interaction between sender and receiver. Delayed byte-counting ACK or periodic ACK with large interval are proposed in prior work to reduce ACK intensity. High-throughput transport over wireless local area network (WLAN) becomes a demanding requirement with the emergence of 4K wireless projection, VR/AR-based interactive gaming, and more. However, the interference nature of the wireless medium induces an unavoidable contention between data transport and backward signaling, such as acknowledgement. This document presents the problems caused by high-intensity ACK in WLAN. We also analyze the possibility of ACK optimization in WLAN and the compatibility issues with existing systems.</t>
