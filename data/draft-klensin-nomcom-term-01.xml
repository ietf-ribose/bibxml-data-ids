      <t>A consensus is emerging in the IETF that very long tenure inleadership roles is not in the best interests of the community.While, in theory, that advice could simply be given to the NomCom,there is reason to believe that a different model for considerationof renewal or replacement for members of the leadership would be moreefficient for the NomCom and would impose less hardship on incumbentsand the community. This document outlines that alternate method.</t>
