      <t>To build digital twin networks based on the digital twin network architecture in [DTNConcept], modeling of digital twins and virtual- physical mapping are critical. There are many ways to construct network twins, and they have different ways to realize virtual- physical mapping and information exchange between twins. Constructing a twin of network element that has communication requirement and function like a physical entity is a kind of network modeling. In this scenario, when implementing virtual-physical mapping and information exchange between twins based on network layer communication, It faces problems such as large addressing space consumption and low addressing efficiency. This document describes an idea to using flexible addressing and protocol techniques in digital twin network architecture that can help reduce the complexity of digital twin network implementations and improve digital twin network efficiency and security.</t>
