      <t>This document provides a problem statement for simultaneous mobility in an infrastructure-based mobility environment. It considers what the simultaneous mobility problem is and describes the conditions under which it may occur. It also illustrates the occurrence of the simultaneous mobility problem in the context of different mobility protocols such as Mobile IPv6. The simultaneous mobility problem defined here is strictly applied to scenarios when the intermediary nodes in the core are not mobile.</t>
