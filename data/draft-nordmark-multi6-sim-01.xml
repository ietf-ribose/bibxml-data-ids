      <t>This document contains a rough outline of a potential solution toIPv6 multihoming in order to stimulate discussion.This proposed solution uses 126 bit identifiers which are hashes ofpublic keys (know as Cryptographically-based Identifiers) which arecreated in an autonomous fashion by every node. When there is a needto verify whether a new locator should be used with an identifierthan a public-key based challenge-response is used.The proposal allows locator rewriting by (border) routers, andensures that the upper layer protocols can operate unmodified in amultihomed setting using the stable identifiers.</t>
