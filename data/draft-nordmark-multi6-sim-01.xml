      <t>This document contains a rough outline of a potential solution to IPv6 multihoming in order to stimulate discussion. This proposed solution uses 126 bit identifiers which are hashes of public keys (know as Cryptographically-based Identifiers) which are created in an autonomous fashion by every node. When there is a need to verify whether a new locator should be used with an identifier than a public-key based challenge-response is used. The proposal allows locator rewriting by (border) routers, and ensures that the upper layer protocols can operate unmodified in a multihomed setting using the stable identifiers.</t>
