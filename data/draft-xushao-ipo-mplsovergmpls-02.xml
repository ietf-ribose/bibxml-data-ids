      <t>MPLS over GMPLS-based optical networks (MPLS over GMPLS) is a subset of IP over optical networks. To be more specific, in this draft it refers to the technology of interconnection between MPLS networks and GMPLS-based optical networks with an overlay model or an interdomain model. It is an important milestone in the evolutionary roadmap from IP over static WDM to a peer model of network interconnections. The most significant feature of the requirements for MPLS over GMPLS is a much more dynamic interface between the two layers. The draft discusses the evolutionary roadmap of IP over optical networks and then highlights the significance of the concept of MPLS over GMPLS. Some new requirements will be identified, including multi-lightpath connections, MPLS network topology dynamic changes and dynamic traffic grooming and so on. It is these requirements that bring some challenges to the present routing, signaling and UNI protocols.</t>
