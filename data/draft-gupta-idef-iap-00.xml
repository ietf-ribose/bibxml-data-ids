      <t>The Intrusion Alert Protocol (IAP) is an application--level protocol for exchanging intrusion alert data between intrusion detection elements, notably sensor/analyzers and managers in IP networks. The protocol is designed to be independent of the type of data representation. The data definition and formatting model for alerts is described in companion documents of the working group.</t>
