      <t>The rules for SIP proxies are organized so that when a UAC sends anout-of-dialog request, even if the request is forked to a number ofUASs, (usually) only one UAS will accept the request, and only thefinal response from that UAS will be returned to the UAC. Thisforking mechanism is optimal for an INVITE intended to connect onehuman user with another human uses, but is poor for requests thathave a "one to many" nature, especially PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBErequests, but also including some INVITEs. This document proposes analternative forking mechanism that better supports "one to many"requests, and that mechanism be the standardized meaning of the(existing but weakly specified) "Request-Disposition: no-cancel,parallel" header.</t>
