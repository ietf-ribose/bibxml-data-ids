      <t>The requirements for MPLS Transport Profile include a requirement (R93) that requires that MPLS-TP must support recovery mechanisms for a network constructed from interconnected rings that protect user data that traverses more than one ring. In particular, this includes protecting against cases of failure at the ring interconnect nodes and links. This document presents different configurations of interconnected rings and special mechanisms to address the recovery of ring-interconnect nodes and links. . This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</t>
