    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a hybrid naming scheme for unifying all kinds of information including resources, services and data. As many proposals of novel network architectures emerge, such as DONA, ICN, NDN, the location-based routing starts to transfer to the content-based ones. Currently, it is incompatible that many different information naming schemes are adopted in different network proposals, respectively, i.e. flat names in DONA, hierarchical names in NDN. The proposed naming scheme adopts a hybrid naming structure including hierarchical component, flat component and attribute component. The hybrid naming (hn) scheme enables to identify different routing information uniformly, and provides great compatibility and advantages.</t>
