      <t>This document describes those features of a service which processes signed doucments which must be present in order for that service to constitute a 'technical non-repudiation' service. A technical non-repudiation service must permit an independent verifier to determine whether a given signature was applied to a given data object by the private key associated with a given valid certificate, at a time later than the signature. The features of a technical non-repudiation service are expected to be necessary for a full non-repudiation service, although they may not be sufficient. This document is intended to clarify the definition of the 'non-repudiation' service in RFC 2459. It should thus serve as a guide to when the nonRepudiation bit of the keyUsage extension should be used and to when a Certificate Authority is required to archive CRL's.</t>
