      <t>This document describes those features of a service which processessigned doucments which must be present in order for that service toconstitute a 'technical non-repudiation' service. A technicalnon-repudiation service must permit an independent verifier todetermine whether a given signature was applied to a given data objectby the private key associated with a given valid certificate, at a timelater than the signature. The features of a technical non-repudiationservice are expected to be necessary for a full non-repudiation service,although they may not be sufficient.This document is intended to clarify the definition of the'non-repudiation' service in RFC 2459. It should thus serve as a guideto when the nonRepudiation bit of the keyUsage extension should be usedand to when a Certificate Authority is required to archive CRL's.</t>
