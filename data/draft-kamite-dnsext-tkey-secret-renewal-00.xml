      <t>TKEY [RFC2930] provides methods of setting up shared secret keys for TSIG [RFC2845] other than manual exchange. But TKEY itself cannot control timing of key renewal very well though it can add or delete shared keys. Since continuing to sign messages with old keys permanently is not safe, hosts which make use of TSIG should pay attention to the time limit of secret usage.</t>
