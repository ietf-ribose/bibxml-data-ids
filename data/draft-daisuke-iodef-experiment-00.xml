      <t>This document explains our observation on the usability of IODEF [RFC5070], based on our experiments. We aim at developing an IODEF- capable incident response management systems in order to facilitate incident response activities. We started to design and implement the system for our university CERT, however, there are several technical issues while implementing and operating the system. This document shares the observation from our proto-type implementation and provides new sight from operational aspects.</t>
