      <t>Tag Switching and Cell Switch Router are layer integration technologies between L2 and L3 to provide high-speed cut-through mechanisms for L3 packet transfer by mapping between L3 and L2 datagram labels. TDP and FANP, used in Tag Switching and Cell Switch Router, respectively, are protocols that notify the mapping information between peer routers. Although the objectives of both technologies are the same, there are several differences in methods for achieving the objective. This memo compares the two technologies and discusses how to merge them.</t>
