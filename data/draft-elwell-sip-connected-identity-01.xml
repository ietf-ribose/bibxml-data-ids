      <t>Because of retargeting of a dialog-forming request, the UAS can havea different identity from that in the To header. This documentprovides a means for that UA to supply its identity to the peer UA bymeans of a request in the reverse direction and for that identity tobe signed by an authentication service. The same mechanism can beused to indicate a change of identity during a dialog, e.g., becauseof some action in a PSTN behind a gateway.This work is being discussed on the sip@ietf.org mailing list.</t>
