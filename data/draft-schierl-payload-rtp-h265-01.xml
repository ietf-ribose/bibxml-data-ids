      <t>This memo describes an RTP payload format for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) [HEVC], which is currently being developed by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC). The RTP payload format allows for packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL) units in each RTP packet payload, as well as fragmentation of a NAL unit into multiple RTP packets. Furthermore, it supports transmission of an HEVC stream over a single as well as multiple RTP flows. The payload format has wide applicability in videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high bit-rate entertainment-quality video, among others.</t>
