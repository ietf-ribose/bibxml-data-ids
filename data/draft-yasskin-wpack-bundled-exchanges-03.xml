      <t>Web bundles provide a way to bundle up groups of HTTP responses, with the URLs and request URLs that produced them, to transmit or store them together. They can include multiple top-level resources with one identified as the default by a primaryUrl metadata, provide random access to their component exchanges, and efficiently store 8-bit resources.</t>
