    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an intelligent reinforcement learning agent system to autonomously manage agent path-planning over a communication network. The main centralized node called by the global environment should not only manage all agents workflow in a hybrid peer-to-peer networking architecture and, but transfer and share information in distributed nodes. All agents in distributed nodes are able to be provided with a cumulative reward for each action that a given agent takes with respect to an optimized knowledge based on a to-be-learned policy over the learning process. A reward from the global environment is reflected to the next optimized action for autonomous path management in distributed networking nodes.</t>
