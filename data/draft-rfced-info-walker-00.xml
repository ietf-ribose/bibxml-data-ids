      <t>This memo is a first attempt at providing guidance on how to deal with the perplexity of new LAN and WAN site installs. Experienced and less experienced network engineers often do each installation blindly without any form or fashion. This document is an attempt to document specific install issues, practices and procedures. It is also intended to be a future installation reference handbook. Please email me with any comments or additional items that may have been overlooked. Hopefully you will see this as a starting point to collect data for the site installation that you are completing.</t>
