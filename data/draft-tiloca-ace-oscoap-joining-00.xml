      <t>This document describes a method to join a multicast group where communications are based on CoAP and secured with Object Security of CoAP (OSCOAP). The proposed method delegates the authentication and authorization of client nodes that join a multicast group through a Group Manager server. This approach builds on the ACE framework for Authentication and Authorization, and leverages protocol-specific profiles of ACE to achieve communication security, proof-of- possession and server authentication.</t>
