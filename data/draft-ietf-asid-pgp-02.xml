      <t>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) as definied by [1] is a high security cryptographic software application for MSDOS, Unix, VAX/VMS, MacOS and other operating systems. There is a need to store public PGPkeys in the X.500 [2,3] Directory as a means to ease the publication of public keys, and thereby the use of PGP as a cryptographic system. This document builds on the experimentation to date and defines four new attribute types and an auxiliary object class to allow PGP keys to be included in X.500 Directory entries in a standard way. It is intended that the schema elements defined in this document will be progressed according to the process defined by the Internet X.500 Schema Working Group [4].</t>
