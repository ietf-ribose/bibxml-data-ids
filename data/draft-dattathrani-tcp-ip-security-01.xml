      <t>The security problems in the internet are due to inherent problems in the TCP/IP stack. The purpose of this draft is to brief on some of the measures to prevent security attacks in TCP/IP network, by changing some of the ways in which the TCP/IP protocol stack works. The security attacks which are addressed in this draft are: 1) ARP(Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing and MAC address cloning 2) TCP Initial sequence number prediction This version offers backward compatibility with cards that do not support the security features mentioned in this draft. In view of this, changes have been made to section 2.3 and a new section (Section 2.4) has been added.</t>
