      <t>The shim6 protocol defines a header that contains a "context tag" thatidentifies packets as belonging to a certain shim6 context that existsbetween two hosts. It has been suggested that this shim6 header isinserted between the IPv6 header and the upper layer protocol such asTCP in all packets where the shim layer has rewritten the source and/ordestination address. This document considers the suppression of thisheader in situations where packets can be successfully demultiplexed bythe receiver without it.</t>
