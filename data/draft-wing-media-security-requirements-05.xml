      <t>A number of proposals have been published to address the need of securing media traffic. A summary of the proposals available at that time is available in the appendix of this document. Different assumptions, requirements, and usage environments justify every one of them. This document aims to summarize the discussed media security requirements. A comparison of the requirements against the individual proposals is provided. This document is discussed on the SIP mailing list, &lt;http://www1.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/sip&gt;.</t>
