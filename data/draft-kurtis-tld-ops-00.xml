      <t>The Internet is today the defacto standard packet network for a lot of critical communications. The Internet in turn have a heavy dependency on the Domain Name System (DNS) for it's "normal" operations. The IETF in June 2000 described the operating requirements [1]for the so called root-servers that defines the root of the DNS lookup tree.

This document analyses these requirements and what can be done to ensure a reliable DNS infrastructure.</t>
