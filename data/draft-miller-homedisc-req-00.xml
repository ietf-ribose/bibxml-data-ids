    <abstract>
      <t>Networks in the home and similar environments typically do not have, and should not be expected to have a full range of network services such as DHCP servers, DNS and the like. Further, networks in the home and similar environments may have only occasional connectivity to a larger network such as the Internet where these types of services may exist. Typical users of home networks may not have the skills or desire to install, configure, administer and maintain a sophisticated home network. To enable the effective use of networks in the home and similar environments, methods for discovering devices and services in the network are needed. These methods need to work for occasionally connected and often resource-poor networks such as are typically found in the home. These methods also need to be self-configuring, requiring only minimal involvement of users of a home or similar network to configure and maintain that network. This document presents requirements for the discovery of devices and services in a home network or similar environment. These requirements are intended to form a basis that enables further work toward solutions in this area.</t>
