      <t>This document specifies a variant of the Mobility Support in IPv6protocol [1], mainly intended for mobile hosts that do not need toor want to use any explicit home agent. However, portions of theprotocol may be beneficial for other hosts as well, includingnon-mobile hosts, since it reduces the average header sizes forpackets flowing between two mobile hosts or between a mobile and anon-mobile host. It may also be beneficial to multi-homed hosts orsites, since it allows migration of connections from one IP addressto another.</t>
