      <t>The IPv6 addressing architecture specifies formats for unicast addresses, but provides no operational guidelines for their use. There is a clear need for IPv6 to support organizational-scope communications whether members of the organization are located in the same site or different sites. Aspects of certain types of sites introduce challenges for supporting organizational-scope communications. Of special interest are nomadic sites, e.g., sites that are intermittently-connected or disconnected from the global Internet, sites that frequently change provider points of attachment, sites that temporarily or permanently merge with other sites, etc. This memo will discuss scenarios and goals for IPv6 support organizational-scope communications.</t>
