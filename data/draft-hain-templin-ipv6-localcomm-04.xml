      <t>The IPv6 addressing architecture specifies formats for unicastaddresses, but provides no operational guidelines for their use.There is a clear need for IPv6 to support organizational-scopecommunications whether members of the organization are located in thesame site or different sites.Aspects of certain types of sites introduce challenges for supportingorganizational-scope communications. Of special interest are nomadicsites, e.g., sites that are intermittently-connected or disconnectedfrom the global Internet, sites that frequently change providerpoints of attachment, sites that temporarily or permanently mergewith other sites, etc. This memo will discuss scenarios and goals forIPv6 support organizational-scope communications.</t>
