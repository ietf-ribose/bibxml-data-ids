      <t>IPv6 Subnet Anycast is not used operationally, complicates implementations, and complicates protocol specifications. The form of anycast actually used in the Internet is routing-based, and is essentilly the same as that of IPv4 anycast. Therefore, this document deprecates IPv6 Subnet Anycast. This is an early draft and will require non-trivial fill-in and details.</t>
