      <t>This document provides both a functional description and a detailed specification of the Temporally-Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA)--a distributed routing protocol for multihop networks. A key concept in the protocol's design is an attempt to de-couple the generation of far-reaching control message propagation from the dynamics of the network topology. The basic, underlying algorithm is neither distance-vector nor link-state; it is a member of a class referred to as link-reversal algorithms. The protocol builds a loop-free, multipath routing structure that is used as the basis for forwarding traffic to a given destination. The protocol can simultaneously support both source-initiated, on-demand routing for some destinations and destination-initiated, proactive routing for other destinations.</t>
