      <t>This document provides both a functional description and a detailedspecification of the Temporally-Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA)--adistributed routing protocol for multihop networks. A key concept inthe protocol's design is an attempt to de-couple the generation offar-reaching control message propagation from the dynamics of thenetwork topology. The basic, underlying algorithm is neitherdistance-vector nor link-state; it is a member of a class referred toas link-reversal algorithms. The protocol builds a loop-free,multipath routing structure that is used as the basis for forwardingtraffic to a given destination. The protocol can simultaneouslysupport both source-initiated, on-demand routing for somedestinations and destination-initiated, proactive routing for otherdestinations.</t>
