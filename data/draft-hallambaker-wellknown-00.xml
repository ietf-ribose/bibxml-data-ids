      <t>Under the current system of registration, separate requests are required to register entries for .well-known HTTP services, discovery via DNS mechanisms such as SRV and NAPTR and for a URI prefix. This proposal encourages Web Services to adopt a consistent approach to configuration through a 'one stop' registration system whereby assignment of a .well-known identifier automatically assigns DNS and URI prefixes.</t>
