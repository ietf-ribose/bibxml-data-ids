      <t>There are several scenarios involving multi-hop heterogeneous wireless networks requiring reliable and available features combined with multi-access edge computing, such as Industry 4.0. This document discusses mechanisms to allow a terminal influencing the selection of a MEC host for instantiation of the terminal-targeted MEC applications and functions, and (re)configuring the RAW network lying in between the terminal and the selected MEC host. This document assumes IETF RAW and ETSI MEC integration, fostering discussion about extensions at both IETF and ETSI MEC to better support these scenarios.</t>
