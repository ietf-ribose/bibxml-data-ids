      <t>This document describes the architecture for Service Assurance for Intent-based Networking (SAIN). This architecture aims at assuring that service instances are correctly running. As services rely on multiple sub-services by the underlying network devices, getting the assurance of a healthy service is only possible with a holistic view of network devices. This architecture not only helps to correlate the service degradation with the network root cause but also the impacted services impacted when a network component fails or degrades.</t>
