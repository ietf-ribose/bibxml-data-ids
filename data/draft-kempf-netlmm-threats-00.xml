      <t>This document discusses security threats to NETLMM-based mobilitymanagement with a focus on threats on the interface between mobilenodes and access routers. Threats to the NETLMM protocol itself,which runs between the access routers and mobility anchor points, aresimilar to those faced by other protocols between network entitieslike routers. These threats are handled in the NETLMM protocolspecification. In contrast, threats on the interface between mobilenodes and access routers are different, because the access routersare presenting the NETLMM domain as a single subnet, in order toallow mobile nodes to continue using the same IP address as they movefrom one access router to another.</t>
