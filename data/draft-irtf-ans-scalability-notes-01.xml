      <t>This document provides a working definition of 'absolute scalability' and 'weak scalability' of a method of an ad hoc network, and also a way of comparing the scalability of two different methods. A method may be a protocol, an algorithm, or a scheme whose scalability needs to be evaluated. For example, it may be a routing protocol or a MAC protocol. 'Absolute scalability' emphasizes the asymptotic behavior of a set of metrics, which define the efficiency of the network as a network parameter tends to infinity. 'Weak scalability' refers to the comparison of the metrics over a given range. Finally, fairness in the comparison of these metrics is discussed.</t>
