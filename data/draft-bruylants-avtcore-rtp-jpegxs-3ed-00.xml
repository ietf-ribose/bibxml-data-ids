    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) payload format to be used for transporting video encoded with JPEG XS (ISO/ IEC 21122). JPEG XS is a low-latency, lightweight image coding system. Compared to an uncompressed video use case, it allows higher resolutions and video frame rates while offering visually lossless quality, reduced power consumption, and encoding-decoding latency confined to a fraction of a video frame. This document is a necessary revision of RFC9134 to add support for new features introduced by the 3rd edition of JPEG XS. It obsoletes RFC9134 but the revised payload format is designed such that existing compliant implementations of RFC9134 remain valid to the updated payload format. In addition, this document integrates the errata of RFC9134 and provides improvements and clarifications to the text where applicable.</t>
