      <t>A Request-Timeout header is defined for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). This end-to-end header informs an origin server and any intermediaries of the maximum time that a client will await a response to its request. A server can use this header to ensure that a timely response is generated. This also identifies requests as being potentially long-lived, and allows for better resource allocation for these requests. A Connection-Timeout header is defined for HTTP. This hop-by-hop header informs the entity at the other end of a connection of the maximum time that an idle connection is kept open. This header improves reliability by providing better information about the idle connection management policy of HTTP hosts.</t>
