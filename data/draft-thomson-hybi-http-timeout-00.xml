      <t>A Request-Timeout header is defined for Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP). This end-to-end header informs an origin server and anyintermediaries of the maximum time that a client will await aresponse to its request. A server can use this header to ensure thata timely response is generated. This also identifies requests asbeing potentially long-lived, and allows for better resourceallocation for these requests.A Connection-Timeout header is defined for HTTP. This hop-by-hopheader informs the entity at the other end of a connection of themaximum time that an idle connection is kept open. This headerimproves reliability by providing better information about the idleconnection management policy of HTTP hosts.</t>
