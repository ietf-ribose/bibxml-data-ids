      <t>This document describes the protocol specification of LIN6. LIN6supports both macro and micro mobility in IPv6[RFC2460]. LIN6 hasseveral advantages in comparison with Mobile IPv6[MIPv6] as follows:o LIN6 has no header overhead because it does not use any extensionheaders of IPv6 while Mobile IPv6 uses the Destination OptionsHeader for the Home Address Option and the Routing Header.o LIN6 is more fault tolerant than Mobile IPv6. In Mobile IPv6, the Home Agent cannot be replicated to the subnet other than the homelink of the mobile node. LIN6 introduces the Mapping Agent whichcan be replicated anywhere in the Internet.o LIN6 keeps end-to-end communication model, that is, LIN6 does notuse any packet intercepter/forwarder such as the Home Agent ofMobile IPv6. There is no tunneling in LIN6.</t>
