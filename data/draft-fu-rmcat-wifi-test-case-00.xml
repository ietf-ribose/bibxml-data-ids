    <abstract>
      <t>Wireless network is becoming the dominiant mode of Internet access nowadays. According to statisics gathered by Cisco regarding usage of interactive real-time interactive media (e.g., video conferencing calls) across different types of clients, 76.12% of the calls are over Wi-Fi networks, 23.84% are over cellular, and only 0.04% are over Ethernet. [Editor's note: need some clarification/reference regarding source of this data]. It is therefore important to evaluate candidate congestion control schemes designed for real-time interactive media over test cases that include Wi-Fi access links. This draft serves such a purpose, and is complementary to [I-D.ietf-rmcat-eval-test] and [I-D.draft-sarker-rmcat-cellular-eval-test-cases]</t>
