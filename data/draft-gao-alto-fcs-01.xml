    <abstract>
      <t>The emergence of new networking datapath capabilities has substantially increased the flexibility of networking. For example, OpenFlow has emerged as a major southbound protocol for Software- Defined Networking, and OpenFlow allows flexible routing beyond simple destination-based routing. In this document, we define a new extention to ALTO, namely the Flow Cost Service, for ALTO clients in an OpenFlow-enabled network to query ALTO network information.</t>
