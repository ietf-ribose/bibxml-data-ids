    <abstract>
      <t>The Postcard-Based Telemetry (PBT) allows network OAM applications to collect telemetry data about any user packet. Unlike the E2E and trace modes in in-situ OAM (IOAM), PBT does not require user packets to carry any telemetry data, but directly exports the telemetry data from network nodes to a collector through separated OAM packets called postcards. Two variations of PBT, PBT-I and PBT-M, are described. PBT-I requires inserting an instruction header to user packets to guide the data collection. PBT-I is designed as another mode of IOAM, Per-Hop Postcard (PHP), to complement the existing operational modes of IOAM. PBT-M only marks the user packets or configure the flow filter to invoke the data collection. PBT-M also provides a complement to IOAM and address several implementation and deployment challenges of it.</t>
