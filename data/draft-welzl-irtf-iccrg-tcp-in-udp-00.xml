    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a method to encapsulate multiple TCP connections using only one UDP port number pair. Doing so allows for a relatively easy implementation of coupled congestion control for the TCP connections. This can have several performance benefits, and it makes it possible to precisely assign a share of the congestion window to the connections based on priorities. It also enables use of UDP-based NAT traversal techniques, and it can act as a framework for experimentation with novel changes to the TCP standard.</t>
