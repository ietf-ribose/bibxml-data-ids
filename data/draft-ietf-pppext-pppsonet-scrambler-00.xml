      <t>This Internet Draft addresses the PPP/SONET interface definedin the IETF RFC 1619 and its application in public Internet backbonenetworks. By experimental analysis it is found that this SONET interfacespecification is deficient in providing payload transparency. Thisdeficiency leads to deleterious effects in providing reliable networkoperations. A simple SONET payload scrambler enhancement is proposed to overcome this deficiency. This work has been brought to theANSI T1X1.5 as an action item for the addition of the RFC 1619 mappingto T1.105 with a scrambler to be determined by T1X1. We are submitting the same proposal to IETF now with the interest toenhance RFC-1619 accordingly and achieve alignment with ANSI T1 standards.To facilitate this alignment, we have recommended that T1X1 establish aformal liaison with IETF in regard to IP/SONET interface standardsand associated IP transmission standards development.</t>
