    <title>PPP over SONET/SDH</title>
    <date year="1997" month="October" day="16"/>
    <abstract>
      <t>This Internet Draft addresses the PPP/SONET interface defined in the IETF RFC 1619 and its application in public Internet backbone networks. By experimental analysis it is found that this SONET interface specification is deficient in providing payload transparency. This deficiency leads to deleterious effects in providing reliable network operations. A simple SONET payload scrambler enhancement is proposed to overcome this deficiency. This work has been brought to the ANSI T1X1.5 as an action item for the addition of the RFC 1619 mapping to T1.105 with a scrambler to be determined by T1X1. We are submitting the same proposal to IETF now with the interest to enhance RFC-1619 accordingly and achieve alignment with ANSI T1 standards. To facilitate this alignment, we have recommended that T1X1 establish a formal liaison with IETF in regard to IP/SONET interface standards and associated IP transmission standards development.</t>
