    <abstract>
      <t>A generic Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) solution is specified for Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree) services which uses VLANs to indicate root or leaf traffic. A VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model is illustrated as an example for the solution. In the solution, E-Tree VPLS PEs are interconnected by PWs which carry the VLAN indicating the E-Tree attribute, the MAC address based Ethernet forwarding engine and the PW work in the same way as before. A signaling mechanism for E-Tree capability and VLAN mapping negotiation is further described.</t>
