    <abstract>
      <t>The computing intensive parts of the customer premise equipment have been decoupled and migrated to the cloud, therefore the thin CPE remaining at customer premise needs to access its “avatar” virtual CPE in the cloud which could be deployed in multiple edge computing sites. This draft will illustrate a use case of L2 traffic steering in terms of dynamic computing and networking resource status, together with requirements for CATS as well as solution consideration with regard to particularly the difference from the L3 routing framework.</t>
