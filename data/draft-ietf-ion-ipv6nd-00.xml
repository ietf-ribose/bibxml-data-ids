      <t>This document attempts to describe and summarize some current proposals for running IPv6 over ATM, and identifies open issues that require resolution by one or more IETF working groups. The frame formats for unicast and multicast transmission of IPv6 packets in a UNI3.1 based ATM environment are specified. Some issues regarding the construction of IPv6 link-local addresses are identified, and a proposal made. A format for source and target link-layer address options in Neighbor Discovery messages is suggested, and the interactions between IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and existing IP over ATM models are outlined. This revision looks at the three models that were presented at the Los Angeles IETF in March 1996, in a joint session of the IPATM, IPNG, and ROLC working groups. No firm decisions were made at this joint meeting. Readers are encouraged to locate and review the Internet Drafts describing each model in greater detail. Further discussion of the issues raised in this document is requested, as not all questions are currently answered satisfactorily.</t>
