      <t>RFC 2026 places restrictions on how Internet-Drafts can be referred to in RFCs. Over time, the way that the IETF community uses Internet-Drafts has changed. The restrictions from RFC 2026 sometimes make RFCs inaccurate (because many drafts that are referred to are not actually "works in progress", and also make references to Internet-Drafts nearly useless to RFC readers. This document updates the one part of RFC 2026, and the one part of RFC 7322, that covers referencing Internet-Drafts.</t>
