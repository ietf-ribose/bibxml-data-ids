      <t>DNS-Based Service Discovery allows clients to discover available services using unicast DNS queries. In simple configurations these unicast DNS queries go directly to the appropriate authoritative server(s). In large networks that have complicated topology, or many client devices, or both, it can be advantageous to have an intermediary between the clients and authoritative servers. This intermediary, called a Discovery Broker, serves several purposes. A Discovery Broker can reduce load on both the servers and the clients, and gives the option of presenting clients with service discovery organized around logical, rather than physical, topology.</t>
