      <t>The Message Session Relay Protocol(MSRP) does not allow privacy andtopology hiding, such that MSRP users can hide the IP Address oftheir systems. This limitation is due to the fact that MSRP Pathheaders contain physical IP addresses. This document describes amechanism which adds a level of indirection to allow privacy andtopology hiding, to prevent remote parties and a man-in-the-middlefrom learning the IP Address and port information of the MSRP client.It also defines the option tag msrp-opaque, to indicate such support.</t>
