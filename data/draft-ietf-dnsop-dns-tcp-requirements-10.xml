    <abstract>
      <t>This document updates [RFC1123]. This document strongly encourages the operational practice of permitting DNS messages to be carried over TCP on the Internet as a best current practice. Such encouragement is aligned with the implementation requirements in RFC 7766. The use of TCP includes both DNS over unencrypted TCP, as well as over an encrypted TLS session. The document also considers the consequences with this form of DNS communication and the potential operational issues that can arise when this best current practice is not upheld.</t>
