      <t>One of the key features of IP that has helped IP Routing to scale is aggregation of IP prefixes. This is made possible with longest-match lookup in IP forwarding. Contrary to this, MPLS forwarding works on exact match on MPLS labels. This poses a challenge in aggregation of IP prefixes when the forwarding is based on the MPLS labels associated with those IP prefixes. This document introduces an Aggregation Segment for Segment Routing with MPLS data plane which can be used to aggregate IP prefixes along with their SR Prefix Segments. Aggregation Segments enable aggregation of IP prefixes to be performed at border routers to improve scalability of MPLS networks.</t>
