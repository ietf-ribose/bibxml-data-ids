      <t>Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such aspieces of information or server processes, which are available inseveral equivalent replicas on different hosts. This includes, butis not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications. The goalof Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provideguidance to applications, which have to select one or several hostsfrom a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desiredresource. This guidance shall be based on parameters that affectperformance and efficiency of the data transmission between thehosts, e.g., the topological distance. The ultimate goal is toimprove performance (or Quality of Experience) in the applicationwhile reducing resource consumption in the underlying networkinfrastructure.This document enumerates requirements for ALTO, which should beconsidered when specifying, assessing, or comparing protocols andimplementations, and it solicits feedback and discussion.</t>
