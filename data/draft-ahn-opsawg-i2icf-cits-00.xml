    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a structured framework for orchestrating, managing, and monitoring In-Network Computing Functions (ICFs) in Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS). For example, in the context of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, efficient management of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications and their integration with C-ITS can greatly benefit from in-network computing. By leveraging ICFs, it becomes possible to optimize real- time communication, streamline traffic management, and enhance data processing and security services at the network edge.</t>
