      <t>We propose the addition of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) together with congestion signaling back to the ingress in order to provide notification to the ingress label switching router (LSR) if congestion is experienced along a label switched path (LSP). This information could be used by the ingress LSR to mitigate congestion by employing dynamic traffic engineering techniques such as shifting flows to alternate paths.</t>
