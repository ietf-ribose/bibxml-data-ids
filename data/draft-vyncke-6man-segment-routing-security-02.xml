      <t>Segment Routing (SR) allows a node to steer a packet through a controlled set of instructions, called segments, by prepending a SR header to the packet. A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service-based. SR allows to enforce a flow through any path (topological, or application/service based) while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node to the SR domain. Segment Routing can be applied to the IPv6 data plane with the addition of a new type of Routing Extension Header. This document analyzes the security aspects of the Segment Routing Extension Header (SRH) and how it is used by SR capable nodes to deliver a secure service.</t>
