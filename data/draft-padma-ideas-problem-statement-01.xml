    <abstract>
      <t>The forthcoming deployment of 5G coupled with emerging applications such as augmented reality, virtual reality and 8k videos are likely to raise more stringent requirements in terms of ultra-low latency while ensuring session continuity. The emergence of IoT services also raises new challenges (with respect to their interoperability, discovery, naming and addressing) which may lead to identity-based designs. This problem statement examines how the existing solutions for networks whose forwarding scheme assumes the decoupling between the identifier and the locator information (called Identity Enabled Networks) will struggle to meet such requirements. It advocates for a standardized, secured common control plane with data integrity for Identity Services such as identifier registration, mapping and resolution. This memo also identifies several key areas to be further investigated for the architecture design of these services.</t>
