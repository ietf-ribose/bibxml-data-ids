      <t>When SIP entities use a connection oriented protocol to send a request, they typically originate their connections from an ephemeral port. The SIP protocol includes mechanisms which insure that responses to a request, and new requests sent in original direction reuse an existing connection. However, new requests sent in the opposite direction are unlikely to reuse the existing connection. This frequently causes a pair of SIP entities to use one connection for requests sent in each direction, and can result in potential scaling and performance problems. This document presents requirements for addressing this shortcoming, and separately proposes an example mechanism which addresses this deficiency.</t>
