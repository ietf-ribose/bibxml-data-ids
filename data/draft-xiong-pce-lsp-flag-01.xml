      <t>RFC8231 describes a set of extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of MPLS-TE and GMPLS Label Switched Paths(LSPs) via PCEP. One of the extensions is the LSP object which includes a Flag field and the length is 12 bits. However, 11 bits of the Flag field has been assigned in RFC8231, RFC8281 and RFC8623 respectively. This document proposes to define a new LSP-EXTENDED-FLAG TLV for LSP object to extend the length of the flags.</t>
