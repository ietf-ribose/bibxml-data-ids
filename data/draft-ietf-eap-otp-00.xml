      <t>EAP is an authentication protocol which supports multiple authenticationmechanisms. EAP typically runs directly over the link layer withoutrequiring IP and therefore includes its own support for in-orderdelivery and re-transmission. While EAP was originally developed for usewith PPP, it is also now in use with IEEE 802. This document defines theOne Time Password (OTP) and Generic Token Card EAP methods, both ofwhich provide one-way authentication, but not key generation. As aresult, the OTP and Generic Token Card methods, when used by themselves,are only appropriate for use on networks where physical security can beassumed. These methods SHOULD NOT be used on wireless networks, or overthe Internet, unless the EAP conversation is protected. This can beaccomplished using technologies such as IPsec or TLS.</t>
