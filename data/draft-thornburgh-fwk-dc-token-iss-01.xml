      <t>This memo describes a protocol framework for HTTP clients to obtain bearer tokens for accessing restricted resources, where in some applications the client may not have prior knowledge of, or a direct relationship with, the resource server's authorization infrastructure (such as in decentralized identity systems). Semi-concrete applications of the framework using proof-of-possession and TLS client certificate mechanisms are also described.</t>
