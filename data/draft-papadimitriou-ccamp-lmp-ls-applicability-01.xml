      <t>Integration of Generalized MPLS-capable SONET/SDH networks inexisting backbone environments has generated the need to determineinter-working capabilities between nodes interconnected by bothSONET/SDH and non-SONET/SDH overhead terminating networks. This isparticularly the case for critical functions and applications suchas the ones provided by the Link Management Protocol [LMP] and itsWDM extensions [LMP-WDM]. In this context, this document describesthe applicability of their respective functions and illustrates themthrough several inter-connection architectures.</t>
