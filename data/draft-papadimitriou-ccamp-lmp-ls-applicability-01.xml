    <abstract>
      <t>Integration of Generalized MPLS-capable SONET/SDH networks in existing backbone environments has generated the need to determine inter-working capabilities between nodes interconnected by both SONET/SDH and non-SONET/SDH overhead terminating networks. This is particularly the case for critical functions and applications such as the ones provided by the Link Management Protocol [LMP] and its WDM extensions [LMP-WDM]. In this context, this document describes the applicability of their respective functions and illustrates them through several inter-connection architectures.</t>
