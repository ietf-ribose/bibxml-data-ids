    <abstract>
      <t>In transport networks, there are requirements where reverse unidirectional LSP of a bidirectional LSP needs to follow the same path as its forward unidirectional LSP. This document describes how RSVP Extended ASSOCIATION Object can be used to bind two co-routed point-to-point unidirectional LSPs into an associated co-routed bidirectional LSP in single-sided provisioning case. The RSVP REVERSE_LSP Object is used to enable an endpoint to trigger creation of the reverse LSP along the same path as the forward LSP. Fast-reroute procedures to ensure that the traffic flows on the co- routed path after a failure event are also described.</t>
