      <t>The Mobile IPv6 protocol is being adopted by various StandardsDevelopment Organizations (SDO) for mobility across wide areanetworks. Some of the architectures developed by these SDOs requiresome of the access links to be home link for mobile node. The beliefis that if the mobile node thinks it is attached to the home link,there will not be additional packet overhead due to Mobile IPv6tunneling. Many of these links where the mobile node is supposed tobe attached to the home link are point-to-point links. There aresome issues with making these point-to-point links appear like homelink to the mobile node. This document captures some of the issuesrelated to this, and analyzes possible solutions.</t>
