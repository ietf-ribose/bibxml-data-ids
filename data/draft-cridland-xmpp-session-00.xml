    <abstract>
      <t>The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) historically had a Session Establishment request defined in RFC 3921 which clients were required to perform at the beginning of a session. RFC 6121 dropped this entirely. This specification reinstates it as an optional no-op to aid backwards compability, matching commonly deployed workarounds.</t>
