      <t>This document proposes extensions to RSVP-TE for supporting multiple protection/restoration types (LSP Protection Types) in end-to-end protection/restoration. We propose the LSP Protection Type field to be defined in the Protection Object. Another aim of this document is prevention of an unintended connection for extra traffic when traffic from a failed working LSP is switched over to a backup LSP. We address this issue and propose a 3-way switchover signaling procedure.</t>
