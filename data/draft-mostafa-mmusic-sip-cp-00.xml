      <t>The NextGen video conferencing clients require multiple concurrent video streams to provide a User eXperience (UX) in which multiple participants can be viewed at the same time, this user experience is called Continuous Presence (CP) video. The multi-stream CP video provides more client control of the UX and less processing on the conference server since the video streams are relayed by the server rather than mixed to compose a CP video stream. The client CP layout, processing power and bandwidth limitations require a per stream bandwidth and resolution to be negtiated in the SIP Offer/ Answer with the conference server. Standard methods are used to achieve this negotiation in addition to a new SDP parameter. This document explains the methodology and solution to achieve this in SIP and SDP.</t>
