      <t>according to RFC 5654 MPLS-TP Requirement, there is a paragraph for recovery requirements just as section 2.5.6.1 in RFC5654 describles: within the context of recovery in MPLS-TP networks,the optimization criteria considered in ring topologies are as follows: 1 minimize the number of OAM entities that are needed to trigger the recovery operation; 2 Minimize the number of elements of recovery in the ring; 3 Minimize the number of labels required for the protection paths across the ring; 4 minimize the amount of control and management plane transactions during maintenance operation. this document will describle two types of ring protection solutions to implement these requirements.</t>
