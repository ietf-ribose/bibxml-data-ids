    <abstract>
      <t>Ad Hoc networks present an IPv6 addressing challenge due to the undetermined neighborhood properties of their interfaces. IPv6 nodes must assign locally-unique and topology-independent IPv6 addresses when topology-oriented IPv6 address delegation services are either absent or only intermittently available. This document introduces a new IPv6 address type (termed the "Multilink Local Address (MLA)") that nodes can autonomously assign to interfaces to support Ad Hoc network operations.</t>
