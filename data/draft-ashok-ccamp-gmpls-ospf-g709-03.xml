      <t>As OTN network capabilities continue to evolve, there is an increased need to support GMPLS control for the same. [RFC4328] introduced GMPLS signaling extensions for supporting the early version of G.709 [G.709-v1]. The basic routing considerations from signaling perspective is also specified in [RFC4328]. The recent revision of ITU-T Recommendation G.709 [G.709-v3] and [GSUP.43] have introduced new ODU containers (both fixed and flexible) and additional ODU multiplexing capabilities, enabling support for optimal service aggregation. This document describes OSPF protocol extensions to support Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) control for routing services over the standardized OTU/ODU containers in support of ODU based TDM switching. Routing support for Optical Channel Layer switching (Lambda switching) is not covered in this document.</t>
