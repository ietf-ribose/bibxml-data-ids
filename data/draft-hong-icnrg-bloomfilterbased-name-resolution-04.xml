      <t>In information-centric networking (ICN), uniquely identifiable and location independent names are assigned directly to the named data which raises scalability issues and they get even worse with flat names. Accordingly, name resolution system required for lookup-by- name routing in ICN has to be designed to scale, also considering mobility support. In this draft, a bloom filter-based flat name resolution system (B-NRS) is proposed where the bloom filter as an aggregated form of names and hierarchical structure of the B-NRS are exploited to address the scalability issues.</t>
