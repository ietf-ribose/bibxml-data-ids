      <t>This document specifies an extension to the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) which provides for inter-operation between existing implementations and those supporting the exchange of UTF-8 encoded pathnames, and clarifies certain issues involved with UTF-8 encoding. It introduces a new option, UTF-8, negotiated by use of the OPTS command. Through use of this option, the user informs the server of its willingness to accept UTF-8 encoded pathnames. The proposed extension requires that neither party transmit UTF-8 encoded pathnames without having first successfully negotiated this option.</t>
