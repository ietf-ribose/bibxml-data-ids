      <t>This document specifies an extension to the File Transfer Protocol(FTP) which provides for inter-operation between existingimplementations and those supporting the exchange of UTF-8 encodedpathnames, and clarifies certain issues involved with UTF-8 encoding.It introduces a new option, UTF-8, negotiated by use of the OPTScommand. Through use of this option, the user informs the server ofits willingness to accept UTF-8 encoded pathnames. The proposedextension requires that neither party transmit UTF-8 encodedpathnames without having first successfully negotiated this option.</t>
