      <t>Pre-Shared Key (PSK) based Key Exchange Mechanism is primarily used in constrained environments where resource intensive Asymmetric Cryptography cannot be used. In the Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, constrained devices are commonly used for collecting data via sensors for use in home automation, smart energy etc. In this context, DTLS is being considered as the primary protocol for communication security at the application layer and in some cases, it is also being considered for network access authentication. This document provides a specification for a new extension for Optimizing DTLS and TLS Handshake when the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) based Key Exchange is used. This extension is aimed at reducing the number of messages exchanged and the RTT of the TLS &amp; DTLS Handshakes.</t>
