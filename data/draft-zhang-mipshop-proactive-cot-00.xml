    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a practical scheme to run the care-of address test (part of the Return Routability test for Mobile IPv6 route optimization) in a proactive way in the context of the Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) protocol, so that the latency caused by the care-of address test after movements can be removed or reduced. Proactive care-of address test can make the Return Rroutability protocol more suitable for delay sensitive applications especially when it is applied in conjunction with other Return Routability optimization schemes.</t>
