    <abstract>
      <t>An encrypted DNS server is authenticated by a certificate signed by a Certificate Authority (CA). However, for typical encrypted DNS server deployments on Customer Premise Equipment (CPEs), the signature cannot be obtained or requires excessive interactions with a Certificate Authority. This document explores the use of TLS delegated credentials for a DNS server deployed on a CPE. This approach is meant to ease operating DNS forwarders in CPEs while allowing to make use of encrypted DNS capabilities.</t>
