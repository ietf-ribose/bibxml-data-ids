      <t>The ability of a multiple segment network to zero configure has advantages. This is especially the case when the network designer/builder has few IP networking skills, as can be expected in the home environment. This document describes a method for the zero- configuration of unique subnet prefixes in a network. The method proposed is based on the existence of the Unique Identifier Allocation Protocol (UIAP) but can be modified to use another protocol providing the same service.</t>
