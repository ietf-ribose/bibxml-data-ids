      <t>NAT-PT (RFC2766) is an address translation mechanism designed to facilitate communications between IPv6-only and IPv4-only nodes. This mechanism was designed to be used when tunneling transition mechanisms cannot be used. This document is intended to be a compilation of known security issues related to NAT-PT and includes a few new ones. These issues are discussed in some detail, and suggestions on how to deal with them are included in this document.</t>
