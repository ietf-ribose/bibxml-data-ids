      <t>HTTP is used increasingly in applications that need more facilities than the standard version of the protocol provides, ranging from distributed authoring, collaboration, and printing, to various remote procedure call mechanisms. This document proposes the use of a mandatory extension mechanism designed to address the tension between private agreement and public specification and to accommodate extension of applications such as HTTP clients, servers, and proxies. The proposal associates each extension with a URI[2], and use a few new RFC 822[1] style header fields to carry the extension identifier and related information between the parties involved in an extended transaction.</t>
