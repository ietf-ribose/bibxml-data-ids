      <t>The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT)stresses the global routing system in a number of ways. One of themost costly stresses is FIB size: ISPs often must upgrade routerhardware simply because the FIB has run out of space, and routervendors must design routers that have adequate FIB. FIB suppressionis an approach to relieving stress on the FIB by NOT loading selectedRIB entries into the FIB. Virtual Aggregation (VA) allows ISPs toshrink the FIBs of any and all routers, easily by an order ofmagnitude with negligible increase in path length and load. FIBsuppression deployed autonomously by an ISP (cooperation between ISPsis not required), and can co-exist with legacy routers in the ISP.</t>
