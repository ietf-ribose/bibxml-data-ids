      <t>This document describes SSTP, a protocol architecture that provides the support of SCCP and TCAP user applications over an IP network. The purpose of SSTP is to provide a standard tunneling protocol to convey SCCP messages over an IP based network. The core part of the SSTP architecture is the specification of the SSTP (Simple SCCP Tunneling Protocol) adaptation layer, that provides adaptation between the SCCP layer already defined in [3] and [4], and the IP family protocols IP, UDP, TCP and ICMP. TCP or UDP is used for SCCP class 0 messages. TCP is used for SCCP class 1, 2 or 3. SSTP provides similar primitives and parameters to SCCP than MTP, and provides seamless connection between nodes implementing SSTP and classical SS7 nodes by means of a SSTP gateway. The design of SSTP is oriented to fulfill the requirements of TCAP user applications running on a WAN.</t>
