      <t>This document describes SSTP, a protocol architecture that provides thesupport of SCCP and TCAP user applications over an IP network. Thepurpose of SSTP is to provide a standard tunneling protocol to conveySCCP messages over an IP based network. The core part of the SSTParchitecture is the specification of the SSTP (Simple SCCP TunnelingProtocol) adaptation layer, that provides adaptation between the SCCPlayer already defined in [3] and [4], and the IP family protocols IP,UDP, TCP and ICMP. TCP or UDP is used for SCCP class 0 messages. TCP isused for SCCP class 1, 2 or 3. SSTP provides similar primitives andparameters to SCCP than MTP, and provides seamless connection betweennodes implementing SSTP and classical SS7 nodes by means of a SSTPgateway. The design of SSTP is oriented to fulfill the requirements ofTCAP user applications running on a WAN.</t>
