      <t>This memorandum describes a proposed mechanism under which differing schemes for the naming, allocation and management of new international top-level domains may be tried without their interfering with each other. This memorandum discusses the trademrk issues underlying the current debate on International TLDs, and proposes non-interfering simultaneous experiments, following the proposals of [DENNINGER],[HIGGS],[MASEK] and [POSTEL]. This memo is being distributed to the Internet community in order to solicit their opinions of the proposals contained in it. In particular, The IETF, IANA, NEWDOM SHARED-TLD and related mailing lists are invited to read and comment on this material.</t>
