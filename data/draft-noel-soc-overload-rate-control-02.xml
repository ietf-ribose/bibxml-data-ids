      <t>The prevalent use of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC3261] in Next Generation Networks necessitates that SIP networks provide adequate control mechanisms to maintain transaction throughput by preventing congestion collapse during traffic overloads. Already [draft-ietf-soc-overload-control-05] proposes a loss-based solution to remedy known vulnerabilities of the [RFC3261] SIP 503 (service unavailable) overload control mechanism. This document proposes a rate-based control solution to complement the loss-based control defined in [draft-ietf-soc-overload-control-05].</t>
