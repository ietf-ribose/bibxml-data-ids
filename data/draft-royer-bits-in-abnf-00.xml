    <abstract>
      <t>This is an extension to the ABNF specification to allow for bits definitions to be defined. When interacting with hardware or bit oriented over the wire protocols ABNF is not currently the choice. This specification describes a method to add boolean and narrow bit values in order to fix that limitation. And this note while in in draft status: A new Open Source XDR [RFC4506] and ABNF generation tool is being developed [xdrgen] which generates code from ABNF and XDR. It can also generate ABNF from XDR. And it can generate XDR from ABNF. Both also can produce C++ source and header files.</t>
