      <t>This document suggests public policy questions that the IETF should consider and possibly address when developing new standards and protocols, and modifying or enhancing old standards and protocols. This document contains questions to be considered, as opposed to guidelines or rules that should in all cases be followed. This first draft provides a framework for identifying and discussing questions of public policy concern, and invites members of the IETF community to contribute to the questions and discussions raised here.</t>
