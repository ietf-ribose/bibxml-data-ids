    <abstract>
      <t>When Real-Time Multimedia over IP is applied to cellular systems, it is critical to minimize the overhead of the IP/UDP/RTP header, as spectral efficiency is a top requirement. Robustness to errors and error bursts is also a must. Existing IP/UDP/RTP header compression schemes such as that presented in IETF RFC 2508 [CRTP], do not provide sufficient performance in such environments. This report describes a new scheme (ACE, or Adaptive header ComprEssion), which like RFC 2508, is based on the idea that most of the time IP/UDP/RTP fields are either constant or can be extrapolated in a linear fashion. However, ACE incorporates several additional concepts which enable it to provide excellent compression efficiency (exceeds the performance of [CRTP]) along with a high degree of error-resiliency. Some of the concepts employed, such as Variable Length Encoding (VLE), enable ACE to adapt to changing behavior in the IP/UDP/RTP header fields, such that good efficiency and robustness characteristics are maintained over a wide range of operating conditions. ACE is a general framework that can be parameterized to account for the existence/non-existence and performance characteristics of the feedback channel. Thus, ACE is applicable over both bi-directional and unidirectional links. ACE is also able to perform a seamless handoff, i.e. the scheme can resume efficient compression operation immediately after handoff.</t>
