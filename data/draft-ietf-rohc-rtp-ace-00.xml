      <t>When Real-Time Multimedia over IP is applied to cellular systems, itis critical to minimize the overhead of the IP/UDP/RTP header, asspectral efficiency is a top requirement. Robustness to errors anderror bursts is also a must.Existing IP/UDP/RTP header compression schemes such as that presentedin IETF RFC 2508 [CRTP], do not provide sufficient performance insuch environments. This report describes a new scheme (ACE, orAdaptive header ComprEssion) , which like RFC 2508, is based on theidea that most of the time IP/UDP/RTP fields are either constant orcan be extrapolated in a linear fashion. However, ACE incorporatesseveral additional concepts which enable it to provide excellentcompression efficiency (exceeds the performance of [CRTP]) along witha high degree of error-resiliency. Some of the concepts employed,such as Variable Length Encoding (VLE), enable ACE to adapt tochanging behavior in the IP/UDP/RTP header fields, such that goodefficiency and robustness characteristics are maintained over a widerange of operating conditions.ACE is a general framework that can be parameterized to account forthe existence/non-existence and performance characteristics of thefeedback channel. Thus, ACE is applicable over both bi-directionaland unidirectional links.ACE is also able to perform a seamless handoff, i.e. the scheme canresume efficient compression operation immediately after handoff.</t>
