      <t>UDT does not have its specific security mechanism. It depends on the application to provide authentication and lower layer to provide security mechanisms[GG07]. However, UDT implementations should check each arrived packets are from the expected source, since UDP is connectionless. This document proposes evaluation of security requirements for UDT, or UDP based Data Transfer considered as an alternative data transfer protocol for the situation when TCP does not work well.The objective is to achieve a wide class of security methods used on existing mature protocols such as UDP and TCP.</t>
