      <t>RFC 5492 defines capabilities advertisement for the BGP peer. In addition, it is useful to be able to advertise BGP Next-Hop dependant capabilities, in particular for forwarding plane features. RFC 5492 is not applicable because the BGP peer may be different from the BGP Next-Hop, in particular when BGP Route Reflection is used. This document defines a mechanism to advertise such BGP Next Hop dependant Capabilities. This document defines a new BGP non-transitive attribute to carry Next-Hop Capabilities. This attribute is deleted or possibly modified when the BGP Next Hop is changed. This document also defines a Next-Hop capability to advertise the ability to handle the MPLS Entropy Label defined in RFC 6790. It updates RFC 6790 with regard to this BGP signaling.</t>
