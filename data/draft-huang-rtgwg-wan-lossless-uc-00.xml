    <abstract>
      <t>This document outlines the use cases and requirements for implementing lossless data transmission techniques in Wide Area Networks (WANs), motivated by the increasing demand for high- bandwidth and reliable data transport in applications such as high- performance computing (HPC), genetic sequencing, and audio/video production. The challenges associated with existing data transport protocols in WAN environments are discussed, along with the proposal of requirements for enhancing lossless transmission capabilities to support emerging data-intensive applications.</t>
