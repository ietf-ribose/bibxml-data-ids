      <t>This document defines a framework and the associated control plane requirements for the GMPLS based control of flexi-grid DWDM networks. To allow efficient allocation of optical spectral bandwidth for high bit-rate systems, the International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) has extended the recommendations [G.694.1] and [G.872] to include the concept of flexible grid. A new DWDM grid has been developed within the ITU-T Study Group 15 by defining a set of nominal central frequencies, channel spacings and the concept of "frequency slot". In such environment, a data plane connection is switched based on allocated, variable-sized frequency ranges within the optical spectrum.</t>
