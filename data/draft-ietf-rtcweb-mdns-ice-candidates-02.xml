    <abstract>
      <t>WebRTC applications collect ICE candidates as part of the process of creating peer-to-peer connections. To maximize the probability of a direct peer-to-peer connection, client private IP addresses are included in this candidate collection. However, disclosure of these addresses has privacy implications. This document describes a way to share local IP addresses with other clients while preserving client privacy. This is achieved by obfuscating IP addresses with dynamically generated Multicast DNS (mDNS) [RFC6762] names.</t>
