      <t>The General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol currently uses TCP or TLS over TCP for connection mode operation. This document describes the usage of GIST over the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). The use of SCTP can take the advantage of features provided by SCTP, namely streaming-based transport, support of multiple streams to avoid head of line blocking, and the support of multi-homing to provide network level fault tolerance. Additionally, the support for some extensions of SCTP is also discussed, namely its Partial Reliability Extension and the usage of TLS over SCTP.</t>
