      <t>The General Internet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol currentlyuses TCP or TLS over TCP for connection mode operation. Thisdocument describes the usage of GIST over the Stream ControlTransmission Protocol (SCTP). The use of SCTP can take the advantageof features provided by SCTP, namely streaming-based transport,support of multiple streams to avoid head of line blocking, and thesupport of multi-homing to provide network level fault tolerance.Additionally, the support for some extensions of SCTP is alsodiscussed, namely its Partial Reliability Extension and the usage ofTLS over SCTP.</t>
