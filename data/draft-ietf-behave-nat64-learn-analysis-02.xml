      <t>Hosts and applications may benefit from the knowledge if an IPv6 address is synthesized, which would mean a NAT64 is used to reach the IPv4 network or Internet. This document analyses a number of proposed solutions for communicating whether the synthesis is taking place, used address format, and the IPv6 prefix used by the NAT64 and DNS64. The solutions enable both NAT64 avoidance and intentional utilization by allowing local IPv6 address synthesis. The document concludes by recommending selection of heuristic discovery based solution.</t>
