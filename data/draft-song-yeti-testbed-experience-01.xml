      <t>This document reports and discusses issues in DNS root services, based on experiences from the experiments in the Yeti DNS project. These issues include IPv6-only operation, the root DNS server naming scheme, DNSSEC KSK rollover, root server renumbering, multiple root zone signer, and so on. This project was founded in May 2015 and has since built a live root DNS server system testbed with volunteer root server and resolver operations.</t>
