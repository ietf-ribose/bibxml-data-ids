      <t>Mobile IP[1] has emerged as a preferred solution for the macro mobility problem. In this draft, we discuss a possible extension to the existing Mobile IPv4 for multi-mode wireless terminals. This extension is based on [2] and has several advantages, including lesser packet delay, reduced traffic load on the home agent and lesser packet loss during handoff. In addition. This also allows the mobile node to take full advantage of Layer-2 specific features provided by the network. The proposal in this draft is in its initial stage and needs to be further studied.</t>
