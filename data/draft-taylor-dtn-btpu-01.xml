      <t>This document defines a protocol for the unidirectional transfer of large binary objects, typically Bundle Protocol version 7 bundles, between two nodes connected by a unidirectional, unreliable, frame- based link-layer protocol, without requiring IP services. The protocol does not require a return path for acknowledgements, but instead supports data repetition as a mechanism to protect against data loss. It fully supports the disaggregation of flows of bundles of different priority, preventing head-of-line blocking impacting performance. The binary wire format of the protocol is designed to enable performant implementation in hardware or software, with the aim of enabling protocol implementations to run at the line-rate of the underlying link-layer protocol.</t>
