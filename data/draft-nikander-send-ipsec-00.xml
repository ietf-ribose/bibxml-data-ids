      <t>The Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) Working Group has produced an Internet Draft that proposes to use an IPsec AH header that carries both a public key and a signature. However, based on the recent discussion at the mailing lists it seems that such a usage of AH is considered inappropriate at least by some members of the IPSEC WG. In this draft we introduce an alternative method, where a separate extension header is used to carry the public key, and the AH header only contains a signature.</t>
