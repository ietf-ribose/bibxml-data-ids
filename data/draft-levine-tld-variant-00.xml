      <t>IDNA [RFC5890] provides a method to map a subset of names written in Unicode into the DNS. Some languages allow a particular name to be written in multiple ways that are represented differently in IDNA, known as "variants". We survey the approaches that ICANN-managed top level domains have taken to the registration and provisioning of variant names.</t>
