      <t>This draft introduces filter rules as a means for a multi-homed node to perform per flow interface selection. Per flow interface selection is typically needed when there exist multiple network interfaces, each with different network characteristics, and an application has specific performance requirements for a data flow that makes one network interface more suitable than another. The use of OpenBSD Packet Filter (PF) syntax is proposed to describe the filter rules.</t>
