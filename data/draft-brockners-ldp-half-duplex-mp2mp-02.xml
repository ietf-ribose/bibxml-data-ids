      <t>This document describes a mechanism to construct Label Switched Paths (LSP) over MPLS using an extended version of the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) between a set of clients and servers. This communication mechanism has the capability that servers can communicate with other servers and clients, whereas clients can only communicate with servers but not with other clients. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119.</t>
