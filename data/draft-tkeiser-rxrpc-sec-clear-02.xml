      <t>RxRPC was originally designed as the remote procedure call layer for AFS-3. Today there are a number of anonymous RxRPC applications which require identity assertions in order to ensure that the desired peer receives and processes a procedure call. This memo defines a replacement for the rxnull security class which provides a means for mutually agreeing upon who is communicating, without incurring cryptographic overhead. It should be noted that, much like rxnull, this security object is not suitable for use in a distributed environment due to its inability to provide integrity protection.</t>
