      <t>RxRPC was originally designed as the remote procedure call layer forAFS-3. Today there are a number of anonymous RxRPC applicationswhich require identity assertions in order to ensure that the desiredpeer receives and processes a procedure call. This memo defines areplacement for the rxnull security class which provides a means formutually agreeing upon who is communicating, without incurringcryptographic overhead. It should be noted that, much like rxnull,this security object is not suitable for use in a distributedenvironment due to its inability to provide integrity protection.</t>
