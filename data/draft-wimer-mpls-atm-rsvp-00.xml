      <t>The MPLS Architecture [MPLS-ARCH] discusses a way in which ATMswitches may be used as Label Switching Routers. The ATM switchesrun network layer routing algorithms (such as OSPF, IS-IS, etc.), andtheir data forwarding is based on the results of these routingalgorithms. Additional ATM-specific routing and addressing isoptional but not required. ATM switches used in this way are knownas ATM-LSRs.</t>
