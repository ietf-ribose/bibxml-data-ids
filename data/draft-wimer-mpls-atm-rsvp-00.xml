      <t>The MPLS Architecture [MPLS-ARCH] discusses a way in which ATM switches may be used as Label Switching Routers. The ATM switches run network layer routing algorithms (such as OSPF, IS-IS, etc.), and their data forwarding is based on the results of these routing algorithms. Additional ATM-specific routing and addressing is optional but not required. ATM switches used in this way are known as ATM-LSRs.</t>
