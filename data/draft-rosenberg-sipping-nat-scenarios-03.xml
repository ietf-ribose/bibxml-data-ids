      <t>This document contains a set of examples about how to establishsessions through Network Address Translators (NATs) using the SessionInitiation Protocol (SIP). NAT traversal for SIP is accomplishedusing Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), which allows themedia streams to work, in addition to the SIP extension for symmetricresponse routing, which allows SIP itself to flow through NAT. Theexamples cover a range of network topologies and use cases. Thisvariability helps to demonstrate that the ICE methodology alwaysworks, and that a common client algorithm, independent of the networktopology and deployment configuration, results in the best connectivity.</t>
