    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an extension to BGP-4 which may be used by a BGP-4 speaker to solicit Virtual Private Network (VPN) reachability information from other IBGP speakers. The motivation of the proposed technique is to provide a means of reducing the memory requirements of routers which use BGP-4 to distribute VPN reachability information as described in [1] and [4]. The extension is backward compatible in that a router which supports the extension can interoperate with a router which doesn't.</t>
