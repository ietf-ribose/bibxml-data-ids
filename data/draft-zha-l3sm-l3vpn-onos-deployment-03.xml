      <t>This document defines a YANG model that is used to deliver layer 3 VPNservice in ONOS project which is on the controller level. L3SM is focused on the service model which is on the orchestration level to help interactionbetween customers and network operators and also can be input to automated controland configuration applications. ONOS runs as an open source project for fast deployment. Use L3VPN service model defined in L3SM and deploy L3VPN servicein ONOS project can be one step further. On the other hand, push real deployment in ONOS back to IETF is also beneficial.</t>
