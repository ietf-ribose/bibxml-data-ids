      <t>A traditional X.509 v3 certificate format contains only one public key. Nowadays, many Internet applications like SET, S/MIME and IPSEC etc. need more than one public key. This document describes a Multiple-Public-Key (MPK) certificate format to include multiple public keys in a digital certificate. The MPK certificate format is not only compatible with X.509 v3 certificate format; but also can reduce the length of multiple certificates and speed up the verification time needed for multiple public keys.</t>
