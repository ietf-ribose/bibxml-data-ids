      <t>This memo defines the Receiver Initiated Shortcut Path (RISP) protocol for NBMA networks. The protocol extends the NHRP message set by adding Callback Request and Reply messages to allow the destination host (or its corresponding egress router) to establish a shortcut path for a data flow, using the existing NBMA signaling protocols. Because of this receiver-initiated mechanism, a shortcut-capable network can use just the NBMA ARP servers, such as the ATMARP servers, instead of the more complex Next Hop Servers. This draft also describes how to extend NHRP with the new, receiver-initiated mechanism.</t>
