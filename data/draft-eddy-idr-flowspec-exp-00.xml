      <t>This document discusses new extensions beyond the existing BGP mechanisms that support mitigation of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The new extensions are focused on enabling an increase in collaborative inter-domain defenses involving multiple network providers, and enhancing the ability to describe desired filtering rules and actions. This document is primarily intended for discussion, and later on some ideas contained within it may be exported into other documents or specifications. In some cases, simple examples and proof-of-concept protocol mechanisms are described, but this document is not intended to become a standard or final protocol specification.</t>
