    <abstract>
      <t>This document discusses the use of the 3GGP Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) for authenticating and securing constrained devices. While GBA re-uses the 3GPP credentials, it does not require mobile network access, such as LTE, but requires only IP connectivity. Though building devices that employ GBA is obviously well known, this document specifically focuses on techniques necessary to minimize memory and energy consumption which is essential for constrained device networks.</t>
