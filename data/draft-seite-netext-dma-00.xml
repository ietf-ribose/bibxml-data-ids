      <t>Most existing IP mobility solutions are derived from Mobile IPprinciples where a given mobility anchor maintains Mobile Nodes (MNs)binding up-to-date. Data traffic is then encapsulated between themobility anchor and the MN or its Access Router. These approachesare usually implemented on a centralised architectures where both MNcontext and traffic encapsulation need to be processed at a centralnetwork entity, i.e. the mobility anchor. However, one of the trendin mobile network evolution is to "flatten" mobility architecture byconfining mobility support in the access network, e.g. at the accessrouters level, keeping the rest of the network unaware of themobility events and their support. This document discusses thedeployment of a Proxy Mobile IP approach in such a flat architecture.The solution allows to dynamically distribute mobility functionsamong access routers. The goal is also to dynamically adapt themobility support of the MN's needs by applying traffic redirectiononly to MNs' flows when an IP handover occurs.</t>
