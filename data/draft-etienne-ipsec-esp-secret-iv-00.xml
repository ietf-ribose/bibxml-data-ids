      <t>This memo presents a system of secret IV for ESP, based on theencryption of the sequence number. It doesn't add any space overheadin the packet and its generation can be parallelized and precomputed.Compared to the common explicit random IV (current MUST for ESPRFC2405.3 [5], or AES-CBC.3 [7]), it is more secure, saves bandwidth(e.g. 8 bytes with DES/3DES and 16 bytes with AES) but requiresslightly more computation.</t>
