      <t>This memo presents a system of secret IV for ESP, based on the encryption of the sequence number. It doesn't add any space overhead in the packet and its generation can be parallelized and precomputed. Compared to the common explicit random IV (current MUST for ESP RFC2405.3 [5], or AES-CBC.3 [7]), it is more secure, saves bandwidth (e.g. 8 bytes with DES/3DES and 16 bytes with AES) but requires slightly more computation.</t>
