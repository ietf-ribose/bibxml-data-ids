    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes some characteristics of communication between nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc wireless network. These are not requirements in the sense usually understood as applying to formulation of a requirements document. Nevertheless, protocol engineers and system analysts involved with designing solutions for ad hoc networks must maintain awareness of these characteristics.</t>
