      <t>The Initial Window (IW) provides the starting point for TCP's feedback-based congestion control algorithm. Its value has increased over time to increase performance and to reflect increased capability of Internet devices. This document describes a mechanism to adjust the IW over long timescales, to make future changes more safely deployed and to potentially avoid reexamination of this value in the future.</t>
