    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a base profile of TLS 1.3 for use with the US Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) 2.0 Suite, a cybersecurity advisory published by the United States Government which outlines quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithm policy for US national security applications. This profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of US National Security Systems that employ TLS 1.3. It is also appropriate for all other US Government systems that process high-value information. This memo is not an IETF standard, and has not been shown to have IETF community consensus. This profile is made publicly available for use by developers and operators of these and any other system deployments.</t>
