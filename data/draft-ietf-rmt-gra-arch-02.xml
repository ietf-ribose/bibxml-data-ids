      <t>Generic Router Assist (GRA) is a network-based service that enablesend-to-end multicast transport protocols to take advantage of infor-mation distributed across the network elements in a given multicastdistribution tree. The service consists of a canonical set of simplefunctions which network elements may apply to selected packets in thetransport session as they traverse the distribution tree. The choiceof function and the packet parameters to which it is applied can bedefined and customized for a given transport session in a highly con-trolled fashion that still permits enough flexibility for GRA to beused to address a wide range of multicast transport problems notamenable to end-to-end solution. This document provides the motiva-tion and an architecture for GRA.</t>
