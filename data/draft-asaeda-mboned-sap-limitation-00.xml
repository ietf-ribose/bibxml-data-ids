      <t>The Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) [2] has historically beenused to announce information for all available IP multicast sessionsto the prospective receivers in the experimental MBone. Eachreceiver can then discover which sessions are available and whichones he may want to join. Although SAP is easy to use, SAP is notscalable and controlling the SAP message transmission in a wide areanetwork is not easy. Therefore this document describes thelimitations of SAP when used in the global Internet. Furthermore,SAP has recently been used as a convenient method for conveyingconfiguration information to a set of receivers that are alreadyinterested by a multicast session (e.g., to carry FEC FrameworkConfiguration Information [7]). This documents describes thelimitations of SAP for this type of usage, since this latter israther different from its original goals.</t>
