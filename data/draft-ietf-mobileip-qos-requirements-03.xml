      <t>Mobile IP ensures correct routing of packets to mobile node as themobile node changes its point of attachment to the Internet.However, it is also required to provide proper QoS forwardingtreatment to mobile node's packet stream at the intermediate nodesin the network, so that QoS-sensitive IP services can be supportedover Mobile IP. This document describes requirements for an IP QoSmechanism for its satisfactory operation with Mobile IP.</t>
