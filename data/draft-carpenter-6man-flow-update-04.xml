    <abstract>
      <t>Various published proposals for use of the IPv6 flow label are incompatible with its existing specification in RFC 3697. Furthermore, very little practical use is made of the flow label, partly due to some uncertainties about the correct interpretation of the specification. This document proposes changes to the specification in order to clarify it, making it clear what types of usage are possible, and to introduce some additional flexibility.</t>
