      <t>Mtrace2 is a tool that can be used to discover the path a multicastpacket takes to reach one or more receivers. This document describesan enhancement to extend mtrace2 to be able to discover more than onepath for a single (S,G) or (*,G) entry and to trace more than one(S,G) or (*,G) entries simultaneously. Changes to the mtrace2protocol, and behaviors required by multicast routers to support thechanges, are specified in this document.</t>
