      <t>OSPF, an IGP widely deployed in IP networks today, requires each LSA to be refreshed by the originating router every 30 minutes. This method increases the protocol's robustness and solves potential problems that may be caused by software bugs, as well as some properties of the protocol itself. Though OSPF expects each LSA to be refreshed independently, ABRs and ASBRs tend to originate Type 3/4/5 LSAs within a short period of time, thus causing periodical network resource exhaustion by LSA refreshments. This document discusses the techniques that can be used to remedy this problem and provide smooth protocol operation. It must be noted that discussed methods can be applied to other link-state routing protocols, such as IS-IS.</t>
