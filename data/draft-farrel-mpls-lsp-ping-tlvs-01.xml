      <t>Techniques for detecting Multi-Protocol Label Switched (MPLS) dataplane failures are described in RFC 4379 and include the definitionof a control protocol for testing and verifying Label Switched Path(LSP) connectivity that is known as LSP Ping. The protocol consistsof a set of messages each of which contains data encoded as TLVs.The LSP Ping protocol is being extended for several related uses.Each extension gives rise to the definition of new TLVs to be carriedon the existing protocol messages.The LSP Ping specification makes it mandatory that all TLVs areunderstood by each participating Label Switching Router (LSR) thatreceives an LSP Ping message. This makes future extensibility hardwithout upgrading all LSRs in the network.This document defines ranges in the TLV codepoint space so that TLVsmay be associated with different processing rules within an LSR ifthe TLV is unknown. This will make extensibility more simple.</t>
