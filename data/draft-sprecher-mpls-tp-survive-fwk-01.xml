      <t>Network survivability is the network's ability to restore trafficfollowing failure or attack; it plays a critical factor in thedelivery of reliable services in transport networks. Guaranteedservices in the form of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) require aresilient network that detects facility or node failures veryrapidly, and immediately starts to restore network operations inaccordance with the terms of the SLA.The Transport Profile of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP) is apacket transport technology that combines the packet experience ofMPLS with the operational experience of transport networks likeSONET/SDH. It provides survivability mechanisms such as protectionand restoration, with similar function levels to those found inestablished transport networks such as in SONET/SDH networks. Some ofthe MPLS-TP survivability mechanisms are data plane-driven and arebased on MPLS-TP OAM fault management functions which are used totrigger protection switching in the absence of a control plane. Othersurvivability mechanisms utilize the MPLS-TP control plane.This document provides a framework for MPLS-TP survivability.</t>
