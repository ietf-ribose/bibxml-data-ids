      <t>This document describes a use case and a method for a DNS recursive resolver to use opportunistic encryption (that is, encryption with optional authentication) when communicating with authoritative servers. The motivating use case for this method is that more encryption on the Internet is better, and opportunistic encryption is better than no encryption at all. The method here is optional for both the recursive resolver and the authoritative server. Nothing in this method prevents use cases and methods that can use, or require, authenticated encryption.</t>
