      <t>This document presents a QoS architecture framework with preliminary protocol specifications for next generation wireless IP networks. The architecture is based on differentiated services in that traffic are aggregated and forwarded in backbone network based on per hop behaviors. In the proposed architecture, there is at least one global server and several local nodes in each administration domain. The server is referred to as the QoS Global Server (or QGS), and local nodes are referred to as QoS local nodes (or QLN). QLNs are ingress nodes of the DS (Differentiated Service) domain. They reside generally in the edge of wired backbone networks. The QGS retains the global information of the domain, and informs QLNs what to do when traffic comes in. The mobile station (MS) has the QoS signaling with QGS only. Once the QoS signaling is done, the QGS updates the QoS profile in each QLN. The MS is then free to move within the same domain without other QoS signaling. The actual traffic generated by MS goes through QLN only. The QGS is in control plane and QLNs are in transport plane. By retaining the global information in central server and separating control and transport, the architecture is flexible, easy to add new services, and more efficient for mobile environment.</t>
