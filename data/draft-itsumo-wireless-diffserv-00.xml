      <t>This document presents a QoS architecture framework withpreliminary protocol specifications for next generation wireless IPnetworks. The architecture is based on differentiated services inthat traffic are aggregated and forwarded in backbone network basedon per hop behaviors. In the proposed architecture, there is atleast one global server and several local nodes in eachadministration domain. The server is referred to as the QoS GlobalServer (or QGS), and local nodes are referred to as QoS local nodes(or QLN). QLNs are ingress nodes of the DS (DifferentiatedService) domain. They reside generally in the edge of wiredbackbone networks. The QGS retains the global information of thedomain, and informs QLNs what to do when traffic comes in. Themobile station (MS) has the QoS signaling with QGS only. Once theQoS signaling is done, the QGS updates the QoS profile in each QLN.The MS is then free to move within the same domain without otherQoS signaling. The actual traffic generated by MS goes through QLNonly. The QGS is in control plane and QLNs are in transport plane.By retaining the global information in central server andseparating control and transport, the architecture is flexible,easy to add new services, and more efficient for mobileenvironment.</t>
