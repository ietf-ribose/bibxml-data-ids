      <t>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new architecture that provides optimal multicast forwarding without requiring intermediate routers to maintain any per-flow state by using a multicast-specific BIER header. An extension to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) defined in [RFC5036] for the setup of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) is described in [RFC6388] is called mLDP, and is used for multicast- specific tree building. This document describes mLDP extensions to setup a P2MP with BIER information, which is called P2MP based BIER in [I-D.xie-bier-mvpn-mpls-p2mp].</t>
