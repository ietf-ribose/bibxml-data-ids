      <t>IP mobility protocols have traditionally been designed to beindependent of any L2 considerations. A critical factor in achievinggood performance for IP mobility protocols is its closeness to an L2handover. Handover occurs when a Mobile Node moves from one radioaccess Point to another. If the new radio access point is associatedwith a new subnet, the routing reachability change will have to reflectat the access routers. Better synchronization between L2 handover andL3 handover are still more important when supporting fast handoffbetween two wireless domains. This draft discusses the L2 handoversteps and the possible coupling of L2 and L3 layers to support optimizelayer 3 handover. This draft also explores the location information asa possible L2 trigger to support optimized L3 handover. Also an L2trigger message format is defined which can be handled at L3independent of other protocol considerations.</t>
