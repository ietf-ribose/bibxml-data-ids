      <t>This document describes the DIAMETER Dial-up User Authentication Extension that is used for ROAMOPS [4] purposes. This specification was carefully designed to ease the burden of servers that must act as RADIUS/DIAMETER gateways, by re-using the same address space that RADIUS has defined [1]. Further, by re-using the same address space, it allows a single server to read the same dictiionary for both DIAMETER and RADIUS. This backward compatibility will hopefully facilitate deployment of DIAMETER.</t>
