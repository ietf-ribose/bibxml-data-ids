      <t>For some time now several equipment manufactures have been implementing what is called L2TP tunnel switching or L2TP multihop. Although this technology has several applications and is quite widespread, there has been no effort to standardize the nomenclature and methods associated with it. The goal of this document is to achieve a common denominator in what is tunnel switching, its advantages and nomenclature associated with it .</t>
