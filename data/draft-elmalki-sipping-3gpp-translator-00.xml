      <t>There have been discussions on the v6ops mailing list and at IETF meetings regarding the suitability of translators (i.e. NAT-PT) as mechanisms for IPv4 to IPv6 transition. It has often been stated that NAT-PT is not a mechanism to be recommended in general to solve the IPv6-IPv4 transition problem. There have also been discussions regarding special scenarios where some form of translators could be deployed if their use is documented appropriately. The aim of this draft is to document the rationale for using translators in 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) networks for IPv6-only SIP- based IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) services and to describe a solution to the problem.</t>
