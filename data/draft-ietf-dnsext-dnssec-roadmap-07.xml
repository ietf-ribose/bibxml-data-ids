      <t>DNS Security (DNSSEC)technology is composed of extensions to the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol that provide data integrity and authentication to security aware resolvers and applications through the use of cryptographic digital signatures. Several documents exist to describe these extensions and the implementation-specific details regarding specific digital signing schemes. The interrelationship between these different documents is discussed here. A brief overview of what to find in which document and author guidelines for what to include in new DNS Security documents, or revisions to existing documents, is described.</t>
