      <t>DNS Security (DNSSEC)technology is composed of extensions to theDomain Name System (DNS) protocol that provide data integrity andauthentication to security aware resolvers and applications throughthe use of cryptographic digital signatures. Several documents existto describe these extensions and the implementation-specific detailsregarding specific digital signing schemes. The interrelationshipbetween these different documents is discussed here. A briefoverview of what to find in which document and author guidelines forwhat to include in new DNS Security documents, or revisions toexisting documents, is described.</t>
