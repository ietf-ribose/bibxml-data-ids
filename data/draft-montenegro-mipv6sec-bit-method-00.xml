      <t>Mobile IPv6 uses 'return routability' to secure route optimization. Even after using this procedure, there are residual threats for which other stronger methods provide protection. Since these are optional, and return routability is the default, an attacker may engage in 'bidding down' attacks. These attacks aim at coercing participants in Mobile IPv6 route optimization to forgo the stronger methods for the default return routability. This document discusses what the participants in route optimization can do to deter or alleviate bidding down attacks: the 'step down' procedure for the mobile node and the 'bit method' at the correspondent node.</t>
