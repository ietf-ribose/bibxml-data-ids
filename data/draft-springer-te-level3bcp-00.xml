      <t>This paper discusses Traffic Engineering with Multi-Protocol Label Switching in the Level3 network. A brief overview of traffic engineering is given followed by constraints affecting Level3's design. The approach Level3 will use, which is LDP edge and an RSVP-TE core, is presented. Several architectures were considered when deciding upon a design. These methods are discussed as well as the reasons they were ultimately refuted.</t>
