      <t>This paper discusses Traffic Engineering with Multi-ProtocolLabel Switching in the Level3 network. A brief overview of trafficengineering is given followed by constraints affecting Level3'sdesign. The approach Level3 will use, which is LDP edge and an RSVP-TEcore, is presented. Several architectures were considered whendeciding upon a design. These methods are discussed as well as thereasons they were ultimately refuted.</t>
