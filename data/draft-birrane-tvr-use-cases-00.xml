      <t>Time-Variant Routing (TVR) refers to the calculation of a path or subpath through a network where the time of message transmission (or receipt) is part of the overall route computation. This means that, all things being equal, a TVR computation might produce different results depending on the time that the computation is performed without other detectable changes to the network topology or other cost functions associated with the route. This document introduces use cases where TVR computations could improve message exchange in a network.</t>
