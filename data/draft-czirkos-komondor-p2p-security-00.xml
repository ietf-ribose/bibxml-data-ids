      <t>This memo presents Komondor, an experimental peer-to-peer security system. Komondor is a network intrusion detection system. Hosts running this software organize themselves automatically in an overlay network, where they share information about intrusion attempts they detect. This way the security of all participants is increased, as they are able to prepare for some of the attacks in advance. The overlay created is a peer-to-peer network, which is completely decentralized. This communication model ensures stability, and by using this the system remains operational over an unstable network.</t>
