    <abstract>
      <t>White space allocation and reutilization has attracted increasing attention since they allow a more efficient way to gather spectrum usage information and keep assigning a proper spectrum to a secondary user. This document provides an extended protocol to construct a specific white space usage map with better interaction between devices and spectrum database. By this mechanism, the Master device or Slave Device sends the environmental spectrum to the Database and obtains more frequency points to select the most appropriate white space spectrum it could use in the local regulatory domain. With regard to White Space Database, more white space information can be recorded for devices to choose. The mechanism is an extension of protocol to access spectrum database. We develop extended protocol data models under different scenarios to enhance interaction of these networks.</t>
