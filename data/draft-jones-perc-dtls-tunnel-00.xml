      <t>This document defines a DTLS tunneling protocol for use in multimedia conferences that enables a Media Distribution Device (MDD) to facilitate key exchange between an endpoint in a conference and the Key Management Function (KMF) responsible for key distribution. The protocol is designed to ensure that key material used for end-to-end encryption and authentication is inaccessible to the MDD, while key material used for hop-by-hop encryption and authentication is accessible to the MDD.</t>
