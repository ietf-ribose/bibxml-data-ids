      <t>This memorandum discusses the requirements for telephonysignaling and device control over the Internet from theperspective of meeting the needs of Internet service providers(ISPs) and telecom carriers wishing to provide Internet servicesthat include telephony. The requirements apply equally to variousInternet telephony and non-Internet telephony devices. For thepurpose of this Internet draft, the notion of telephony isbroadened to include control of other types of streaming mediasessions, such as RTSP based media server device control. Ratherthan severely restricting the device control framework to aparticular set of devices, such as IP telephony gateways andtelephony network access servers, this Internet draft presentsrequirements that are broad enough to satisfy the needs of anydevice that is expected to provide telephony and relatedservices on the Internet.</t>
