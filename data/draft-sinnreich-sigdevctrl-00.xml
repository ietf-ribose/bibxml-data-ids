      <t>This memorandum discusses the requirements for telephony signaling and device control over the Internet from the perspective of meeting the needs of Internet service providers (ISPs) and telecom carriers wishing to provide Internet services that include telephony. The requirements apply equally to various Internet telephony and non-Internet telephony devices. For the purpose of this Internet draft, the notion of telephony is broadened to include control of other types of streaming media sessions, such as RTSP based media server device control. Rather than severely restricting the device control framework to a particular set of devices, such as IP telephony gateways and telephony network access servers, this Internet draft presents requirements that are broad enough to satisfy the needs of any device that is expected to provide telephony and related services on the Internet.</t>
