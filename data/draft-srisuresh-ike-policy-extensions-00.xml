      <t>As IPsec is widely deployed, there is increasing need to negotiatesecurity keys using IKE at application level granularity. IKE, as currently proposed, has restrictions in negotiating keysfor applications with bundled sessions and complex policies. The draft identifies the problem with IKE and suggests extensions to make IKE application and policy friendly. The proposed solutionsuggests extensions to the conceptual operation of IPsec as well asIKE, but does not require changes to existing IKE payloads. The document introduces a new policy payload that complements existingIKE payloads and suggests replacing ID payload with the Policypayload, in Quick mode.</t>
