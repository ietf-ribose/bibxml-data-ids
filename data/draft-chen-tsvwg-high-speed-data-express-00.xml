    <abstract>
      <t>With the rapid development of AI technology, intelligent computing and super-computing services, the demand for wide-area transmission of massive data is increasing. This paper makes full use of the advantages of IP network, such as statistical reuse and elastic supply, and proposes a reference architecture of high elasticity and high throughput data express based on IP network. In order to support differentiated data express services and create task-type data express services, the "one low and three high" technical system is proposed.</t>
