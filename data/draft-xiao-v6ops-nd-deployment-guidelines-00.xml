    <abstract>
      <t>Neighbor Discovery (ND) is an integral part of IPv6 first-hop. Due to limitation of certain L2 media's support to ND, a number of issues can happen in certain scenarios. The corresponding solutions for these issues have also been designed. These issues and solutions are summarized in RFC3756, RFC6583, OPSECv27. However, there is no guideline on how to avoid the issues or how to select the proper solutions. This document analyzes existing solutions and summarizes the wisdoms embedded in these solutions into an insight: isolating hosts in L2 and L3 can be effective in preventing ND issues. In deployment scenarios where the ND issues can occur, this prevention approach can be more effective than deploying various solutions to solve the issues. Based on this insight, a set of guidelines is proposed for future ND deployments. These guidelines describe where and when to isolate hosts in L2 and L3 to prevent ND issues, and how to select suitable solutions for the remaining issues. This will likely simplify ND deployments. The impact of the guidelines to other components of IPv6 first-hop is also analyzed and appears small. Therefore, the guidelines will likely simplify the overall IPv6 first-hop deployments.</t>
