      <t>This document proposes a solution for the discovery problem in MIMI (More Instant Messaging Interoperability). The discovery problem is the technique by which a user in one messaging provider can determine the preferred messaging provider for a target user identified by an email address or phone number. The discovery problem has been the subject of numerous - largely failed - standardization attempts at the IETF. This document outlines these attempts and hypothesizes the reasons for their failure, using that to define a set of requirements to avoid these failures in a next attempt. The new proposed solution, called Global Lookup and Discovery of Services (GLADOS), is a distributed service wherein the data is stored and managed by local providers that exchange routing information to facilitate a global lookup capability over a flat namespace.</t>
