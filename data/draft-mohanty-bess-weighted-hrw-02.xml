    <abstract>
      <t>Rendezvous Hashing also known as Highest Random Weight (HRW) has been used in many load balancing applications where the central problem is how to map an object to as server such that the mapping is uniform and also minimally affected by the change in the server set. Recently, it has found use in DF election algorithms in the EVPN context and load balancing using DMZ. This draft deals with the problem of achieving load balancing with minimal disruption when the servers have different weights. It provides an algorithm to do so and also describes a few use-case scenarios where this algorithmic technique can apply.</t>
