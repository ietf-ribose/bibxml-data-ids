    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes various use cases for a Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD), and provides requirements such that protocol mechanisms allow for a simplified detection of forwarding failures. These use cases support S-BFD, as a simplified mechanism to use Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) with large portions of negotiation aspects eliminated, accelerating the establishment of a BFD session. S-BFD benefits include quick provisioning as well as improved control and flexibility to network nodes initiating the path monitoring.</t>
