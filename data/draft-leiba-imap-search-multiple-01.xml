      <t>The IMAP4 specification allows the searching only of the selectedmailbox. A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and aclient that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT andSEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete before moving on to thenext. This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxeswith one command, limiting the round-trips and waiting for varioussearches to complete. This also introduces named searches, allowinga client to pipeline the searches if it chooses.</t>
