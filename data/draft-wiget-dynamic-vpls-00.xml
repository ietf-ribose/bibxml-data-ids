    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an experimental serverless solution to build Virtual Private LAN Segments (VPLS) for TCP/IP over a multicast enabled IP backbone. IP traffic is encapsulated in IPsec [RFC2401] tunnel mode. IP broadcast and multicast traffic is sent, after encapsulation in IPSec tunnel mode, to the VPN assigned IP multicast address. IP unicast traffic, after encapsulation, is sent directly to the dynamically learned IP tunnel endpoint address. Multicast Enabled ARP (ME-ARP) as defined in this document is used to dynamically build the mapping between IP addresses and remote tunnel endpoints. The tunnel endpoint information is hidden in the hardware address given to IP devices in the ARP reply. Therefore IP devices participating in a VPLS keep track of the remote locations of other VPLS members through their own ARP table without 'knowledge'.</t>
