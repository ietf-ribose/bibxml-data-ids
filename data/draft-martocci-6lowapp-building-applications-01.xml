      <t>Building management systems have evolved toward IP communication at the enterprise level during the past decade. IP implementation at the real-time control and sensor layers would provide a single pervasive protocol usable across the entire system increasing flexibility and code reuse. This document will describe the topology of these building networks, the application protocols widely used in their deployment and the application use cases.</t>
