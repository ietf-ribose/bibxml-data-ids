      <t>The decision to develop a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) in cooperation between the IETF and the ITU-T is document in RFC 5317 as the decision of the Joint Working Team on MPLS-TP. This document provides additional detail of the processes for the development of IETF RFCs on MPLS-TP. It provides an adaptation of the IETF working group process; identifies the expected participation in the process by the ITU-T; and clarifies the rules and conventions regarding MPLS-TP documents. This document does not specify any ITU-T process; ITU-T activities will be done according to ITU-T process/rules. This document does not specify or modify the normal IETF working group process. It is limited to the specific adaptations of that process to facilitate the cooperation agreement between the IETF and the ITU-T on MPLS-TP, and to ensure a good and consistent document review across the two organizations. This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.</t>
