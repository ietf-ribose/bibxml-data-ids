      <t>Mobile nodes enhance their connections across wireless media byestablishing specific parameters at the FA/AR/AP in order tofacilitate optimal usage of the resources as well as enhance the QoSas seen by a MN. During handover from one access router to another, abandwidth-constrained mobile node MAY need to have state informationpassed from the previous router to the new one. This documentproposes a context transfer framework that makes use of existing fasthandoff signaling for context transfer as well as provide a mechanismfor QoS negotiation and renegotiations. We also cover CT under CARdiscovery. The suggested mechanism provides for context transfer sothat the applications running on the mobile node could operate withminimal disruption.</t>
