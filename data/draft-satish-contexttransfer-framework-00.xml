      <t>Mobile nodes enhance their connections across wireless media by establishing specific parameters at the FA/AR/AP in order to facilitate optimal usage of the resources as well as enhance the QoS as seen by a MN. During handover from one access router to another, a bandwidth-constrained mobile node MAY need to have state information passed from the previous router to the new one. This document proposes a context transfer framework that makes use of existing fast handoff signaling for context transfer as well as provide a mechanism for QoS negotiation and renegotiations. We also cover CT under CAR discovery. The suggested mechanism provides for context transfer so that the applications running on the mobile node could operate with minimal disruption.</t>
