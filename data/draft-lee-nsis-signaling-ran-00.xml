      <t>The IETF NSIS WG is standardizing IP signaling protocols with QoSsignaling as the first use case. It is desirable to consider QoSsignaling procedures for resource reservations in an IP-based RANwhere mobide nodes undergo frequent handoffs. In this draft, wedescribe general QoS signaling procedures for an IP-based RAN, whichare based on the analysis of the existing QoS signaling solutions inmobile wireless networks. We also present a specific QoS signalingscheme based on the proposed general signaling procedures.</t>
