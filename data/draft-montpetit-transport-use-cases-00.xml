      <t>This document describes some of the use cases that will allow choosing different transport services. It also presents their derived requirements and conditions of utilization, when available, to an application attached to an Internet subnetwork. The use cases assume that a transport "choice" is based on the requirements of the application. The fallback is considered to be TCP/UDP.</t>
