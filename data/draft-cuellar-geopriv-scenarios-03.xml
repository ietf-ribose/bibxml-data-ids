      <t>This document describes location-based service scenarios for Geopriv. It complements the Geopriv Requirements document by providing a set of examples in which the Geopriv Location Object (LO) may be used. Thus this documents serves as a basis to discuss and analyze the security (authentication, authorization, integrity and confidentiality) and privacy issues and requirements associated with location-based services. To be useful, these scenarios include details of location computation, which helps to identify the entities involved on an abstract level and where privacy issues like control, consent, access, and security arise.</t>
