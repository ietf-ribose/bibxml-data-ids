      <t>This document contains the profile for Congestion Control Identifier 4, the Small-Packet variant of TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC), in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP). CCID 4 is for experimental use, and uses TFRC-SP [TFRC-SP], a Small-Packet (SP) variant of TFRC designed for applications that send small packets. The goal for TFRC-SP is to achieve roughly the same bandwidth in bits per second (bps) as a TCP flow using packets of up to 1500 bytes but experiencing the same level of congestion. CCID 4 is for experimental use for senders that send small packets and would like a TCP-friendly sending rate, possibly with Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), while minimizing abrupt rate changes.</t>
