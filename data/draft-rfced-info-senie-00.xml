      <t>Attacks on public servers by deliberate overloading with TCP sessions is emerging as a significant problem on the Internet. This form of attack is similar to that used against 800 numbers of some organizations by those opposed to their views. Proposed here is a technique that can be implemented in most routers at or near the periphery of the network, which would reduce the efficacy of such attacks and provide network administrators with indication when users of their networks attempt such an attack. The purpose of this memo is to propose a solution to this problem, and hopefully result in a discussion of the issue.</t>
