      <t>Given a gateway and a (possibly empty) list of gateway attributes, the 'gateway location problem' is to find a gateway serving the given phone number that satisfies the attribute set. This problem has also been referred to as the 'call routing problem' as the answer returned may not be an IP-PSTN gateway but an intermediate signaling server. Part of the solution to this problem is the maintenance and distribution of the call routing tables. This document describes a protocol for maintaining a distributed call routing database across multiple administrative domains. The protocol uses the Server Cache Synchronization Protocol (SCSP) to maintain the distributed database. This document describes the problem of gateway location and a potential solution that uses SCSP as the foundation for distributing the call routing tables.</t>
