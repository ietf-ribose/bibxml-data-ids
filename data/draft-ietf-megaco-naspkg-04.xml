      <t>This document is intended to satisfy the requirements in section 11.2.5 of the Megaco/H.248 requirements document. It defines five packages: - the base NAS package contains properties and events supported by all NAS terminations; - the NAS Incoming package contains properties and events supported by NAS terminations involved in calls initiated by the circuit network; - the NAS Outgoing package contains properties supported by NAS terminations involved in calls outgoing to the circuit network; - the NAS Control package contains an event supported by a NAS Control termination, which allows the MG to indicate a request to initiate a data connection to a terminal served by the switched circuit network; - the NAS ROOT package contains properties supported by an MG which is also capable of supporting at least the NAS and NAS Incoming packages.</t>
