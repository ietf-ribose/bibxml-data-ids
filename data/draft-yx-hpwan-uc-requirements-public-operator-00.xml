      <t>Bulk data transfer is a long-lived service over the past twenty years. High Performance Wide Area Networks (HP-WANs) are the backbone of global network infrastructure, enabling the seamless transfer of vast amounts of data and supporting advanced scientific collaborations worldwide. Many of the state-of-the-art dedicated networks have been mentioned in [I-D.kcrh-hpwan-state-of-art]. For non-dedicated networks like public operator's network, the case is different in terms of QoS policies, security policies, etc. This document presents use cases and requirements of HPWAN from public operator's view.</t>
