      <t>This memo defines Web link types that invalidate HTTP caches, along with an HTTP cache-control extension that allows caches that understand those link types to use responses containing them. Together, these mechanisms offer a way to avoid use of a response that has become stale due to another request that changes server-side state. Collectively, this is referred to as Linked Cache Invalidation (LCI).</t>
