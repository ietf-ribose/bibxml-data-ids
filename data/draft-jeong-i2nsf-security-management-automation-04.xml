      <t>This document describes Security Management Automation (SMA) of cloud-based security services in the framework of Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF). The security management automation in this document deals with closed-loop security control, security policy translation, and security audit. To support these three features in SMA, this document specifies an augmented architecture of the I2NSF framework with new system components and new interfaces.</t>
