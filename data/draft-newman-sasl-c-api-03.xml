      <t>Almost every protocol needs authentication. However, there does notexist an authentication mechanism suitable for all organizations, noris it likely that a small fixed set of authentication mechanisms willremain suitable. SASL [SASL] provides the on-the-wire framework forauthentication (and a security layer) which separates the design ofauthentication mechanisms from the protocols in which they're used.The SASL protocol model suggests a software architecture whereapplication protocols call a generic API to authenticate which inturn calls a generic plug-in interface for extensible authenticationmodules. This memo documents the API used in one implementation ofthis architecture in the hope that it will be useful to others. Anassociated memo documenting the plug-in interface is forthcoming.</t>
