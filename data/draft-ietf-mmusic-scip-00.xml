      <t>The conference invitation protocol (SCIP) is an application-level protocol for inviting users to multimedia conferences. Network users are identified by their universal communication identifier, usually their electronic mail address. SCIP offers personal mobility by supporting forwarding and redirection. It can reuse the general email infrastructure, including DNS MX records, mailing lists and aliases. The protocol combines aspects of HTTP and SMTP and can re-use their security mechanism. The protocol is extensible in methods and parameters and is designed to allow interoperation with ITU-T T.124 (Generic Conference Control). Extension to VCR-control are possible as well. The protocol supports both loose and tight conference styles.</t>
