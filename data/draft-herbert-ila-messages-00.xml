      <t>This specification defines control messages for Identifier Locator Addressing. These control messages are sent between ILA hosts or from ILA routers to ILA hosts to notify a sending host to change its entry for an identifier in its ILA mapping table. Messages indicate that no mapping was found for a destination identifier or indicate a redirect to use a different locator for an identifier.</t>
