      <t>Many organizations have web forms that provoke an e-mail confirmation to the e-mail address provided in the form. Malicious entities do bulk form submissions with forged addresses, resulting in mail floods to the holders of those addresses. This document defines a message header to identify mail sent in response to web forms, so that recipient mail systems can better recognize and mitigate the mail floods.</t>
