      <t>This document defines enhancements to the bootstrapping a remote secure key infrastructure (BRSKI, [RFC8995] ) to facilitate bootstrapping in domains featuring no or only timely limited connectivity between a pledge and the domain registrar. This specifically targets situations, in which the interaction model changes from a pledge-initiator-mode as in BRSKI to a pledge- responder-mode as desribed here. To support this functionality BRSKI-PRM introduces a new registrar-agent component, which facilitates the communication between pledge and registrar during the bootstrapping phase. To support the establishment of a trust relation between a pledge and the domain registrar, BRSKI-PRM relies on the exchange of authenticated self-contained objects (signature- wrapped objects). The defined approach is agnostic regarding the utilized enrollment protocol, deployed by the registrar to communicate with the Domain CA.</t>
