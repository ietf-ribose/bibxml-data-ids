    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a mechanism to extend the record header in TLS and DTLS. To that aim, the (D)TLS header is modified as follows: the length field is trimmed to 15 bits, and the length's top bit is given the "record header extension indicator" semantics, allowing a sender to signal that one or more record header extensions have been added to this record. We define the generic format of a record header extension and the general rules associated with its handling. Any details regarding syntax, semantics and negotiation of a specific record header extension, are left to future documents.</t>
