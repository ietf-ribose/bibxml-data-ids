    <abstract>
      <t>This document extends PASSporT, which is a token object that conveys cryptographically-signed information about the participants involved in communications, to include information defined as part of the SHAKEN specification from ATIS (Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions) and the SIP Forum IP-NNI Joint Task Force. These extensions provide a level of confidence in the correctness of the originating identity for a telephone network that has communications coming from both STIR participating originating communications as well as communications that does not include STIR information.</t>
