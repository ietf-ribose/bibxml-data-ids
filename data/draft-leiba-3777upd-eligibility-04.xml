      <t>RFC 3777 specifies that "sitting members" of the IAB and IESG "may not volunteer to serve on the nominating commitee". Since that document was written the IAOC was formed, and that body is not covered by RFC 3777. There is also uncertainty about whether ex- officio members and liaisons are included as "sitting members". This document updates RFC 3777 and clarifies those situations.</t>
