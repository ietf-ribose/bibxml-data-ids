    <abstract>
      <t>Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN, RFC7432) is becoming prevalent in Data Centers, Data Center Interconnect (DCI) and Service Provider VPN applications. When multi-homing from a CE to multiple PEs, including links in an EVPN instance on a given Ethernet Segment, in an all-active redundancy mode, [RFC7432] describes a basic mechanism to elect a Designated Forwarder (DF), and [RFC8584] improves basic DF election by a HRW algorithm. [I- D.ietf-bess-evpn-per-mcast-flow-df-election] enhances the HRW algorithm for the multicast flows to perform DF election at the granularity of (ESI, VLAN, Mcast flow). This document specifies a new algorithm, based on multicast bandwidth utilization and multicast state quantity, in order for the multicast flows to elect a DF.</t>
