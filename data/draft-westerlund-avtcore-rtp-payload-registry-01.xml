      <t>It has been observed that specifications of new RTP payload formats often forget to register themselves in the IANA registry "RTP Payload Formats Media Types". In practice this has no real impact. One reason is that the Media Types registry is the crucial registry to register any Media Type to establish the media type used to identified the format in various signaling usage. To resolve this situation this document performs the following. First it updates the registry to include known RTP payload formats at the time of writing. Then it closes the IANA Registry for RTP Payload formats Media Types for future registration. Beyond instructing IANA to close this registry the instructions to authors in RFC 8088 are updated that registration is no longer required in the closed registry.</t>
