      <t>This document details the possible architectural and design choices in order to determine i) the spatial location of the so-called "IRS interface" and the functional entities it directly and/or indirectly involves, ii) the number of levels of redirection between routing modules and application (and associated identifier space), and iii) the various constraints that can be anticipated when dealing with the coupling of functional planes including the prevention of oscillations between two or more routing system states, coupling effects (leading to amplification chains) and, concurrency (leading to antagonistic action-reaction).</t>
