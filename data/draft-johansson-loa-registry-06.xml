      <t>This document establishes an IANA registry for Level of Assurance (LoA) Profiles. The registry is intended to be used as an aid to discovering such LoA definitions in protocols that use an LoA concept, including Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 and OpenID Connect. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>
