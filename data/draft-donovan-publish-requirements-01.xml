      <t>This document defines the requirements for a proposed extension to the Session Initiation Protocol [1]. This extension would provide a general-purpose mechanism for uploading service related data. For instance, there is currently the need to upload or publish CPL to SIP Proxies and presence documents to SIP Presence Servers. This document does NOT outline an extension to SIP to handle these requirements. The author is attempting to follow the guidelines that requirements should be defined and agreed to before work on the an extension begins.</t>
