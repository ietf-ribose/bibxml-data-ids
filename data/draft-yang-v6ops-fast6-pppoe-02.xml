      <t>Although there have already been some transition solutions and technologies, it is still lack of a complete solution for large scale broadband ISPs based on the network architecture considering service providers' requirements and constraints in the real world. This document proposes an IPv6 transitioning architecture, the FAST6, which is based on the common broadband network architecture and providing IPv6 transition solutions going through the whole transition period.</t>
