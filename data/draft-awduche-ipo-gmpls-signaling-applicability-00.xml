      <t>This memo describes the applicability of GMPLS signaling to IP over Optical (IPO) networks. The underlying premise behind GMPLS signaling for IPO networks is discussed and pertinent limitations are highlighted. Throughout this discussion, GMPLS-RSVP (RSVP-TE with GMPLS extensions) will be used to exemplify the class of protocols under consideration. This memo also describes the subsets of GMPLS signaling message exchanges that are needed to support connection management between optical switches, and between IP/MPLS routers and optical switches in IP over Optical networks.</t>
