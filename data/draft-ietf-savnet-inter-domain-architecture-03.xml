    <abstract>
      <t>This document introduces an inter-domain SAVNET architecture for performing AS-level SAV and provides a comprehensive framework for guiding the design of inter-domain SAV mechanisms. The proposed architecture empowers ASes to generate SAV rules by sharing SAV- specific information between themselves, which can be used to generate more accurate and trustworthy SAV rules in a timely manner compared to the general information. During the incremental or partial deployment of SAV-specific information, it can utilize general information to generate SAV rules, if an AS's SAV-specific information is unavailable. Rather than delving into protocol extensions or implementations, this document primarily concentrates on proposing SAV-specific and general information and guiding how to utilize them to generate SAV rules. To this end, it also defines some architectural components and their relations.</t>
