      <t>This memo discusses strategies for supporting 'DNS searching' --finding of names in the DNS, or references that will ultimately pointto DNS names, by a mechanism layered above the DNS itself thatpermits fuzzy matching, selection that uses attributes or facets, anduse of descriptive terms. Demand for these facilities appear to beincreasing with growth in the Internet (and especially the web) andwith requirements to move beyond the restricted subset of ASCII namesthat have been the traditional contents of DNS 'Class=IN'. Thisdocument proposes a three-level system for access to DNS names inwhich the upper two levels involve search, rather than lookup(exactly known target), functions. It also discusses some of theissues and challenges in completing the design of, and deploying,such a system.</t>
