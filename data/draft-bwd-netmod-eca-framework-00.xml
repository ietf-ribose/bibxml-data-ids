    <abstract>
      <t>Event-driven management is meant to provide a useful method to monitor state change of managed objects and resources, and facilitate automatic triggering of a response to events, based on an established set of rules. This would provide rapid autonomic responses to specific conditions, enabling self-management behaviors, including: self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimization, and self- protection. This document provides a framework that describes the architecture for supporting event-driven management of managed object state across devices. It does not describe specific protocols or protocol extensions needed to realize the objectives and capabilities discussed in the document.</t>
