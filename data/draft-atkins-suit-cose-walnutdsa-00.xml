      <t>This document specifies the conventions for using the Walnut Digital Signature Algorithm (WalnutDSA) for digital signatures with the CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) syntax. WalnutDSA is a lightweight, quantum-resistant signature scheme based on Group Theoretic Cryptography (see [WALNUTDSA] and [WALNUTSPEC]) with implementation and computational efficiency of signature verification in constrained environments, even on 8- and 16-bit platforms.</t>
