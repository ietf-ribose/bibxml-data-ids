      <t>As the group communication become more important, the special label should be allocated in support of group management and maintenance. The allocation mechanism of group label can be applied to a point-to- multipoint communication in MPLS networks. Currently used label is locally significant, while this special label should be common object within a single MPLS domain. This document specifies the allocation mechanism of group label in order to perform unidirectional point-to- multipoint communication.</t>
