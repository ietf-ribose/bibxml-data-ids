      <t>This document specifies a fully-qualified domain name in the Domain Name System (DNS) that can be relied upon never to exist. The availability of a name in the DNS which is guaranteed not to exist has useful operational applications. This document also provides a procedural framework for other names that have special characteristics to be reserved, and for those special characteristics to be codified as modifications to the normal ARPA administration process.</t>
