      <t>Network tuning is usually performed after the network design is completed, but should also be done at intervals during the life cycle of the network. There are four basic areas that directly affect the efficiency of the network and its associated throughput: Frame and packet size optimization Segmentation avoidance or limitation Minimization of device delay Window sizing to avoid degradation This draft has been written to document for the internet community a basic overview of network tuning and its benefits.</t>
