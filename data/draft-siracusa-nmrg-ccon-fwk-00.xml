    <abstract>
      <t>The increased complexity in the management of highly heterogeneous optical networks is recently forcing vendors and providers to look for novel mechanisms which diminish the manual intervention by favoring the autonomous execution of several operational tasks, especially when dealing with network congestion or failure events. The adoption of cognitive techniques in networking envisions a network which is able to adapt itself to current or forecasted conditions by taking into account previous history, and which is able to act proactively, rather than reactively, in order to avoid problems before they arise. In this document, a novel architectural framework that introduces cognitive techniques in the optical networking domain is described, and several use cases provided to emphasize its effectiveness.</t>
