      <t>The traditional model for DNS is that authoritative servers would read DNS data from static zone files and use that to answer DNS queries. Modern DNS servers do not act in this way, and their answers are created dynamically - either periodically or at query time. This document presents a taxonomy breaking down the most common and useful methods used to customize responses on the authortiative side, as well as a survey of implementations by current large authoritative operators.</t>
