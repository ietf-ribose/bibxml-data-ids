      <t>This document describes a cryptographic transform which uses a stream cipher (which can generate keystream segments in arbitrary order) and a universal hash function to provide both privacy and authentication together, or either security service separately. This transform is efficient, provably secure, appropriate for network security, and is believed to be patent free.</t>
