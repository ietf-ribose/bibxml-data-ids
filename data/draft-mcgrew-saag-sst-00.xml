      <t>This document describes a cryptographic transform which uses astream cipher (which can generate keystream segments in arbitraryorder) and a universal hash function to provide both privacy andauthentication together, or either security service separately.This transform is efficient, provably secure, appropriate fornetwork security, and is believed to be patent free.</t>
