      <t>Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a method for forwardingpackets that uses short, fixed-length values carried by packets,called labels, to determine packet nexthops ([MPLS-FRAMEWORK],[MPLS-ARCH]). A fundamental concept in MPLS is that two LabelSwitching Routers (LSRs) must agree on the meaning of the labels usedto forward traffic between and through them. This commonunderstanding is achieved by using a set of procedures, called alabel distribution protocol, by which one LSR informs another oflabel bindings it has made. This document describes theapplicability of a set of such procedures called LDP (for LabelDistribution Protocol) [LDP].</t>
