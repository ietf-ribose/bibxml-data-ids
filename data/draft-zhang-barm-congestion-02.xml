      <t>This document specifies Binomial congestion control At Receivers for Multicast (BARM). BARM is a single rate multicast congestion control protocol for streaming media applications in the best effort Internet environment. Combining aspects of window-based and rate-based congestion control, the protocol shifts most of the congestion control mechanisms to multicast receivers. A congestion window is maintained and updated by each receiver independently according to TCP-friendly binomial algorithm, and is converted to the expected sending rate which is then fed back to the sender if permitted. To suppress feedback implosion, a representative receiver is selected among receivers and a distributed suppression mechanism is used. BARM has good TCP-friendliness, smoothness, scalability, and acceptable responsiveness.</t>
