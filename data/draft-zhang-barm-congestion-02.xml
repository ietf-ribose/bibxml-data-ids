      <t>This document specifies Binomial congestion control At Receivers forMulticast (BARM). BARM is a single rate multicast congestion controlprotocol for streaming media applications in the best effort Internetenvironment. Combining aspects of window-based and rate-based congestioncontrol, the protocol shifts most of the congestion control mechanismsto multicast receivers. A congestion window is maintained and updatedby each receiver independently according to TCP-friendly binomialalgorithm, and is converted to the expected sending rate which is thenfed back to the sender if permitted. To suppress feedback implosion, arepresentative receiver is selected among receivers and a distributedsuppression mechanism is used. BARM has good TCP-friendliness,smoothness, scalability, and acceptable responsiveness.</t>
