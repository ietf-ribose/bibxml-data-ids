      <t>Work has been progressing in the Common Control and MeasurementProtocol (CCAMP) working group on the application of MPLS technologyto non-packet switching networks. Development of the GeneralizedMPLS (GMPLS) signaling draft [1] has allowed for Optical, SONET/SDH,and spatial switching systems to be controlled using IP protocols.In a GMPLS network, the path that a TDM connection will use isdeveloped using constraint based routing. The developed routeutilizes TDM link state information announced via OSPF or IS-IS byother nodes in the network. However, a node cannot advertise theexistence of a link without first identifying the remote nodeconnected to the link and the capabilities of the neighboring node.In a packet network, this function would typically be accomplishedusing OSPF or IS-IS Hello messages repeated every 10 or so seconds.However, the TDM link cannot transmit similar messages because theport terminating the link cannot be shared between a TDM serviceuser and the OSPF/IS-IS termination function.</t>
