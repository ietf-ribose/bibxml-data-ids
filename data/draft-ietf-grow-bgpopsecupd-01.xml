    <abstract>
      <t>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the protocol almost exclusively used in the Internet to exchange routing information between network domains. Due to this central nature, it is important to understand the security and reliability measures that can and should be deployed to prevent accidental or intentional routing disturbances. Previously, security considerations for BGP have been described in RFC7454 / BCP194. Since the publications of RFC7454 / BCP194, several developments and changes in operational practice took place that warrant an update of these best current practices. This document replaces RFC7454 / BCP194, reiterating the best practices for BGP security from that document and adding new practices and recommendations that emerged since its publication. This document provides a comprehensive list of Internet specific BGP security and reliability related best practices as of the time of publication. It specifically does not cover other uses of BGP, e.g., in a datacenter context. While the recommendations in this document are, in general, best practices, operators still need to carefully weigh individual measures vs. their local network requirements before implementing them. Also, as with BCP194, best practices outlined in this document may have changed since its publication.</t>
