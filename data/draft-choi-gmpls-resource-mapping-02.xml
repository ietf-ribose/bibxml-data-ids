      <t>The new forms of label used in GMPLS to deal with the widening scope of MPLS into the optical and time domain are collectively referred to as a 'Generalized Label' related to resource. In this draft, we describe the relationship of labels and resources. We also describe the resource mapping methods for GMPLS with heterogeneous interfaces. Particularly we present the methods for resource mapping at incoming and outgoing switching interface where data flows with label of a different granularity are aggregated into the data flow of large bandwidth.</t>
