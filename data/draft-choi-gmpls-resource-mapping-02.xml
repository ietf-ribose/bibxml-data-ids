      <t>The new forms of label used in GMPLS to deal with the widening scope of MPLS into the optical and time domain are collectively referred toas a 'Generalized Label' related to resource. In this draft, wedescribe the relationship of labels and resources. We also describethe resource mapping methods for GMPLS with heterogeneous interfaces.Particularly we present the methods for resource mapping at incomingand outgoing switching interface where data flows with label of adifferent granularity are aggregated into the data flow of largebandwidth.</t>
