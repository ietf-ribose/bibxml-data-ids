      <t>CoAP is a RESTful transfer protocol for constrained nodes and networks. In many applications, CoAP will be used via cross-protocol proxies from HTTP clients. HTTP client libraries may make it hard to operate an HTTP-CoAP forward proxy by not providing a way to put a CoAP URI on the HTTP Request-Line; reverse-proxying may therefore lead to wider applicability of a proxy. This specification will define a convention for URIs operating such a HTTP-CoAP reverse proxy. The current version of this specification is a placeholder only. It is meant to pick up http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/core/trac/ticket/259 and provide a home for its considerations. It might be merged with other documents later.</t>
