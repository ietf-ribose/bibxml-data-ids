      <t>This contribution describes an IP Telephony Routing Protocol (ITRP)for intra-ITAD communications. ITRP is a SINGLE protocol that isused between gateways and servers as well as among servers. It usesdiscovery, registration, update, keep-alive, confirmation, anderror-notification messages. The connectionless (e.g., UDP)transport is used and, if needed, multicasting can be used insteadof flooding. The connection-oriented (e.g., TCP) transport can alsobe utilized. ITRP's operation is independent of any signalingprotocol and, can serve as a mechanism to provide the reachabilityinformation about alias addresses including telephone numbers. Theproposed message formats in ITRP are similar to TRIP.</t>
