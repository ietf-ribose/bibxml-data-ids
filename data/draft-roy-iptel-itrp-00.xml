      <t>This contribution describes an IP Telephony Routing Protocol (ITRP) for intra-ITAD communications. ITRP is a SINGLE protocol that is used between gateways and servers as well as among servers. It uses discovery, registration, update, keep-alive, confirmation, and error-notification messages. The connectionless (e.g., UDP) transport is used and, if needed, multicasting can be used instead of flooding. The connection-oriented (e.g., TCP) transport can also be utilized. ITRP's operation is independent of any signaling protocol and, can serve as a mechanism to provide the reachability information about alias addresses including telephone numbers. The proposed message formats in ITRP are similar to TRIP.</t>
