      <t>The RSVP [RFC2205] model for communicating requests to networkdevices along a datapath has proven useful for a variety of appli-cations beyond what the protocol designers envisioned, and whilethe architectural model generalizes well the protocol itself has anumber of features that limit its applicability to applicationsother than IntServ [RFC1633]. The NSIS working group is developinga modernized version that, among other things, is based on a 'two-layer' architecture that divides protocol function into transportand application. This document describes the transport protocol.</t>
