      <t>The RSVP [RFC2205] model for communicating requests to network devices along a datapath has proven useful for a variety of appli- cations beyond what the protocol designers envisioned, and while the architectural model generalizes well the protocol itself has a number of features that limit its applicability to applications other than IntServ [RFC1633]. The NSIS working group is developing a modernized version that, among other things, is based on a 'two- layer' architecture that divides protocol function into transport and application. This document describes the transport protocol.</t>
