      <t>This document introduces the concept of a SCHClet: a modular sub- function within the SCHC (Static Context Header Compression) framework. Inspired by chiplet architectures in hardware design, a SCHClet encapsulates a specific SCHC function—such as compression, fragmentation, or acknowledgments—as a self-contained unit. This modularization enables tailored implementations that avoid the overhead of deploying a full SCHC stack. By decomposing SCHC functionality into SCHClets, the framework becomes more adaptable, extensible, and suitable for a wider range of network environments—including, but not limited to, constrained networks. A system using SCHClets remains compliant with the SCHC framework and can interoperate with a full SCHC implementation, provided compatible configuration parameters are used. Each SCHClet is defined by the SCHC Profiles and configuration parameters necessary for interoperability. It operates within a single Stratum and a single SCHC Instance. For example, a device may implement only the NoAck fragmentation mode as a standalone SCHClet, potentially with fixed parameters. This modular approach simplifies development, reduces resource demands, and provides a framework for future extensibility of the SCHC architecture.</t>
