      <t>Given the open nature of the Internet today, application protocolsrequire strong security. IPsec's wire protocols appear to meet therequirements of many protocols. The lack of a common model forapplication-layer interfaces has complicated use of IPsec by upper-layer protocols. This document provides an overview of facilitieswhich a host IPsec implementation should provide to applications toallow them to both observe and influence how IPsec protects theircommunications.</t>
