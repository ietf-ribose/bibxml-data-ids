      <t>Forward Secrecy for the Extensible Authentication Protocol Method for Authentication and Key Agreement (EAP-AKA' FS) is specified in [I-D.ietf-emu-aka-pfs], providing updates to [RFC9048] with an optional extension that offers ephemeral key exchange using the traditional Ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE) key agreement algorithm for achieving perfect forward secrecy (PFS). However, it is susceptible to future threats from Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers, which could potentially compromise a traditional ephemeral public key. If the adversary has also obtained knowledge of the long-term key and ephemeral public key, it could compromise session keys generated as part of the authentication run in EAP-AKA'. This draft aims to enhance the security of EAP-AKA' FS making it quantum-safe using Post-Quantum Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (PQ- KEMs).</t>
