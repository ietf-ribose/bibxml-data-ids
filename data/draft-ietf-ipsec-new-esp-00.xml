      <t>The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) header is designed to provide a mix of optional security services in IPv4 and IPv6. ESP may be applied alone, in combination with the IP Authentication Header (AH) [KA97b], or in a nested fashion, e.g., through the use of tunnel mode (see below). Security services can be provided between a pair of communicating hosts, between a pair of communicating security gateways, or between a security gateway and a host. For more details on how to use ESP and AH in various network environments, see 'Security Architecture for the Internet Protocol' [KA97a].</t>
