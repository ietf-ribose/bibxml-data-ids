      <t>This document presents a routing method through sending detectionframes including address of destination node to the neighbor nodes toreduce delay of data transmission because of the dormant nodes willincrease data transmission delay in low power and lossynetworks(LLNs). When receives the response from the neighbor nodes,the sending node can select a neighboring node as the next hop nodeto sent data, which has the lower cost parameter than the costparameter between the sending node and the destination node stored inthe routing table of sending node. This routing method finds a routein real-time by broadcasting detection frames. As long as anyneighbor node that can reach the destination is active, data can besent and then the data transmission delay will be reduced.</t>
