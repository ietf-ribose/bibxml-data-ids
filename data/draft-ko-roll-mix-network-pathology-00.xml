      <t>Nodes can run RPL in storing or non-storing modes for downward routing. When a downward-bound packet traverses a node running in storing to a node running in non-storing mode, there is a routing pathology that makes the packet bounce between the two nodes. Due to this pathology, the packet never reaches the destination if it lies beyond these nodes in the multi-hop path. The solution is to mandate that all the nodes parse and interpret source routing headers and storing nodes to sometimes act like non-storing mode root.</t>
