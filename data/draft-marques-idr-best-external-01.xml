      <t>The base BGP specifications prevent a BGP speaker from advertisingany route that is not the best route for a BGP destination. Thisdocument specifies a modification of this rule. Routes are dividedinto two categories, "external" and "internal". A specification isprovided for choosing a "best external route" (for a particular valueof the Network Layer Reachability Information). A BGP speaker isthen allowed to advertise its "best external route" to its internalBGP peers, even if that is not the best route for the destination.The document explains why advertising the best external route canimprove convergence time without causing routing loops. Additionalbenefits include reduction of inter-domain churn and avoidance ofpermanent route oscillation. The document also generalizes thenotions of "internal" and "external" so that they can be applied toRoute Reflector Clusters and Autonomous System Confederations.</t>
