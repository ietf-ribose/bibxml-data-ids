      <t>This document describes the Killer Reservation Problem encountered when merging RSVP reservation requests. These requests get merged as they travel up the multicast distribution tree, losing information about individual requests. A request, which would have succeeded on its own, may suffer denial of service when the 'merged request' fails admission control. This is the problem for which we present different solutions.</t>
