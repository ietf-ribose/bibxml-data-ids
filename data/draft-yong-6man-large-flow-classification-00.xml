      <t>Network traffic has shown the combination of few very high bitrate flows (large flow) and huge amount of very low bit flows(small flow), which causes uneven load balance over ECMP paths.Differentiating large flow and small flow packets in IP/MPLSnetworks enables enhanced ECMP transport. Enhanced ECMP appliesdifferent distribution methods to large flow packets and smallflow packets to improve the load balance. The classification alsoenables an effective congestion control. This draft proposes largeflow classification in IPv6 protocol for this purpose.</t>
