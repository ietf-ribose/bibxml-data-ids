      <t>Network traffic has shown the combination of few very high bit rate flows (large flow) and huge amount of very low bit flows (small flow), which causes uneven load balance over ECMP paths. Differentiating large flow and small flow packets in IP/MPLS networks enables enhanced ECMP transport. Enhanced ECMP applies different distribution methods to large flow packets and small flow packets to improve the load balance. The classification also enables an effective congestion control. This draft proposes large flow classification in IPv6 protocol for this purpose.</t>
