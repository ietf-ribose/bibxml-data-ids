      <t>This document proposes a mapping for PMIP QoS parameters of each mobility session that a WLC configures on a WiFi Access Point. In particular there is a recommendation for consistent mapping between DSCP and QCI to 802.11e parameters. The document also discusses that these QoS parameters can be used by the WiFi Access Point to provide priority based services based on contention in WiFi radio network or reservation based services in contention free cycles in the WiFi radio network.</t>
