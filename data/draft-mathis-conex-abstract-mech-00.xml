      <t>This document describes an abstract mechanism by which senders informthe network about the congestion encountered by packets earlier inthe same flow. Today, the network may signal congestion to thereceiver by ECN markings or by dropping packets, and the receiver maypass this information back to the sender in transport-layer feedback.The mechanism to be developed by the ConEx WG will enable the senderto also relay this congestion information back into the network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total level of congestion isvisible to all IP devices along the path, from where it could, forexample, be provided as input to traffic management.</t>
