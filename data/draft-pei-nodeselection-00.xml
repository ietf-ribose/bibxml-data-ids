    <abstract>
      <t>Based on the hybrid spectrum sensing method, this paper proposes a SENS node selection algorithm which effectively reduces the number of nodes participated in spectrum sensing. The algorithm reduces the loads and energy consumption of the cognitive wireless sensor networks. It conforms to the development trend of current cognitive wireless sensor networks. At the same time, This method is also suitable for traditional wireless sensor networks. This algorithm which considers the perception of energy consumption and performance parameters of nodes forms a node priority function, The network selects the nodes according to the priority of nodes, It reduces energy consumption and improves the spectrum sensing performance. In the cooperative spectrum sensing, sensor nodes transmit the sensing results to the fusion center. Moreover, this paper uses the "OR" standard, the node whose local sensing decision is "1" transmits the local sensing result to the fusion center. So it can reduce the energy consumption in the process of spectrum sensing and achieve the purpose of energy saving.</t>
