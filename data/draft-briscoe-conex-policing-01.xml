      <t>This document describes why policing using congestion information can isolate users from network performance degradation due to each other's usage, but without losing the multiplexing benefits of a LAN- style network where anyone can use any amount of any resource. Extensive numerical examples and diagrams are given. The document is agnostic to how the congestion information reaches the policer. The congestion exposure (ConEX) protocol is recommended, but other tunnel feedback mechanisms have been proposed.</t>
