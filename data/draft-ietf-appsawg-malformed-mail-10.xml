      <t>Although Internet mail formats have been precisely defined since the 1970s, authoring and handling software often show only mild conformance to the specifications. The malformed messages that result are non-standard.

This document includes a collection of the best advice available regarding a variety of common malformed mail situations, to be used as implementation guidance.</t>
