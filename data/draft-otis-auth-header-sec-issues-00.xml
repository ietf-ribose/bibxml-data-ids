      <t>The proposed [I-D.kucherawy-sender-auth-header] defines a headerfield used to capture email verification results of borderreceptions. These results are then conveyed to Mail User Agents(MUA) and downstream filters. This header field is to augmentfiltering decisions and message annotations that can be made visibleto recipients. The annotations could affirm originating domains orcontent integrity when based upon Domainkeys or DKIM results, or adomain's authorization of a publicly transmitting SMTP client IPaddress when based upon Sender-ID or SPF results, or that the SMTPclient IP address maps to a matching domain within the DNS reversenamespace.Although the draft acknowledges the conflation of authorization withauthentication in section 1.5.2, and explicitly declares Sender-IDand SPF as the authorization of the transmitting SMTP client, itstill fails to offer the authenticated entity being trusted in theexchange, the IP address of the SMTP client. An authenticated entityis essential for reputation assessments which section 4.1 indicatesshould be made prior to results being revealed. A reputation checkis often a necessary step to mitigate abuse and fraud. Even so, theheader offers no assurance that any reputation check has been made,nor does it ensure that the trusted entity, the IP address of theSMTP client, can be determined by the MUA or downstream filter.</t>
