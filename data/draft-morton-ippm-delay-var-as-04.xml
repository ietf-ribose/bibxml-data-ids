      <t>Packet delay variation metrics appear in many different standardsdocuments. The metric definition in RFC 3393 has considerableflexibility, and it allows multiple formulations of delay variationthrough the specification of different packet selection functions.Although flexibility provides wide coverage and room for new ideas,it can make comparisons of independent implementations moredifficult. Two different formulations of delay variation have comeinto wide use in the context of active measurements. This memoexamines a range of circumstances for active measurements of delayvariation and their uses, and recommends which of the two forms isbest matched to particular conditions and tasks.</t>
