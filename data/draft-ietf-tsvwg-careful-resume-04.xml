    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a cautious method for IETF transports that enables fast startup of congestion control for a wide range of connections or reconnections. It reuses a set of computed congestion control parameters that are based on previously observed path characteristics between the same pair of transport endpoints. These parameters are stored, allowing them to be later used to modify the congestion control behavior of a subsequent connection. It discusses assumptions and defines requirements for how a sender utilizes these parameters to provide opportunities for a connection to more rapidly get up to speed and rapidly utilize available capacity. It discusses how use of the method impacts the capacity at a shared network bottleneck and the safe response that is needed after any indication that the new rate is inappropriate.</t>
