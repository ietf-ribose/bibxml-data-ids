      <t>This memo describes an IP Multicast Shortcut Service (IMSS) over a large ATM cloud. The service enables cut-through routing between routers serving different Logical IP Subnets (LISs). The presented solution is complementary to MARS [2], adopted as the IETF standard solution for IP multicast over ATM. IMSS consists of two orthogonal components: CONnection-oriented Group address RESolution Service (CONGRESS) and IP multicast SErvice for Non-broadcast Access Networking TEchnology (IP-SENATE). An IP class D address is resolved into a set of addresses of multicast routers that should receive the multicast traffic targeted to this class D address. This task is accomplished using CONGRESS. The cut-through routing decisions and actual data transmission are performed by IP- SENATE. IMSS preserves the classical LIS model [8]. The scope of IMSS is to facilitate inter-LIS cut-through routing, while MARS provides tools for the intra-LIS IP multicast.</t>
