      <t>The Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) is a new naming and addressing architecture to solve the Internet's routing scaling problem. It separates global routing in the Internet from local routing and naming in end-user networks. The basic LISP architecture does not support mobility. The mobility extension LISP Mobile Node (LISP-MN) describes a mechanism that extends LISP to support mobile nodes and enables them to roam into LISP and non-LISP networks while being reachable under the same address. Currently, LISP-MN does not support networks that use network address translation (NAT). This document presents an extension for LISP-MN that makes LISP mobile nodes behind a NAT globally reachable.</t>
