      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is a network based mobility management protocol which provides IP mobility service to a host in a way which is transparent to the host itself. This document analyses the scenario in which the mobile node equipped with multiple network interfaces roams in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain consisting of multiple access networks. If the mobile node wants to preserve IP session continuity across different network interfaces as it moves from one access network to another it needs to be enhanced with a new, PMIPv6- specific functionality. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</t>
