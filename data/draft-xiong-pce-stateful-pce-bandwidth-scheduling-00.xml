      <t>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. The stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) using PCEP. This document proposes a set of extensions for the stateful PCE, so as to enable bandwidth scheduling for LSP and adjust the bandwidth based on the customers' scheduled bandwidth requirement of a traffic service in a centralized network environment. A bandwidth scheduled LSP can be adjusted to the new bandwidth at its starting time and adjusted back to the original bandwidth at its ending time.</t>
