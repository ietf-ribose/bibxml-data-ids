      <t>A framework for providing various Layer 1 and Layer 2 services over a Packet Switched Network has been described in [3]. This draft provides encapsulation formats and guidelines for transporting a variety of ATM services over a PSN. This draft includes refinements to draft-brayley-pwe3-atm-service that was previously submitted to the PWE3 working group. It reuses the ATM cell and AAL5 encapsulation defined in the original martini encapsulation draft [7], but includes an applicability statement for each service along with ATM OAM handling and QoS guidelines.</t>
