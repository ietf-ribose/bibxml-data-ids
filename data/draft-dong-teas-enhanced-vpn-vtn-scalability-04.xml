    <abstract>
      <t>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to meet the needs of some customers or applications, including the customers and applications that are associated with 5G, which requires connectivity services with advanced characteristics, such as the assurance of some Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and specific Service Level Expectations (SLEs). VPN+ could be used for network slice realization both in the context of 5G and in more generic scenarios, such as enterprise services which have requirement on the performance assurance. With the demand for VPN+ services increases, scalability would become an important factor for the large scale deployment of VPN+. This document describes the scalability considerations about the network control plane and data plane in enabling VPN+ services, some optimization mechanisms are also proposed.</t>
