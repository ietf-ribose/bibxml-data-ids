      <t>This draft specifies IP mobility support protocol for moving network including mobile nodes (MNs) over Proxy Mobile IPv6 network by introducing a new functional entity, mobile MAG (mMAG) on the moving network. The mMAG takes charges of MN's movement detection, binding update on behalf of MNs as a mobile access gateway (MAG) does in PMIPv6 infrastructure. This protocol also supports IP session continuity for a mobile node to move between mobile network and fixed MAG. This protocol does not require any modification or extension on the MN.</t>
