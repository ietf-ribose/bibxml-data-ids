      <t>More and more operators have deployed or are about to deploy IPv6 transition technologies such as DS-lite, MAP, LAFT6, etc. The fundamental elements of these technologies are Network Address Translation (NAT) and Tunneling. The elements of these transition technologies may be subject to a number of attacks, unless appropriate mitigations are in place. This memo discusses the security implications of the aforementioned points, and additionally, provides a number of operational mitigations that could be deployed against these attacks.</t>
