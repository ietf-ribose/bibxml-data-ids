      <t>This draft introduces the concept of ARC, a two-edged routing construct that forms its own fault isolation and recovery domain. The new paradigm can be leveraged to improve the network utilization and resiliency for unicast and multicast traffic in multiple environments, and is optimized to compute short reroute paths in case of breakages.</t>
