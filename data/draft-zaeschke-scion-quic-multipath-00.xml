    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides informational guidance for using the Multipath Extension for QUIC with the SCION networking technology. SCION is an inter-domain routing protocol that supports path-aware multi-path networking. The multiple paths and their associated path information offered by SCION provide opportunities as well as challenges for combining QUIC-MP with SCION. This document explores various aspects of this combination, such as algorithms for congestion control, RTT estimation, and general application scenarios. In addition, it provides techniques and guidance to maintain the security of QUIC-MP and SCION, and to leverage path-aware multi-path networking with QUIC-MP.</t>
