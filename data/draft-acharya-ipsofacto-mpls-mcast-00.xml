      <t>Multicast support in a MPLS network has yet to be defined. This document discusses both dense-mode and sparse-mode IP multicast within the context of a MPLS network. Unlike unicast routing, dense-mode multicast routing trees are established in a data-driven manner and it is not possible to topologically aggregate such trees, which are rooted at different sources. In sparse-mode multicast, source-specific trees may coexist with a core/shared tree, and it is not possible to assign a common label to traffic from different sources on a branch of the shared tree. This leads us to suggest a per-source traffic-driven label allocation scheme for supporting all three types of multicast (dense mode, shared tree, source tree) routing trees in a MPLS network.</t>
