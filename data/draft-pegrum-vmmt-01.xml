    <abstract>
      <t>For many carrier's, the implementation of Virtual Private Network (VPN) services using current IP Tunneling technology is problematic because of onerous configuration requirements. The VPMT is an protocol for the dynammic distribution of VPN information throughout a shared network, which in turn allows the automatic formation of point to multi-point tunnels between VPN routers. The method described in this internet draft is intended for single AS where the AS administrator is a trusted third party. Traffic seperation is maintained between VPNs.</t>
