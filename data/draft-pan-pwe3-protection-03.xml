      <t>This document describes a mechanism that helps to protect and recover user traffic when carried over pseudo-wires. The mechanism requires some minor modification to the existing pseudo-wire setup procedure, and is fully backward compatible. The proposed mechanism allows the network operators to setup one or multiple backup pseudo-wires to protect a working pseudo-wire. Upon network failure, user traffic can be switched over to the next "best" pseudo-wire base on preference levels. This document first describes the motivation of the work base on the discussions with a number of carriers. Then we define the protocol extension itself.</t>
