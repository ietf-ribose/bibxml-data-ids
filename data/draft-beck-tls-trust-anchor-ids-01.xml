    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the TLS Trust Anchors extension, a mechanism for relying parties and subscribers to convey trusted certification authorities. It describes individual certification authorities more succinctly than the TLS Certificate Authorities extension. Additionally, to support TLS clients with many trusted certification authorities, it supports a mode where servers describe their available certification paths and the client selects from them. Servers may describe this during connection setup, or in DNS for lower latency.</t>
