      <t>The Multicast Dissemination Protocol (MDP) is a protocol framework designed to provide reliable multicast data and file delivery ser- vices on top of the generic UDP/IP multicast transport [1]. MDP is well suited for reliable multicast bulk transfer of data across a heterogeneous internetwork. Further enhancements made to the pro- tocol are suitable for a range of network environments, including wireless internetwork environments. At its core, MDP is an effi- cient negative acknowledgement (NACK) based reliable multicast pro- tocol that leverages erasure-based coding in ways to improve pro- tocol efficiency and robustness. MDP also includes an optional adaptive end-to-end rate-based congestion control mode that is to operate with competing flows (e.g., TCP sessions or other conges- tion aware flows). This document describes the protocol messages, building blocks, general operation, and optional modes of the pre- sent MDP instantiation and implementation.</t>
