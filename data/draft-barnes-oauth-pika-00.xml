      <t>A relying party verifying a JSON Web Token (JWT) needs to verify that the public key used to verify the signature legitimately represents the issuer represented in the "iss" claim of the JWT. Today, relying parties commonly use the "iss" claim to fetch a set of authorized signing keys over HTTPS, relying on the security of HTTPS to establish the authority of the downloaded keys for that issuer. The ephemerality of this proof of authority makes it unsuitable for use cases where a JWT might need to be verified for some time. In this document, we define a format for Proofs of Issuer Key Authority, which establish the authority of a key using a signed object instead of an HTTPS connection.</t>
