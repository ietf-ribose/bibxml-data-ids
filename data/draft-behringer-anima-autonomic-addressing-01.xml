      <t>This document describes a generic IPv6 addressing scheme which is suitable for autonomic nodes, where node addressing must not depend on a centrally managed scheme. It assumes a unique domain name and device name, and automatically derives a unique IPv6 address from those. The scheme allows for a flat address hierarchy as well as optionally, when required, the definition of zones which are aggregatable.</t>
