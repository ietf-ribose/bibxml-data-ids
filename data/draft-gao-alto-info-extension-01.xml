      <t>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol enables the distribution of certain network information to applications. Hence, a fundamental functionality of an ALTO server is to collect general network information, especially from multiple "information sources". In this document, we propose a preliminary solution to standardize the process of information collection for ALTO servers by extending the ALTO protocol with some new services, which can also serve as a unified approach of network information distribution.</t>
