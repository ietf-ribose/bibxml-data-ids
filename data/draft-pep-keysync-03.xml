    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the pEp KeySync protocol, which is designed to perform secure peer-to-peer synchronization of private keys across devices belonging to the same user. Modern users of messaging systems typically have multiple devices for communicating, and attempting to use encryption on all of these devices often leads to situations where messages cannot be decrypted on a given device due to missing private key data. Current approaches to resolve key synchronicity issues are cumbersome and potentially insecure. The pEp KeySync protocol is designed to facilitate this personal key synchronization in a user-friendly manner.</t>
