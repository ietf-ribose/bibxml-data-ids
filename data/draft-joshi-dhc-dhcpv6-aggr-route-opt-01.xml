      <t>The Aggregate Route option provides a mechanism for a requestor to retrieve an aggregate route(s) from a DHCPv6 server using the information-request message. The aggregate route is a single route representing multiple prefixes delegated by a DHCP server using Prefix Delegation, and maybe advertised using routing protocols instead of individual routes learnt from DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation. This document specifies the data contained in aggregate route option as well as the behavior of Requestor and DHCPv6 Server in requesting and processing of this option.</t>
