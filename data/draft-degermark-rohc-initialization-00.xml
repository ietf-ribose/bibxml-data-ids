      <t>This is an individual contribution to the IETF ROHC WG. The documentproposes a format for the initialization headers that establish thestatic (and dynamic) part of ROHC context. The method is intended tobe general and extensible, and to deal well with IPv6 extensionheaders, headers used by Mobile IP, and IPSEC headers. All theseheaders must be dealt with according to the ROHC requirements, butare not handled by existing proposals.Comments should be sent to the ROHC WG, rohc@cdt.luth.se</t>
