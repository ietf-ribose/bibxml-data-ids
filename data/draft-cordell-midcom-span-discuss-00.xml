      <t>This document collects points of discussion surrounding the pre-midcom SPAN deliverable (SPAN = Simple Protocol for Augmenting NATs). As far as possible it is intended to act as a collation point for facts surrounding the SPAN deliverable. Where a discussion item is not black and white it attempts to collate opinion from all angles as far as the author is able to without bias. It does not draw conclusions of any sort.</t>
