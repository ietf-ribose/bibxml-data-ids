      <t>Applications routinely open multiple TCP connections. For example,P2P applications maintain connections to a number of different peersand web browsers perform concurrent download from the same webserver. Application designers pursue different goals when doing so:P2P apps need to maintain a well-connected mesh in the swarm whileweb browsers mainly use multiple connections to parallelize requeststhat involve application latency on the web server side. Howeverthis practice also has impacts to the host and the network as awhole. For example, an application can obtain a larger fraction ofthe bottleneck than if it had used fewer connections. Althoughcapacity is the most commonly considered bottleneck resource,middlebox state table entries are also an important resource for anend system communication.This document clarifies the current practices of application designinvolving concurrent TCP connections and reasons behind them, anddiscusses the tradeoffs surrounding their use, whether to onedestination or to different destinations. Other resource types mayexist, and the guidelines are expected to comprehensively discussthem.</t>
