    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents an approach for organizing YANG models in a comprehensive structure that defines how individual models may be composed to configure and operate network infrastructure and services. The structure is itself represented as a YANG model rooted at a device, with all of the related component models logically organized in a way that is operationally intuitive. This document is derived from work submitted to the IETF by members of the informal OpenConfig working group of network operators and is a product of the Routing Area YANG Architecture design team.</t>
