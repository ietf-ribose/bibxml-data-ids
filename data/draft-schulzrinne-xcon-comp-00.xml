      <t>The Conference Object Manipulation Protocol (COMP) allows to create, change and delete objects related to centralized conferences, including participants, their media and their roles. The protocol relies on web services and SIP event notification as its infrastructure, but can control conferences that use any signaling protocol to invite users.</t>
