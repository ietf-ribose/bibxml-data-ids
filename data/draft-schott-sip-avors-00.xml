      <t>This document describes the AVORS (Avoiding Registration Storms) concept that allows the resumption of active registrations. The concept can be mapped on any architecture having a distributed structure and could work for different protocols. The concept is exemplary explained here regarding an architecture for voice and is mapped on a 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) architecture. This document describes the AVORS (Avoiding Registration Storms) concept that allows the resumption of active UE (User Equipment) registrations on other Outbound Proxies (P-CSCF) within the SIP voice architecture. The AVORS concept increases service continuity, improves network resilience, and offers savings potential. Additionally, this document gives an outlook regarding stateless voice architectures, load calculation aspects, and Service Based Interfaces (SBI) in context data base interworking. Security aspects are considered in the security chapter. As stated above the AVORS principle is not only limited to the SIP protocol and could be adopted by other protocols.</t>
