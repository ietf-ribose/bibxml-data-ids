      <t>According to the significant concepts and research challenges described in RFC7927, we think that the multi-service tag technology is a effective name mechanism for video contents in ICN. Because the video traffic is the primary traffic transferred in the Internet, it will tremendously promote the current Internet architecture to the ICN architecture that the name mechanism for the video contents is established. This document discusses the consideration for the design of multi-service tag in ICN and how to use the multi-service tag technology to establish the name mechanism for the video contents. This document also gives the typical cases which use the above name mechanism to improve the content distribution efficiency and cache system efficiency.</t>
