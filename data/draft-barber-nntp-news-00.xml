      <t>The Network News Transport Protocol has been in use in the Internet for a decade and remains one of the most popular protocols (by volume) in use today. This document is a replacement for RFC 977 and officially updates the protocol specification. It clarifies some vagueness in RFC 977, includes some new base functionality and provides a specific mechanism to add standardized extensions to NNTP.</t>
