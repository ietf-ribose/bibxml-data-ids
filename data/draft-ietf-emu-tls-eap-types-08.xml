      <t>EAP-TLS (RFC 5216) has been updated for TLS 1.3 in RFC 9190. Many other EAP types also depend on TLS, such as EAP-FAST (RFC 4851), EAP- TTLS (RFC 5281), TEAP (RFC 7170), and possibly many vendor specific EAP methods. This document updates those methods in order to use the new key derivation methods available in TLS 1.3. Additional changes necessitated by TLS 1.3 are also discussed.</t>
