    <abstract>
      <t>Ethernet VPN (EVPN) and Provider Backbone EVPN (PBB-EVPN) introduce a comprehensive suite of solutions for delivering Ethernet services over MPLS/IP networks. These solutions offer advanced features, including multi-homing capabilities. Specifically, they support Single-Active and All-Active redundancy modes for an Ethernet Segment (ES), which is defined as a collection of physical links connecting a multi-homed device or network to a set of Provider Edge (PE) devices. This document extends the concept of an Ethernet Segment by allowing an ES to be associated with a set of Ethernet Virtual Circuits (EVCs, such as VLANs) or other entities, including MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) or Pseudowires (PWs). This extended concept is referred to as Virtual Ethernet Segments (vES). This draft outlines the requirements and necessary extensions to support vES in both EVPN and PBB-EVPN.</t>
