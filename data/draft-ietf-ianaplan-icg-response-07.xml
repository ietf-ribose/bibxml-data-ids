      <t>The U.S. NTIA has solicited a request from ICANN to propose how the NTIA should end its oversight of the IANA functions. After broad consultations, ICANN has in turn created the IANA Stewardship Transition Coordination Group. That group solicited proposals for thre three major IANA functions: names, numbers, and protocol parameters. This document contains the IETF response to that solicitation for protocol parameters. It is meant to be included in an aggregate response to the NTIA alongside those for names and numbering resources that are being developed by their respective operational communities.</t>
