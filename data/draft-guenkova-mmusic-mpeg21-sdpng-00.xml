      <t>The delivery and the adaptation of multimedia content in distributed, heterogeneous environments, involving device and/or application mobility, require flexible control and management mechanisms in the terminals and/or in media gateways. MPEG-21 Digital Item Adaptation (DIA) provides normative description formats supporting the adaptation of so-called Digital Items, but it does not define interactions with existing transport and control technologies, in order to remain independent. This draft presents a practical approach for harmonizing MPEG-21 DIA application with Session Description Protocol next generation (SDPng). The proposed mechanism allows the definition of system configurations, performance constraints and adaptation information within the scope of SDPng using the format of MPEG-21 DIA. Furthermore, the converged format enables the integration of session management and negotiation protocols (e.g. Session Initiation Protocol - SIP) that use such enhanced SDPng descriptions within an MPEG-21 conformant environment.</t>
