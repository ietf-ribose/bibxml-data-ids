    <abstract>
      <t>Name-based routing in information-centric networks faces many challenges, one of which is the scalability challenge; in particular, content routers may not have sufficiently large FIB to store a large portion of name prefixes, even if the latter are aggressively aggregated. In many ICN designs routers have to rely on inefficient mechanisms (e.g., Interest broadcast in content-centric networks) in order to route requests. In this draft, we describe a hybrid, reactive routing approach, where we augment the information-centric network design with an Infrastructure Information Base (IIB) to reap the benefits of both name-based and infrastructure-based routing. Simulation-based evaluations demonstrate that this scheme can significantly improve the network scalability by cutting down the number of broadcast packets while maintaining the same level of the user-perceived latency.</t>
