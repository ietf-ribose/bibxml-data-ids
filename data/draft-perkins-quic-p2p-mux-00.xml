      <t>The QUIC transport protocol is intended to be a general purpose transport, but is currently defined for client-server operation only. To be applicable to all use cases, it needs to develop support for peer-to-peer connection establishment. This memo describes how this can be done, in outline form. Future work is needed to determine if such peer-to-peer use of QUIC is desirable and, if so, to define a complete and workable standard for peer-to-peer QUIC connection establishment.</t>
