    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents use cases that have a common feature in that they may be addressed by encoding network action indicators and associated ancillary data within MPLS packets. There are interest in extending the MPLS data plane to carry such indicators and ancillary data to address the use cases that are described in this document. The use cases described in this document are not an exhaustive set, but rather the ones that are actively discussed by members of the IETF MPLS, PALS, and DetNet working groups.</t>
