      <t>Specifically, WiFi has emerged as an important access technology for Multiple Service Operator (MSO) and mobile service provider. For mobile service provider, WiFi is preferred as a trusted access technology for service. It has became important to provide simple transition method expected for service via WiFi access. For example, tunnelling on the customer side aims at conveying WiFi service between a hotspot and the Service Gateway. GRE tunnel is an increasingly popular encapsulation choice because of simple encapsulation and easy implementation, especially in aforementioned environments. However, manual configuration is not suitable if there are large numbers of the end-points of GRE tunnels. This document proposes a dynamic-configured stateless GRE tunnel, which does not modify encapsulation format of GRE, but adds signaling for tunnel parameters discovery, such as address, GRE key etc.</t>
