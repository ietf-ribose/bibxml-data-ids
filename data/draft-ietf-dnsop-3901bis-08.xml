    <abstract>
      <t>This memo provides guidelines and documents Best Current Practice for operating authoritative DNS servers as well as recursive and stub DNS resolvers, given that queries and responses are carried in a mixed environment of IPv4 and IPv6 networks. This document recommends that authoritative DNS servers as well as recursive DNS resolvers support both IPv4 and IPv6. It furthermore provides guidance for how recursive DNS resolvers should select upstream DNS servers, if synthesized and non-synthesized IPv6 addresses are available. This document obsoletes RFC 3901.
