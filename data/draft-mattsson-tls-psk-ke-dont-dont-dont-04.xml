    <abstract>
      <t>Massive pervasive monitoring attacks using key exfiltration and made possible by key exchange without forward secrecy have been reported. If key exchange without Diffie-Hellman is used, static exfiltration of the long-term authentication keys enables passive attackers to compromise all past and future connections. Malicious actors can get access to long-term keys in different ways: physical attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks, espionage, or by simply demanding access to keying material with or without a court order. Exfiltration attacks are a major cybersecurity threat. If NULL encryption is used an on-path attacker can read all application data. The use of psk_ke and NULL encryption are not following zero trust principles of minimizing the impact of breach and governments have already made deadlines for their deprecation. This document sets the Recommended values of psk_ke, TLS_SHA256_SHA256, TLS_SHA384_SHA384, ffdhe2048 to "D" and the Recommended values of rsa_pkcs1_sha256, rsa_pkcs1_sha384, and rsa_pkcs1_sha512 to "N".</t>
