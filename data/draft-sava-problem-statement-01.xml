      <t>This document outlines the problems that the Source Address Verification Architecture (SAVA) initiative plans to solve. It examines the current state in the internet, looks at current best practices, and discusses why the current approaches are unlikely to ever solve the problem of IP address spoofing. It also discusses some of the problems that SAVA should NOT attempt to solve.</t>
