      <t>In March 2001, [RFC 3077] was published and describes a protocol which allows to integrate unidirectional links in the Internet. Since then, a number of experimentations and deployements using this protocol have been led. This document presents various protocols, e.g. layer 2 and layer 3 protocols, which have been commonly used over [RFC 3077] in a satellite environment. This document raises issues for each of these protocols.</t>
