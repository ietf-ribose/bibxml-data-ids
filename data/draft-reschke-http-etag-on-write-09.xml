      <t>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) specifies a state identifier,called "Entity Tag", to be returned in the "ETag" response header.However, the description of this header for write operations such asPUT is incomplete, and has caused confusion among developers andprotocol designers, and potentially interoperability problems.This document explains the problem in detail and suggests both aclarification for a revision to the HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC2616)and a new header for use in responses, making HTTP entity tags moreuseful for user agents that want to avoid round-trips to the serverafter modifying a resource.</t>
