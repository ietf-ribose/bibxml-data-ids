      <t>The Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) specification describes how to process domain names that contain characters outside the ASCII repertoire. A user who has a non-ASCII domain name may want to use it in an Internet mail address that contains non-ASCII characters not only in the domain part but also in the local part (the part to the left of the '@'). This document describes how to use non-ASCII characters in local parts. It defines internationalized local parts (ILPs), internationalized mail addresses (IMAs), and a mechanism called IMAA for handling them in a standard fashion.</t>
