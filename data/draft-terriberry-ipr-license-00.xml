      <t>This draft gives provides an example set of licensing terms for use in IPR disclosures that are compatible with the goals of the proposed video-codec working group for further discussion and refinement by participants at the IETF. Although usage of such a license is strictly voluntary, the hope is that getting agreement on a set of terms before the bulk of the work begins will allow contributors to use a common license and minimize the amount of legal analysis that must be performed in order to deploy the codec.</t>
