      <t>The IESG procedures for conducting conflict reviews of Independent and IRTF Stream Submissions, described in RFC 5742, have proven restrictive in ways that prevent the IESG from adequately expressing its opinions and that can interfere with an open and transparent process. This document updates RFC 5742 to mitigate that problem.</t>
