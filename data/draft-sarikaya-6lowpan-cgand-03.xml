      <t>This document defines lightweight secure neighbor discovery for low- power and lossy networks. The nodes generate a Cryptographically Generated Address, register the Cryptographically Generated Address with a default router and periodically refresh the registration. Modifications to 6lowpan Neighbor Discovery protocol are described for secure neighbor discovery for low-power and lossy networks. Cryptographically generated address and digital signatures are calculated using elliptic curve cryptography, so that the cryptographic operations are suitable for low power devices.</t>
