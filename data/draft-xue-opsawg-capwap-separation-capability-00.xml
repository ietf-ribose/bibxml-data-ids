    <abstract>
      <t>In a centralized IEEE 802.11 Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) architecture, the Access Controller (AC) does not have the intelligence to aggregate all the wireless frames. In addition, increasing amounts of traffic handled by each access point would require even more processing at an AC. Thus it is normal in an existing operator's network for the WTPs to forward the wireless frames directly to AR to avoid overloading the AC. In this scenario, CAPWAP Control Channel and CAPWAP Data Channel are separated from each other. This document provides extensions to CAPWAP for the split scenario where CAPWAP Control and Data Channel are separated.</t>
