      <t>Presence federation refers to the exchange of presence informationbetween systems. One of the primary challenges in presencefederation is scale. With a large number of watchers in one domainobtaining presence for many presentities in another, the amount ofnotification traffic is large. This document describes an extensionto the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event framework, called viewsharing. View sharing can substantially reduce the amount oftraffic, but requires a certain level of trust between domains. Viewsharing allows the amount of presence traffic between domains toachieve the theoretical lower bound on information exchange in anypresence system.</t>
