    <abstract>
      <t>Several recent IETF privacy protocols require clients to acquire bootstrap information for a service in a way that guarantees both authenticity and consistency, e.g., encrypting to the same key as many other users. This specification defines a procedure for transferring arbitrary HTTP resources in a manner that provides these guarantees. The procedure relies on access to a semi-trusted HTTP proxy, under the same security assumptions as an Oblivious HTTP Relay.</t>
