      <t>SDRP packet forwarding and setup have been described in another document, and a prototype implementation completed. However, we are presently relying on manual mechanisms to construct the source routes. This document explores several design options for automating the process of SDRP route construction and thereby making it more dynamic. The proposed approaches make use of IDRP RIB information, and protocol mechanisms.</t>
