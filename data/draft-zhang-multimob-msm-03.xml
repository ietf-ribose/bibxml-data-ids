      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6), specified in RFC 5213 [1], is a network- based mobility management protocol. It uses a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) to allow hosts to move around within a domain while keeping their address or address prefix stable. Although the issues of mobile multicast in the PMIPv6 network are being discussed in the Multimob WG, how to provide the service connectivity when the multicast source is moving is still a problem for the PMIPv6. This document proposes and analyzes the potential solutions of the multicast source mobility in PMIPv6.</t>
