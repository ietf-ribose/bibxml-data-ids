      <t>This memo registers a trace field clause for use in indicating transitions between handling queues or processing states, including enacting inter- and intra-host message transitions. This might include message quarantining, mailing list moderation, timed delivery, queueing for further analysis, content conversion, or other similar causes, as well as optionally identifying normal handling queues.</t>
