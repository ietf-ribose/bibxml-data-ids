      <t>Since the Domain Name System (DNS) [RFC1035] was created there have been a desire to use other characters than ASCII in domain names. Lately this desire have grown very strong and several groups have started to experiment with non-ASCII names. This document defines how the Universal Character Set (UCS) [ISO10646] is to be used in DNS. It includes both a transition scheme for older software supporting non-ASCII handling in applications only, as well as how to use UCS in labels and having more than 63 octets in a label.</t>
