      <t>This document defines the responsibilities and authorities for defining, collecting and distributing RFC 1327 address mapping rules. It clearly defines the items: mapping function, addressing authority, administrative equivalence as well as a mechanism for registering mapping authorities and administrative equivalence. This mechanism is based on an extension of RFC 1327 mapping rules (during the collection distribution process). No changes to already installed gateway software are required.</t>
