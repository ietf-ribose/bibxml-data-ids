      <t>There are many circumstances in LDAP [1] when the result of a Search operation returns attribute values that have the distinguished name (DN) syntax. This document defines controls that allow the client to request that the server tag each DN with its object classes. This is a useful feature because object classes such as groups [3] may hold many DNs, each of which is a potentially different object class. When using this control in a search, the LDAP client request that the server return the object classes of each DN that is an attribute value of the search result. This control also defines a way to limit the kinds of DNs that should be returned in a Search result.</t>
