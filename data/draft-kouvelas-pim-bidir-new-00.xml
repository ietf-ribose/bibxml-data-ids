      <t>This document discusses a new form of Bi-directional PIM, a variantof PIM Sparse Mode [1] that builds bi-directional shared trees con-necting multicast sources and receivers.The ideas presented in this document are similar to those describedin [2]. The main difference between the two proposals is in themethod used to forward packets traveling upstream from a source tothe RP. In particular [2] uses an IP option (UMP option) on datapackets to assist with upstream forwarding. The UMP option identifiesthe next hop router responsible for forwarding the packet upstream.In contrast, this proposal does not alter data packets to embed con-trol information. Instead the identification of the next hop upstreamforwarder is performed at RP discovery time using a fail-safe elec-tion mechanism. This significantly simplifies forwarding proceduresand eliminates forwarding loops and packet duplication problems thatexist in [2].</t>
