    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a mechanism that can be used to increase the speed at which link state information is flooded across a network when multiple LSPDUs need to be flooded, such as in case of a node failure. It also reduces the likelihood of overloading the downstream flooding neighbors. This document defines a new TLV to be advertised in IS-IS Hello messages. This TLV carries two parameters indicating the performance capacity to receive LSPDUs: the minimum delay between two consecutive LSPDUs and the number of LSPDUs which can the received back to back.</t>
