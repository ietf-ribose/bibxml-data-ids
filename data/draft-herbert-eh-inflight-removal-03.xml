    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies an experimental method to allow routers to remove IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Options or Routing headers from packets in- flight. The goal is to reduce the probability of packets being dropped, because they contain extension headers, without adversely impacting functionality. An additional goal is to limit visibility of information in extension headers to those nodes that need to process the headers.</t>
