      <t>This document describes the operation of the audio streaming service provided for the IETF from IETF 62 up to the most recent (IETF 72) meeting. Efforts associated with meetings prior to IETF 62 back to IETF 49 as well as a proposal for the current effort were detailed in the now expired draft draft-jaeggli-ietftv-ng-01.txt. The purpose of this document is to inform future efforts to deliver streaming media services for remote or local participants of the level of service and the technology that was employed.</t>
