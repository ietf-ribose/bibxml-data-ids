      <t>Access Service Network is a Network Access Provider's network. In Access Service Network, subscribers can connect to various ISPs/VPNs by specifying appropriate authentication information. This draft describes a signaling protocol based on PWE3 control protocol [PWE3- SIG] for Access Service Network which uses IEEE 802.1x as a user authentication protocol. The protocol sets up a special kind of VPLS which does not forward broadcast/multicast Ethernet frames between subscribers for better security.</t>
