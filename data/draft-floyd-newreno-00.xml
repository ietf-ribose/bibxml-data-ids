      <t>RFC 2581 [RFC2581] documents the following four intertwined TCPcongestion control algorithms: Slow Start, Congestion Avoidance, FastRetransmit, and Fast Recovery. RFC 2581 [RFC2581] explicitly allowscertain modifications of these algorithms, including modificationsthat use the TCP Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) option [RFC2018],and modifications that respond to 'partial acknowledgments' (ACKswhich cover new data, but not all the data outstanding when loss wasdetected) in the absence of SACK. The NewReno mechanism described inthis document describes a specific algorithm for responding topartial acknowledgments, referred to as NewReno. This response topartial acknowledgments was first proposed by Janey Hoe in [Hoe95].</t>
