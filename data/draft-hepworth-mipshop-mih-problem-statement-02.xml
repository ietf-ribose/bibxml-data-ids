      <t>There are on-going activities in the networking community to developsolutions that aid in IP handover mechanisms between heterogeneouswired and wireless access systems including, but not limited to, IEEE802.21. Intelligent access selection, taking into account link layerattributes, requires the delivery of a variety of differentinformation types to the terminal from different sources within thenetwork and vice-versa. The protocol requirements for thissignalling have both transport and security issues that must beconsidered. The signalling must not be constrained to specific linktypes, so there is at least a common component to the signallingproblem which is within the scope of the IETF. This draft presents aproblem statement for this core problem.</t>
