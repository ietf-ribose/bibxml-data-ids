      <t>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) currently supports groupingmedia lines. SDP also has semantics defined for grouping theassociated source and Forward Error Correction (FEC)-based repairflows. However, the existing specifications have strict requirementsthat severely limit the use of the new features that are currentlyunder development in the FECFRAME WG. These new features will allowapplications to use FEC in a more flexible way but they requirechanges in the current specifications. This document provides a listof the required changes and discusses potential approaches to makethese changes.</t>
