      <t>This document presents a new group key distribution protocol. The new protocol is similar to IKEv2 in message and payload formats as well as message semantics. The protocol is in conformance with MSEC key management architecture that it contains two components: member registration and group rekeying, both downloading group security associations from the Group Controller Key Server to a member of the group.</t>
