      <t>This document describes the "Bump-In-the-Host" (BIH), a host basedprotocol translation mechanism that allows a subset of applicationssupporting only one IP address family to communicate with peers thatare reachable or supporting only the other address family.This specification addresses scenarios where a host is provided dualstack or IPv6 only network connectivity. In the dual stack networkcase, single address family applications in the host sometime willcommunicate directly with other hosts using the different addressfamily. In the case of IPv6 only network or IPv6 only destination,IPv4 originated communications have to be translated into IPv6. TheBIH makes the IPv4 applications think they talk to IPv4 peers andhence hides the IPv6 from those applications.Acknowledgement of previous workThis document is an update to and directly derivative from KazuakiTSHUCHIYA, Hidemitsu HIGUCHI, and Yoshifumi ATARASHI [RFC2767] andfrom Seungyun Lee, Myung-Ki Shin, Yong-Jin Kim, Alain Durand, andErik Nordmark's [RFC3338], which similarly provides a dual stack hostmeans to communicate with other IPv6 host using existing IPv4appliations. This document combines and updates both [RFC2767] and[RFC3338].The changes in this document reflect five components1. Supporting IPv6 only network connections2. IPv4 address pool use private address instead of theunassigned IPv4 addresses (0.0.0.1 - 0.0.0.255)3. Extending ENR and address mapper to operate differently4. Adding an alternative way to implement the ENR5. Going for standards track instead of experimental/informational</t>
