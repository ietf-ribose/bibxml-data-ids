    <abstract>
      <t>Source address validation (SAV) table consists of SAV rules that are manually configured or automatically generated. The table will take effect in data plane for checking the validity of source addresses. SAV mechanisms may enable SAV tables in data plane using different methods (e.g., ACL or FIB), and these tables are suitable for different application scenarios. This document aims to provide a systematic view of existing SAV tables, which makes it convenient for engineers or operators to improve existing SAV mechanisms or properly apply SAV on routers. The document first examines existing forms of SAV tables and provides a unified abstraction. Then, three validation modes are concluded as well as suggestions for application scenarios. Finally, diversified actions for each validity state are introduced for compliance of different operation requirements.</t>
