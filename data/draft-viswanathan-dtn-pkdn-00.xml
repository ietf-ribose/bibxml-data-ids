      <t>Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) introduces a network model in which communications can be subject to long delays and/or intermittent connectivity. DTN specifies the use of public-key cryptography to secure the confidentiality and integrity of messages in transit. The use of public-key cryptography posits the need for certification of public keys and revocation of certificates. This document formally defines the DTN key management problem and then provides a high-level design solution for delay and disruption tolerant distribution and revocation of public-key certificates along with relevant design options and recommendations for design choices.</t>
