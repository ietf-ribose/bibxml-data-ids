    <abstract>
      <t>Since the publication of [RFC5050] a number of transport and convergence layer protocols have been developed to carry bundles between nodes in a delay-tolerant network. Before the publication of Bundle Protocol version 7 (BPv7) in [RFC9171], there was only one standardized version of the Bundle Protocol, version 6, and as many of these transport and convergence-layer protocols pre-date the publication of version 7, they do not include any protocol mechanism to differentiate between versions of the Bundle Protocol. This document updates [RFC9171] by defining a CBOR [RFC8949] tag that should be used as an explicit indicator that a particular CBOR array is a Bundle Protocol version 7 bundle. It also describes a mechanism by which an implementation can determine the version of the Bundle Protocol that was used to encode a bundle by examining the initial octets of the encoded data.</t>
