      <t>This Internet Draft describes an existing protocol for transporting IP packets over AppleTalk networks. It is intended to specify, standardize, and enhance existing implementations. There is much confusion over what MacIP really is, as it has grown by many small increments designed and implemented by at least as many people. There has been no central or formal design document, so each of the protocol additions and their effects are not well understood. We hope to dissect the anatomy of the current state of the art, and recommend a functional subset of the protocol features and a new gateway architecture that will help provide services to multiple zones more reliably. The MacIP protocol is used to transport IP packets across AppleTalk networks. There are many existing host and gateway implementations of this protocol, and most of them have many slight differences.</t>
