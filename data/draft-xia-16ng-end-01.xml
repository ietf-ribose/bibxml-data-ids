      <t>This draft describes a possible optimization to Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) which can be used to successfully terminate DAD early. The method is based on a positive RA message sent by an Neighbor Discovery Relay Agent that knows all the IPv6 addresses of the nodes currently attached to it.</t>
