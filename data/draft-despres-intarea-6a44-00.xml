      <t>In customer sites having IPv4-only CPEs, Teredo provides a lastresort IPv6 connectivity [RFC4380] [RFC5991] [RFC6081]. However,because it is designed to work without involvement of Internetservice providers, it has significant limitations (connectivitybetween IPv6 native addresses and Teredo addresses is uncertain;connectivity between Teredo addresses fails for some combinations ofNAT types). 6a44 is a complementary solution that, being base on ISPcooperation, avoids these limitations. At the beginning of IPv6addresses, it replaces the Teredo well-known prefix by networkspecific prefixes assigned by local ISP's (an evolution similar tothat from 6to4 to 6rd). In hosts, 6a44 can be implemented eitherautonomously or as an extension of Teredo. Except for IANA numbersthat remain to be confirmed, the specification is intended to becomplete enough for running codes to be independently written and thesolution to be incrementally deployed.</t>
