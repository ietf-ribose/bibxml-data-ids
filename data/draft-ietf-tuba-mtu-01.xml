      <t>This memo describes a technique for dynamically discovering the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of an arbitrary CLNP path. The mechanism described here is applicable to both 'pure-stack' OSI as well as TUBA/CLNP environments, i.e., environments where Internet transport protocols (UDP and TCP) are operated over CLNP. This technique might not in all cases discover the optimum Path MTU, but it will always choose a Path MTU as accurate as, and in many cases more accurate than, the Path MTU that would be chosen by current practice.</t>
