      <t>This document defines the PCRP (Ping, Challenge, Resolve, Product) Specification for Webhook events in a standardized way. It is specifically designed to address the challenges faced in current webhook event implementations, which lack consistency and a defined flow. PCRP introduces a new header X-PCRP-Type to indicate the step of the process, and its values include ping, challenge, resolve, and product.</t>
