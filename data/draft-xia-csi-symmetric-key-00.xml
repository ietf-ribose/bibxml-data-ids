      <t>In this document, a method for provisioning a shared key from therouter to the host is defined to protect Neighbor Discovery(ND)signaling between the router and the host. The host sends a RouterSolicitation(RS) message with ND Shared Key Request Option to therouter. The router encrypts a ND shared key using the host's SEcureNeighbor Discovery(SEND) public key and sends it back to the hostthrough a Router Advertisement(RA) message. The host decrypts the NDshared key using the matching private key. The Neighbor Discoveryshared key is then used for protecting the following NeighborDiscovery signaling between the router and the host. The RouterSolicitation and Router Advertisement message exchanges are requiredto have SEND security.</t>
