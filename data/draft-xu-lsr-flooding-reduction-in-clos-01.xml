    <abstract>
      <t>In a CLOS topology, an OSPF (or ISIS) router may receive identical copies of an LSA (or LSP) from multiple OSPF (or ISIS) neighbors. Moreover, two OSPF (or ISIS) neighbors may exchange the same LSA (or LSP) simultaneously. This results in unnecessary flooding of link- state information, which wastes the precious resources of OSPF (or ISIS) routers. Therefore, this document proposes extensions to OSPF (or ISIS) to reduce this flooding within CLOS networks. The reduction of OSPF (or ISIS) flooding is highly beneficial for improving the scalability of CLOS networks.</t>
