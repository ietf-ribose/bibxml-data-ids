    <abstract>
      <t>In a transport network scenario, where Data Plane connections controlled either by GMPLS (Soft Permanent Connections - SPC) or by Management System (Permanent Connections - PC) may independently coexist, the ability of transforming an existing PC into a SPC and vice versa - without actually affecting Data Plane traffic being carried over it - is a valuable option. This applies especially when a GMPLS based Control Plane is first introduced into an existing network and there may be the need, from a Carrier point of view, to pass under GMPLS control existing connections already set up over Data Plane. In other terms, such operation could be seen as a way of transferring the ownership and control of an existing and in-use Data Plane connection between the Management Plane and the Control Plane, leaving its Data Plane state untouched. This memo provides a minor extension to GRSVP-TE signaling protocol, within GMPLS architecture, to enable such connection ownership transfer and describes the proposed procedures.
