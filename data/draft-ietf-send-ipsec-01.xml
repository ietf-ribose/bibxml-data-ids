      <t>IPv6 nodes use the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol to discover other nodes on the link, to determine each other's link-layer addresses, to find routers and to maintain reachability information about the paths to active neighbors. If not secured, ND protocol is vulnerable to various attacks. This document specifies an extension to IPsec for securing ND. Contrary to the original ND specifications that also called for use of IPsec, this extension does not require the creation of a large number of manually configured security associations.</t>
