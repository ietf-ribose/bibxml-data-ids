      <t>IPv6 nodes use the Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol to discover othernodes on the link, to determine each other's link-layer addresses, tofind routers and to maintain reachability information about the pathsto active neighbors. If not secured, ND protocol is vulnerable tovarious attacks. This document specifies an extension to IPsec forsecuring ND. Contrary to the original ND specifications that alsocalled for use of IPsec, this extension does not require the creationof a large number of manually configured security associations.</t>
