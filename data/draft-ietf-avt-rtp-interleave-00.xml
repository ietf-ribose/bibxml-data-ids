      <t>This document describes a payload format for use with the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) version 2 for interleaving encoded audio data. It is intended for use in audio streaming delay tolerant applications operating over best-effort packet networks. The goal of interleaving is to disperse burst losses into a series of shorter losses. The total amount of audio lost is not changed by interleaving, but the individual loss events are shorter and easier to conceal at the receiver.</t>
