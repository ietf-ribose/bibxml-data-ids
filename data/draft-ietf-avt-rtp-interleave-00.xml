      <t>This document describes a payload format for use with theReal-time Transport Protocol (RTP) version 2 for interleavingencoded audio data. It is intended for use in audio streamingdelay tolerant applications operating over best-effort packetnetworks. The goal of interleaving is to disperse burstlosses into a series of shorter losses. The total amount ofaudio lost is not changed by interleaving, but the individualloss events are shorter and easier to conceal at the receiver.</t>
