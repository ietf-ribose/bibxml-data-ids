      <t>This document presents seven YANG 1.1 modules. Three IETF modules, and four supporting IANA modules. The three IETF modules are: ietf-ssh-common, ietf-ssh-client, and ietf-ssh-server. The "ietf-ssh-client" and "ietf-ssh-server" modules are the primary productions of this work, supporting the configuration and monitoring of SSH clients and servers. The four IANA modules are: iana-ssh-encryption-algs, iana-ssh-key- exchange-algs, iana-ssh-mac-algs, and iana-ssh-public-key-algs. These modules each define YANG enumerations providing support for an IANA-maintained algorithm registry. Editorial Note (To be removed by RFC Editor) This draft contains placeholder values that need to be replaced with finalized values at the time of publication. This note summarizes all of the substitutions that are needed. No other RFC Editor instructions are specified elsewhere in this document. Artwork in this document contains shorthand references to drafts in progress. Please apply the following replacements: * AAAA --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-crypto- types * BBBB --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-trust- anchors * CCCC --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-keystore * DDDD --&gt; the assigned RFC value for draft-ietf-netconf-tcp-client- server * EEEE --&gt; the assigned RFC value for this draft Artwork in this document contains placeholder values for the date of publication of this draft. Please apply the following replacement: * 2024-03-16 --&gt; the publication date of this draft The "Relation to other RFCs" section Section 1.2 contains the text "one or more YANG modules" and, later, "modules". This text is sourced from a file in a context where it is unknown how many modules a draft defines. The text is not wrong as is, but it may be improved by stating more directly how many modules are defined. The "Relation to other RFCs" section Section 1.2 contains a self- reference to this draft, along with a corresponding reference in the Appendix. Please replace the self-reference in this section with "This RFC" (or similar) and remove the self-reference in the "Normative/Informative References" section, whichever it is in. Tree-diagrams in this draft may use the '\' line-folding mode defined in RFC 8792. However, nicer-to-the-eye is when the '\\' line-folding mode is used. The AD suggested suggested putting a request here for the RFC Editor to help convert "ugly" '\' folded examples to use the '\\' folding mode. "Help convert" may be interpreted as, identify what looks ugly and ask the authors to make the adjustment. The following Appendix sections are to be removed prior to publication: * Appendix A.1. Initial Module for the "Encryption Algorithm Names" Registry * Appendix A.2. Initial Module for the "MAC Algorithm Names" Registry * Appendix A.3. Initial Module for the "Public Key Algorithm Names" Registry * Appendix A.4. Initial Module for the "Key Exchange Method Names" Registry * Appendix B. Change Log</t>
