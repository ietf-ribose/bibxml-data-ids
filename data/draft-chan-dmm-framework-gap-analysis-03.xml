    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes a unified framework of mobility management in terms of abstracted logical functions. It is shown that mip, pmip, and several of their extensions can be expressed in terms of different configurations of these logical functions. Such a unified framework provides a convenient view on gap analysis of existing protocols, and also on the needed re-configurations of the logical functions as well as the needed extensions towards distributed mobility management.</t>
