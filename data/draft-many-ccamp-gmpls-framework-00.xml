      <t>This document presents a framework for the GMPLS control plane. It studies the GMPLS control plane from three different perspectives: functional partitioning, computational layering and network partitioning. First, it studies the functional building blocks of a generic GMPLS control plane and illustrates that, in order to be generalized for different technologies and their specific application environment, what each functional component could assume, what it 'should' (instead of 'how') accomplish, what are the generic procedures and possible options.</t>
