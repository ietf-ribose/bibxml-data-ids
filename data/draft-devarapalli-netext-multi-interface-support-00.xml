      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 enables network-based mobility for a regular IPv6mobile node with no mobility management protocol. It makes it appearto the mobile node that its IP address does not change as the mobilenode moves across the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain. There have been someissues identified with supporting a host with multiple interfacesattaching to the Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain. This document describesand analyzes some of the scenarios associated with this. It alsodescribes the requirements for a handover across interfaces usingProxy Mobile IPv6.</t>
