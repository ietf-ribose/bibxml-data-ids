      <t>This document describes a new key-wrapping algorithm to be used in the EnvelopedData, AuthenticatedData and AuthEnvelopedData structures of the Cryptographic Message Syntax. Because these structures do not provide data-origin authentication, a recipient cannot cryptographically verify that the plaintext received was the plaintext encapsulated by the message's original sender. The With- MAC key-wrapping algorithm allows an EncryptedKey value to hold both a wrapped symmetric key and a MAC value on the data to be authenticated. When used in EnvelopedData, AuthenticatedData and AuthEnvelopedData structures, therefore, these structures can achieve data-origin authentication (in some circumstances) using only symmetric-key algorithms. This is useful in cases where the structures must be generated by entities without certified digital- signature keys.</t>
