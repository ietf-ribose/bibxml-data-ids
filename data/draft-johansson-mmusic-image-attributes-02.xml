      <t>This document proposes a new generic session setup attribute to makeit possible to negotiate different image attributes such as imagesize. A possible use case is to make it possible for a e.g a low-endhand-held terminal to display video without the need to rescale theimage, something that may consume large amounts of memory andprocessing power. The draft also helps to maintain an optimalbitrate for video as only the image size that is desired by thereceiver is transmitted.Requirements LanguageThe key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</t>
