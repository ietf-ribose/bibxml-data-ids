    <abstract>
      <t>This document reports findings in the availability and operational performance of the client side translator (CLAT) feature within 464XLAT as defined in [RFC6877]. It also identifies remaining issues in providing ubiquitous and efficient CLAT support on a global scale. Since publication in April 2013, 464XLAT has made a significant impact on mobile networks wishing to implement endpoints purely with IPv6. This has allowed the IPv6 Internet to expand dramatically as well as increase IPv6 deployments across wireline and enterprise- style networks.</t>
