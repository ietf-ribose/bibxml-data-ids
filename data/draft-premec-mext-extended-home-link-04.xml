      <t>Mobile IPv6 for Dual Stack Hosts and Routers enables mobility for themobile node's IPv6 home address or prefix as well as an IPv4 homeaddress, irrespective of the IP version supported on the link thatthe mobile node is attached to. The home agent maintains bindingcache entries for the IPv6 and IPv4 home addresses assigned to themobile node when the mobile node is connected via a foreign link.The binding cache entries are deprecated when the mobile nodeattaches to its home link. This document addresses an issue relatedto the de-registration procedure and the continued connectivity forthe IPv4 home address when the mobile node attaches to its IPv6-onlyhome link.</t>
