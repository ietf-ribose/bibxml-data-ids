    <abstract>
      <t>Computation Aware Traffic Steering (CATS) is a traffic engineering architecture that takes the dynamic changes of computing and network resources into account when forwarding traffic to appropriate service instances for processing. For the development of the current network, it is important to have a solution that meets different types of service requirements and can be deployed reasonably Therefore, this document proposes a hybrid solution to provide differentiated and flexible traffic streering capabilities for different service while saving the cost of retrofitting existing network equipment.</t>
