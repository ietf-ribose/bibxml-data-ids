      <t>This document defines a means for a Label-Switching Router (LSR) to verify that its data plane is functioning for certain key Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) applications, including unicast forwarding and traffic engineering tunnels. A new Loopback FEC type is defined to allow an upstream neighbor to assist in the testing at very low cost. MPLS Verification Request and MPLS Verification Reply messages are defined to do the actual probing.</t>
