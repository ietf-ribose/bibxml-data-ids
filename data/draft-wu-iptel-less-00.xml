      <t>In Internet telephony, end systems can take a large role in providingservices, especially in networks without pre-configuredinfra-structure, such as peer-to-peer networks. Since we believethat end system services differ in their requirements from networkservices, we define a new service creation scripting language calledthe Language for End System Services (LESS). LESS inherits mancharacteristics from the Call Processing Language (CPL). It containscommands and events for direct user interaction and the control ofmedia applications. This document defines the basic elements of LESSand several commonly used LESS extensions.</t>
