      <t>This document is a product of the work of the MIF Architecture Design team. It outlines a solution framework for some of the issues experienced by nodes that can be attached to multiple networks simultaneously. The framework defines the concept of a Provisioning Domain (PvD) which is a a consistent set of network configuration information. PvD aware nodes learn PvD specific information from the networks they are attached to and / or other sources. PvDs are used to enable separation and configuration consistency in presence of multiple concurrent connections.</t>
