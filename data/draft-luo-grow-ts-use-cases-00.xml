      <t>Transporting data to their users through operators' networks is a fundamental service that can benefit both providers and consumers. Due to the dramatically increased popularity and desire of differentiated services and their constraints, it is essential for operators to provide the traffic steering service under limited network resources and maximize their benefits at the same time. This document lists some typical use cases for traffic steering services. This document does not attempt to enumerate all kinds of scenarios, but rather it describes several key features of these scenarios from which solutions may be constructed.</t>
