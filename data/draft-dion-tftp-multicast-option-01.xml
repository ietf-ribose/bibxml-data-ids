      <t>The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, filetransfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto aremote host.This document describes a new TFTP option. This new option will allowthe multiple clients to receive the same file concurrently throughthe use of Multicast packets. The TFTP Option Extension mechanism isdescribed in [2].Often when similar computers are booting remotely they will eachdownload the same image file. By adding multicast into the TFTPoption set, two or more computers can download a fileconcurrently, thus increasing network efficiency.This document assumes that the reader is familiar with theterminology and notation of both [1] and [2].</t>
