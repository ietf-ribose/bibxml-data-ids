      <t>When transport protocols are deployed over a path including a wireless sub-network, a wireless access device now has significantly better knowledge of the wireless portion of the connection path characteristics than one or both endpoints. End-to-end mechanisms continue to work (see [PILC] and related specifications), but must rely on communication over a sub- network link that experiences outages and degradation. This document will set the framework for investigation of whether this special knowledge from wireless access devices can be useful to endpoint transports. While the initial focus is on wireless links, other links will also be taken into account.</t>
