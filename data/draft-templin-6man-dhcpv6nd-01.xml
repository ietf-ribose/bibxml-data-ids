    <abstract>
      <t>On some IPv6 links, clients may have a reasonable expectation that routers on the link would be willing to support DHCPv6 address/prefix delegation services without the need to first examine the M/O bits in a received Router Advertisement (RA) message. Such clients should therefore be capable of invoking the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6ND) router discovery and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) address/prefix delegation services in a single message exchange instead of multiple. This document specifies a new IPv6ND option termed the "DHCPv6ND Option" that supports both functions in a single message exchange.</t>
