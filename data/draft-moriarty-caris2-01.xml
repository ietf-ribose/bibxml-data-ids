      <t>The *Coordinating Attack Response at Internet Scale (CARIS) 2* workshop workshop [CARISEvent], sponsored by the Internet Society, took place 28 February and 1 March 2019 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Participants spanned regional, national, international, and enterprise CSIRTs, operators, service providers, network and security operators, transport operators and researchers, incident response researchers, vendors, and participants from standards communities. This workshop continued the work started at the first CARIS workshop, with a focus for CARIS 2 on scaling incident prevention and detection as the Internet industry moves to stronger and a more ubiquitous deployment of session encryption.</t>
