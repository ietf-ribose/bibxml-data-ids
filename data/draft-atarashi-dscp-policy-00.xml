      <t>In reviewing the specific use of the Differentiated Services Architecture for supporting the Internet Emergency Preparedness System, we found what we believe is a general issue. This is that even though a client or peer can connect to a server or peer with a predictable DSCP value, the response does not have a predictable DSCP value. We consider the issues, and recommend an approach to application policy regarding the DSCP.</t>
