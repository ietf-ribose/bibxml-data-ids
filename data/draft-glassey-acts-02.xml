      <t>The Automated Computer Time Service [ACTS] has been provided since 1988 for public users who need to synchronize computer clocks to the correct time to a Federally Provided timesource for security, audit, or just general synchronization purposes. In the current evolving EC aware landscape, the source of time used in best computing practices is more and more important to the overall dependability of the trust model. This document then, is filed for historical purposes on the already widely used, publicly available ACTS time service protocol. [AWTT]</t>
