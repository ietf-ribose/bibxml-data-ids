      <t>The purpose of this document is to contribute to the development of Dynamic Home Agent Discovery in draft-ietf-mobileip-ip6-07.txt[1]. Dynamic Home Agent Discovery refers to a mobile node's ability to choose their own home agents while in a foreign net for Mobile IPv6. We have identified some shortcomings and ambiguities in the current draft specification during the implementation of Dynamic Home Agent Discovery. We are proposing enhancements and extensions that would benefit the protocol.</t>
