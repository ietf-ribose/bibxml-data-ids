      <t>To limit the privacy issues created by the association between a device, its traffic, its location, and its user, client and client Operating System vendors have started implementing MAC address randomization. When such randomization happens, some in-network states may break, which may affect network connectivity and user experience. At the same time, devices may continue using other stable identifiers, defeating the MAC address randomization purposes. This document lists various network environment and a range of network services that may be affected by such randomization. This document then examines settings where the user experience may be affected by in-network state disruption. Last, this document examines schemas to maintain user privacy while preserving user quality of experience and network operation efficiency.</t>
