    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Private Set Intersection (ECDH-PSI) for 2 participants. It instantiates the classical Meadows match-making protocol with standard elliptic curves and hash-to-curve methods, enabling the participants to find common records in a privacy-respecting way. In ECDH-PSI, records are encoded to points on an elliptic curve, and masked by the private keys of both participants. To compute the intersection, a participant only uses the jointly masked datasets and its original dataset locally, which prevents its partner from learning the private records not in the intersection.</t>
