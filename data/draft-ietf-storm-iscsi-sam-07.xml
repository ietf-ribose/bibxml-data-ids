    <abstract>
      <t>Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) is a SCSI transport protocol that maps the SCSI family of protocols onto TCP/IP. The iSCSI protocol as specified in [draft-ietf-storm- iscsi-cons-xx] (and as previously specified by the combination of RFC 3720 and RFC 5048) is based on the SAM-2 (SCSI Architecture Model - 2) version of the SCSI family of protocols. This document defines enhancements to the iSCSI protocol to support certain additional features of the SCSI protocol that were defined in SAM-3, SAM-4, and SAM-5. This document is a companion document to [draft-ietf-storm- iscsi-cons-xx]. -------------------------------------------------------- RFC EDITORS NOTE: The above references to [draft-ietf-storm- iscsi-cons-xx] should reference the RFC number assigned to that document, and this note should be removed. --------------------------------------------------------</t>
