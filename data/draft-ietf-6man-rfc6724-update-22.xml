    <abstract>
      <t>This document updates the default address selection algorithm for Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), originally specified in RFC 6724, based on accumulated operational experience. It introduces the concept of "known-local" Unique Local Address (ULA) prefixes within the fd00::/8 block and specifies that ULA-to-ULA communications using such prefixes should be preferred over both IPv4-to-IPv4 and GUA-to- GUA (Global Unicast Address) communications in local use scenarios. The document defines mechanisms for nodes to identify and incorporate known-local prefixes into their address selection policy tables. It further clarifies the unconditional requirement for implementing Rule 5.5 of RFC 6724 and reduces the default precedence for 6to4 addresses. These updates enhance the supportability of typical deployment environments, including automatic and unmanaged configurations, and promote consistent IPv6-over-IPv4 precedence behavior for both ULA and GUA within local networks. The document acknowledges that certain atypical deployment models may require explicit configuration to achieve intended operational outcomes.</t>
