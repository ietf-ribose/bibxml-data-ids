    <abstract>
      <t>NIST recently standardized ML-KEM, a new key encapsulation mechanism, which can be used for quantum-resistant key establishment. This draft specifies how to use ML-KEM as an additional key exchange in IKEv2 along with traditional key exchanges. This Post-Quantum Traditional Hybrid Key Encapsulation Mechanism approach allows for negotiating IKE and Child SA keys which are safe against cryptanalytically-relevant quantum computers and theoretical weaknesses in ML-KEM.</t>
