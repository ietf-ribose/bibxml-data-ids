      <t>As technologies for bidirectional communication over HTTP have becomepervasive, interest has grown in (1) defining improved mechanisms forsupport of existing technologies (short-term solutions such as newHTTP headers) and (2) the development of new bidirectional protocols(long-term solutions such as WebSocket, Bidirectional Web TransferProtocol, and Reverse HTTP). In order to provide context for suchwork, this document provides a tentative map of the design space forbidirectional HTTP, with special attention to deployed infrastructure(e.g. web clients, intermediaries, firewalls, NATs, web servers) andprogramming environments.</t>
