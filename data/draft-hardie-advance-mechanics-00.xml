      <t>The IETF has maintained a three-stage standards track for some time,with basic mechanics set out in RFC 2026 [RFC2026]. The mechanics asdescribed, however, are not currently used in practice andadvancement along the standards track is both unusual and moredifficult than many IETF participants find reasonable. This documentproposes an update to those mechanics, in the interest of improvingthe overall functioning of the IETF. It is compatible with, but doesnot require, a move to a two-stage standards track.</t>
