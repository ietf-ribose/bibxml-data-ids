      <t>The [RFC2581] provides a mechanism to indicate the congestion information of the network to the source. In this draft, time shifting of the signal before usage is suggested. The time shifting operation effectively counters the impact of the self similarity of the traffic that originates in a DiffServe network model as a result of the aggregation.</t>
