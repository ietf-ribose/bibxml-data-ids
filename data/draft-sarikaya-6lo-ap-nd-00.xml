      <t>This document defines an extension of 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery for application in low-power and lossy networks. The protocol is specified to be protected and to support multi-hop operation. A node computes its Cryptographic, Unique Interface ID, and associates one or more of its Registered Addresses with that Cryptographic ID in place of the EUI-64 that is used in RFC 6775 to uniquely identify the interface of the Registered Address. Once an address is registered with a Cryptographic ID, only the owner of that ID can modify the state in the 6LR and 6LBR regarding the Registered Address.</t>
