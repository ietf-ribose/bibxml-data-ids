      <t>This document provides a framework and information model for the definition of northbound interfaces for a security policy controller. The interfaces are based on user-intent instead of vendor-specific or device-centric approaches that would require deep knowledge of vendor products and their security features. The document identifies the common interfaces needed to enforce the user-intent-based policies onto network security functions (NSFs) irrespective of how those functions are realized. The function may be physical or virtual in nature and may be implemented in networking or dedicated appliances.</t>
