      <t>The verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) is a cryptographically verifiable extension of the LEI standard, designed to automate trust in organizational identity. Governed by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), the vLEI system uses Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDCs), Self-Addressing Identifiers (SAIDs), and Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) to issue and verify credentials for legal entities and their authorized representatives. It enables secure, machine-readable identity assertions across financial, regulatory, and supply chain ecosystems, supporting role-based delegation and interoperability with decentralized trust frameworks. This specification defines vLEI for verifiable gateway operator identities and cryptographically links the gateway operator identity to the gateway identity. Thus SATP core lock assertions are cryptographically linked to gateway operator identities.</t>
