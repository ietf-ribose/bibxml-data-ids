      <t>Load balancing is a key factor for both IPv4 to IPv6 transitionmechnisms, e.g.NAT-PT or Tunnel broker, and Multihoming to improvetheir scalability and Robustness. In fact, that is a method, bywhich IP packet can be distributed across a pool of servers, insteadof directing to a single server.Load balancing has been widely usedby NAT, Web service and FTP service. However, current load balancingsoftware and implementations have problems such as poor scalability,inability to balance session flow, long latency time and topologicalconstraint on server pool.This document describes a method using pseudo-anycast and pseudo-mobility based on Mobile IPv6 to implement load balancing in sessionlevel in IPv6 network, by which those problems above can be solved.Futhermore, this method only need little modification to Mobile IPv6in the servers' and agent's side; as for the general users, it neednot any modification.</t>
