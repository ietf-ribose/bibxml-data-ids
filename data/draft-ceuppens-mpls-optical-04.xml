    <abstract>
      <t>Realizing the important role that photonic switches can play in data-centric networks, work has been going on within the IETF to combine the control plane of MPLS (more specifically traffic engineering) with the point-and-click provisioning capabilities of photonic switches [1]. This document outlines a proposal to expand this initiative to include DWDM, OADM and ATM systems. It also proposes to expand the work beyond simple establishment of optical paths and include optical performance monitoring and management. The combined path routing and performance information that will be carried and shared between these network elements will allow the elements or element management system (EMS) to adequately assess the 'health' of an optical path (which can be a wavelength or fiber strand). The routers and/or ATM switches at the edges of the photonic network will then use this information to dynamically manage the millions of wavelengths available in the photonic layer.</t>
