    <abstract>
      <t>IEEE Std 802.1AB, known as the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP), can be applied to LSVR neighbor discovery and configuration. This can be achieved by using a nearest router group address as the LLDP Scope MAC Address to target LSVR interfaces while advertising a set of LSVR-specific LLDP TLVs. These LSVR-specific TLVs are defined using LLDP Organizationally Specific TLVs, as specified by LLDP for use by individual organizations to allow them to define their own Type-Length-Value (TLV) objects for exchange over the LLDP protocol. The IETF Organizationally Specific TLVs for LSVR can be encoded using the IETF IANA OUI (RFC 7042). This document provides an overview of applying LLDP to LSVR neighbor discovery and configuration and specifies the IETF Organizationally Specific TLVs that support link discovery for LSVR routers. In addition, a brief discussion of the use of IEEE Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) as specified in IEEE Std 802.1Q-2022 cl 18-22 for link liveliness is included.</t>
