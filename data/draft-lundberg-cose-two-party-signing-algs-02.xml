    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines COSE algorithm identifiers used when one signing operation is split between two cooperating parties. When performing split signing, the first party typically hashes the data to be signed and the second party signs the hashed data computed by the first party. This can be useful when communication with the party holding the signing private key occurs over a limited-bandwidth channel, such as NFC or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), in which it is infeasible to send the complete set of data to be signed. The resulting signatures are identical in structure to those computed by a single party, and can be verified using the same verification algorithm without additional steps to preprocess the signed data.</t>
