    <abstract>
      <t>This Internet Draft introduces an extension to the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) for top-level domain (TLD) registries, enabling registrars to submit pre-registration information for domain names. The extension facilitates quality verification by the registry, employing advanced Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) techniques. Pre-registrations are assigned a quality score based on the analysis of the submitted data, ranging from 0 for non-abusive registrations to 100 for potentially abusive ones. This extension addresses the critical need to proactively identify and mitigate abusive domain registrations within TLDs, contributing to a safer and more reliable internet environment. The document outlines the EPP command definitions, XML schemas, data flow, and security considerations necessary to implement this innovative quality assurance mechanism, thereby enhancing the integrity and trustworthiness of TLD registrations.</t>
