      <t>This Internet Draft specifies a protocol that may be used by End Systems (ESs) and Intermediate Systems (ISs) in order to provide security services in support of TUBA. The TUBA deployment and transition plan relies on a dual-stack (i.e., CLNP and IPv4) approach to evolving the Internet to IPng. Thus, to provide secure operation in an TUBA environment this Internet Draft defines a simple Integrated Network Layer Security Protocol (I-NLSP) that provides confidentiality and integrity services for both CLNP and IPv4. TUBA systems supporting I-NLSP will be capable of secure operations with: (1) other TUBA/I-NLSP systems using either CLNP or IP, and or (2) existing IPv4 operating behind TUBA/I-NLSP capable secure ISs.</t>
