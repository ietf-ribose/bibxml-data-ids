      <t>The DNS is a query / response protocol. Failure to respond to queries causes both immediate operational problems and long term problems with protocol development. This document will identify a number of common classes of queries that some servers fail to respond too. This document will also suggest procedures for TLD and other similar zone operators to apply to reduce / eliminate the problem.</t>
