      <t>In recent years, high-bandwidth LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellite networks, such as Starlink and OneWeb, have seen tremendous development and are gradually becoming an important part of the global Internet. However, due to the unique characteristics of satellite networks, using TCP for data transmission faces challenges in multiple aspects, such as high latency caused by long-distance propagation and high error rates due to signal attenuation. This proposal analyzes the typical characteristics of LEO satellite transmission and their impact on transport layer protocols, and finally summarizes the basic requirements that need to be considered for designing transport layer protocols tailored to LEO satellites.</t>
