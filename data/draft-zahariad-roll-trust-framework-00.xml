      <t>This document presents a trust framework, which may improve thesecurity and reliability of routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks(LLN), against an increased set of attacks. The development of theframework builds upon previous work on trust and secure routing,adapting the trust assessments to the issues and constraints specificto LLNs.The proposed trust management scheme is based on direct and indirectinteractions with neighboring nodes, to compute their trust value andthus select the most trusted path or forwarding node. To reduce theoverhead of nodes' communication during the indirect trust valueretrieval procedure, indirect trust information is requested from alimited number of neighbors, which respond only when they have highlyreliable trust information</t>
