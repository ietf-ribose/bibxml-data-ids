      <t>This document presents a trust framework, which may improve the security and reliability of routing over Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLN), against an increased set of attacks. The development of the framework builds upon previous work on trust and secure routing, adapting the trust assessments to the issues and constraints specific to LLNs. The proposed trust management scheme is based on direct and indirect interactions with neighboring nodes, to compute their trust value and thus select the most trusted path or forwarding node. To reduce the overhead of nodes' communication during the indirect trust value retrieval procedure, indirect trust information is requested from a limited number of neighbors, which respond only when they have highly reliable trust information</t>
