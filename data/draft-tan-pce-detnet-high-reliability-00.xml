      <t>Real-time network performance information, like latency, delay variation, packet loss and in order delivery, is becoming critical in the path computation in some networks. This document propose metric extensions to PCEP messages, to better describe the path computation constraints and QoS requirements of Deterministic Networking (DetNet) flows, especially the high reliability requirements on packet loss and in order delivery. PCEP Extensions defined in this document could be used not only for DetNet, but also for other PCEP scenarios.</t>
