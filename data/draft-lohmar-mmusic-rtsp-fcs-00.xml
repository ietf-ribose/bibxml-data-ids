      <t>RTSP defines the setup and control for on demand and live streamingmedia sessions, which are delivered via an external media transportprotocol such as RTP/UDP. RTSP does not define a mechanism to changethe content during an on-going streaming session. Such a mechanismimproves the streaming experience when a user browses throughmultiple offerings on a single streaming site.This document describes several methods to improve content switching.The basic principle is to re-use already established transportsessions (e.g. RTP/UDP sessions) and negotiate new content to bedelivered on the existing sessions. If additional transport sessionsare necessary, those sessions are established separately. Thisprinciple of re-using the RTSP control and transport sessionsdecreases the content switch delay to a large extent and improves theend-user experience.The present document defines a mechanism for switching to newcontent, both when the client already has the content descriptionavailable and when it does not.This document additionally considers switching of a single mediastream in a session, when several alternative media components areavailable. For instance, the content may provide several alternateaudio tracks in different languages to be played with a single videostream.The principle of Fast Content Switching and Start-up is also definedin 3GPP TS 26.234 [3GPP.26.234] for RTSP 1.0 [RFC2326].</t>
