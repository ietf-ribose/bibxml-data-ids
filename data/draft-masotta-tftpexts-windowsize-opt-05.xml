      <t>The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, file transfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto a remote host. One of its primary uses is the early stages of nodes booting from a Local Area Network. TFTP has been always used because it is very simple to implement. However, the choice of a lock-step schema is not the most efficient for use on a LAN. This document describes a TFTP option which allows the client and server to negotiate a windowsize of consecutive blocks to send as an alternative for replacing the single block lock-step schema. The TFTP Option Extension mechanism is described in [2].</t>
