      <t>The Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network enables multiple tenants to operate in a data center. Each tenant needs to be assigned a priority group to prioritize their traffic. Cloud carriers wish to use quality of service to differentiate different applications. For these purposes, Quality of Service bits are assigned in the Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network outer Ethernet header. How these bits are assigned and are processed in the network are explained in detail. Also the document presents a quality of service framework for overlay networks such as Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network.</t>
