      <t>SRLGs play a key role in routing resiliency and capacity planning of multi-domain and multi-layer networks. Notion of SRLG are used to select a backup path that is disjoint from the primary path, to ensure disjointness of circuits and to avoid catastrophic partitioning outages. In the current specifications, SRLG is identified as a 32 bit number that is unique within an IGP domain [RFC4202]. There are many limitations to this approach of encoding SRLGs, especially in a multi-layer network. This draft outlines these limitations and suggests components of extended SRLG encoding scheme to address them.</t>
