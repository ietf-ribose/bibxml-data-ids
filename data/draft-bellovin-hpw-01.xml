      <t>Many systems (e.g., cryptographic protocols relying on symmetric cryptography) require that plaintext passwords be stored. Given how often people reuse passwords on different systems, this poses a very serious risk if a single machine is compromised. We propose a scheme to derive passwords limited to a single machine from a typed password, and explain how a protocol definition can specify this scheme.</t>
