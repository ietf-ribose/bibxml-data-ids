      <t>There is debate on the topic of "Commit/Rollback of Offer/Answer on Unsuccessful re-INVITE". The reason of the confusion is some application/session usages of offer/answer imply the nest transaction(mean transaction theory, not mean sip transaction) concept, but whitout unambiguous definition. This paper reveal the concept of nest transactions in current RFC and other well known application/session usages. And then clarify that there is no ambiguous state of session modification using current RFC definition.</t>
