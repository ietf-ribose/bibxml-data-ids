    <abstract>
      <t>This document is derived from artificial intelligence (AI) network and autonomous security, network management intend-based technology to ensure constant security quality in B5G. SOAR (Security Orchestration Automation and Response) is needed by autonomous security and network management to optimize an adaptive B5G network. The purpose of this document is to confirm whether the requirements are reflected future users and developed to identify users provided by useful decisions on how to develop the system. This document also covers the user requirements for autonomous security and intend-based network management to ensure constant security quality on B5G.</t>
