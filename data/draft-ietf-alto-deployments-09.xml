      <t>Many Internet applications are used to access resources such as pieces of information or server processes that are available in several equivalent replicas on different hosts. This includes, but is not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications. The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provide guidance to applications that have to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates, which are able to provide a desired resource. This memo discusses deployment related issues of ALTO. It addresses different use cases of ALTO such as peer-to-peer file sharing and CDNs, security considerations, recommendations for network administrators, and also guidance for application designers using ALTO.</t>
