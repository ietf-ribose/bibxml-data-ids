    <abstract>
      <t>Path-Aware Semantic Address (PASA), proposes to algorithmically assign addresses to nodes in a 6lo environment so to achieve stateless forwarding, hence, allowing to avoid using a routing protocol. PASA is more suitable for stable and static wireline connectivity, in order to avoid renumbering due to topology changes. Even in such kind of scenarios, reliability remains a concern. This memo tackles specifically reliability in PASA deployments, analyzing possible broad solution categories to solve the issue.</t>
