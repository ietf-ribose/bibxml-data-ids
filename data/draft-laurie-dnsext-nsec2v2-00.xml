      <t>The DNS Security (DNSSEC) NSEC resource record (RR) is intended to be used to provide authenticated denial of existence of DNS owner names and types; however, it also permits any user to obtain a listing of all DNS owner names in a zone. This can accomplished via successive DNS queries for all NSEC RRs in that zone.</t>
