      <t>Multicast Tunnels are built between Provider Edge (PE) routers to allow multicast communication between different site's of a VPN. The MT tunnel has a destination MDT group address that is unique to the VPN. All routers that act as PE's and are configured for a specific VPN join the VPN MDT multicast group in the backbone of the provider network to be able to receive each others packets. Each router is also a sender to the MDT group. How the forwarding of the MDT packets is achieved is depending on the PIM mode of the MDT group. This can be either PIM-Bidir, PIM-SM or PIM SSM. The proposal in this document is related specifically to PIM SSM mode.</t>
