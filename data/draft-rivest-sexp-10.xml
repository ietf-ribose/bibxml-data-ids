      <t>This memo specifies the data structure representation that was devised in 1996/1997 to support SPKI (RFC 2692) certificates with the intent that it be more widely applicable. It has been and is being used elsewhere. There are multiple implementations in a variety of programming languages. Uses of this representation are referred to in this document as "S-expressions". This memo makes precise the encodings of these SPKI S-expressions: it gives a "canonical form" for them, describes two "transport" representations, and also describe an "advanced" format for display to people.</t>
