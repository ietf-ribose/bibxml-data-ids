      <t>In this document a formal model of a policy is presented in the context of a generic AAA environment. We will focus our attention on that kind of policy that is evaluated in response to a request of a user [OBJMSG]. That policy will determine all requirements that need to be fulfilled before the service asked for will be delivered. We will introduce the concept of a Driving Policy.</t>
