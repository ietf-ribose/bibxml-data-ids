    <abstract>
      <t>In recent years, the concept of near-data computing has been widely recognized in storage architectures. The core idea is to process data nearby, reduce the overhead of network transmission, and utilize the computing capability of smart devices (such as intelligent NICs, smart SSDs, and DPUs). This reduces CPU and memory usage of clients (computing nodes) and improves data processing efficiency. This design idea is applied in NFSv4.2 or future NFS verions, such as Server-Side Copy, in which client sends the control command and the storage server copies data without passing through the data between the client and storage server. Compared with traditional copy operations, data is read from the source storage server and then written to the target storage server after two network transmissions. Data transmission on the network is reduced, and bandwidth resources are greatly released. In addition, the client changes from an original data copy executor to a data copy controller, and a specific execution action is executed by the storage server. Therefore, a large amount of computing resources and memory resources are saved on the client side.</t>
