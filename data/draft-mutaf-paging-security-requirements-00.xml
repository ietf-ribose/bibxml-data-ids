      <t>This document contains a risk assessment of IP paging. The described risks are probably independent of any underlying functional architecture and mobility protocol. Accordingly, several security requirements are defined. These requirements are to be supported by an IP paging protocol in order to completely defeat or not to encourage the relevant attacks.</t>
