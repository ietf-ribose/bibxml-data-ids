      <t>This document proposes the repurposing of the currently unused spares2 field within the nvldbentry and uvldbentry structures. The primary objective is to utilize this field for storing the timestamp representing the date and time when a given volume location entry was locked. To make this possible, this memo requests the allocation of a new capability bit, VLDB_CAPABILITY_LOCKTIMESTAMP, to be advertised by the Volume Location Server. When advertised, this bit indicates that the server has the capacity to provide the timestamp in question.</t>
