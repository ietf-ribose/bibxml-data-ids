    <abstract>
      <t>An IGP Flexible Algorithm (Flex-Algorithm) enables the computation of constraint-based paths within an IGP domain, allowing operators to influence path selection according to administrative policies. This document defines an extension to Flex-Algorithm that allows the inclusion or exclusion of links from path computation based on Administrative Groups (also known as link affinities) associated with the reverse direction of the path under computation. This extension enhances the path selection capabilities of Flex- Algorithm by enabling reverse-affinity-based constraints, which are particularly useful for scenarios where path symmetry or directional link attributes are operationally significant.</t>
