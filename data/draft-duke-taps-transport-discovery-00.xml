      <t>The Transport Services architecture decouples applications from the protocol implementations that transport their data. While it is often straightforward to connect applications with transports that are present in the host operating system, providing a means of discovering user-installed implementations dramatically enlarges the use cases. This document discusses considerations for the design of a discovery mechanism and an example of such a design. Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the TAPS IETF mailing list taps@ietf.org or on the GitHub repository which contains the draft: https://github.com/martinduke/draft-duke-taps-transport- discovery.</t>
