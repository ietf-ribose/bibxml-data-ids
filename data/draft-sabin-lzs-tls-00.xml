    <abstract>
      <t>This memo proposes a compression method for the TLS protocol based on the LZS compression algorithm. The method can be used to compress the contents of a TLS record. The compression method proposed here is stateless, meaning that a record can be decompressed independently of any other record. Compression is performed prior to the encryption operation, which has the side benefit of reducing the amount of data that must be encrypted. This memo anticipates a forthcoming draft of ESP that will supercede [Atkins96]. The forthcoming draft will allow for ESP payloads to be compressed via transforms such as the one described in this memo.</t>
