      <t>This document is submitted to the SIMPLE WG as part of the ongoing discussion on the selection of the protocol for support of Session Based Instant Messaging. It evaluates the suitability of the IMSX protocol as a transport for Session Based IM. IMSX defines a BEEP profile for exchanging CPIM messages after SIP has performed its session setup signaling. This document evaluates IMSX against the IMPP requirements and its ability to interoperate with other IM systems based upon the CPIM profile.</t>
