      <t>We propose to strongly reduce the usage of Neighbor Discovery in WSNby ignoring the global IPv6 prefix inside the WSN. The IPv6 prefixwill be added (resp. removed) by the Border Router during the headerdecompression (resp. compression). This proposal has three mainadvantages: (i) reduce the number of exchanges inside the WSN, (ii)reduce the time needed by a sensor node to join the WSN (this isimportant when sensors are moving inside the WSN) and finally (iii)simplify multi-homing management. This document also studies theimpact of this proposal on different architectures (star, mesh, routeover) with LOWPAN_IPHC Encoding Format.</t>
