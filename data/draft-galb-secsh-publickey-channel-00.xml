      <t>SECSH defines an authentication mechanism that is based on publickeys, but does not define any mechanism for key distribution.No common key management solution exists in current implementations.This document describes a channel that can be used to configurepublic keys in an implementation-independent fashion, allowingclient software to take on the burden of this configuration.The public key channel provides a server-independent mechanismfor clients to add public keys, remove public keys, and listthe current public keys known by the server. Rights to managepublic keys are specific and limited to the authenticated user.A public key may also be associated with a mandatory command.</t>
