      <t>Today, the wireless network arena is made up of different types ofaccess (TDMA, CDMA, GSM, etc) and core network technologies (IS-41and MAP over SS7, etc). The heterogeneous nature of today'swireless and wireline packet data networks limits the scope ofmobility between these heterogeneous networks. However, as theseheterogeneous networks evolve, the mobility management provided bythem must evolve to ensure seamless roaming between the networks.With the convergence of voice and data, networks of the future willbe built on IP packet switched technology, mostly due to inherentadvantages offered by the technology.This document identifies several drivers that provide input for anIP Mobility based network and also describes a high level IPMobility architecture that extends the current third generationIMT2000 wireless architecture and builds on Mobile IP concepts.</t>
