      <t>The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection protocol (BFD) is used to detect loss of connectivity between two forwarding elements, typically with low latency. BFD is leveraged by routing protocols, including the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), to use that detection of loss of connectivity to bring down the protocol connections faster than the native protocol timers. This document defines a Subcode for the BGP Cease NOTIFICATION message for when a BGP connection is being closed due to a BFD session going down.</t>
