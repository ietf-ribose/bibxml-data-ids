      <t>This document specifies the Extensible Authentication Protocol overUDP (EAPoUDP) to be used for network access authentication. Anaccess domain is represented by one or many PANA AuthenticationAgents (PAAs). Before a PANA Client (PaC) is granted access to thedomain, a PAA and a PaC MAY use EAPoUDP to authenticate each other.EAPoUDP is a variation of the Extensible Authentication Protocol(PPP EAP) [2], but runs instead over IP - either IPv4 or IPv6.Unlike PPP EAP, EAPoUDP allows authentication over any link layertechnology. Furthermore, the PAA and the PaC need not be on the samelink. EAPoUDP uses UDP as its transport protocol.</t>
