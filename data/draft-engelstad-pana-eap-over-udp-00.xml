      <t>This document specifies the Extensible Authentication Protocol over UDP (EAPoUDP) to be used for network access authentication. An access domain is represented by one or many PANA Authentication Agents (PAAs). Before a PANA Client (PaC) is granted access to the domain, a PAA and a PaC MAY use EAPoUDP to authenticate each other. EAPoUDP is a variation of the Extensible Authentication Protocol (PPP EAP) [2], but runs instead over IP - either IPv4 or IPv6. Unlike PPP EAP, EAPoUDP allows authentication over any link layer technology. Furthermore, the PAA and the PaC need not be on the same link. EAPoUDP uses UDP as its transport protocol.</t>
