    <abstract>
      <t>In a Split-NVE architructure, the functions of the NVE are split across the hypervisor/container on a server and an external network equipment which is called an external NVE. A control plane protocol(s) between a hypervisor and its associated external NVE(s) is used for the hypervisor to distribute its virtual machine networking state to the external NVE(s) for further handling. This document illustrates the functionality required by this type of control plane signaling protocol and outlines the high level requirements. Virtual machine states as well as state transitioning are summarized to help clarifying the needed protocol requirements.</t>
