      <t>A routing registry(RR) is a repository of routing policy information. The IETF-RPSL-WG has developed a Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL) for describing routing policy constraints. This document addresses the need for providing the means of managing the routing registry as well as to provide access to the routing registry from within the Internet standard network management framework. It defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community to monitor and manage the RRs.</t>
