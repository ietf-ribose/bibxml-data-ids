      <t>This memo discusses the application of lossless compression technology to the IP Security Architecture [IPSecArch]. Over the last few several months, a number of lively debates on this topic have been held on IPSec mailing list. This memo discusses the issues raised, the alternatives available to resolve them and provides a set of recommendations to bring resolution to the issue. The goals of the draft are to: (1) define the problem solved by the use of compression in the context of IPSec, (2) review the use of compression and security technologies as they have been applied in other layers of the protocol stack, (3) outline a set of requirements for applying compression to IPSec, (4) discuss alternative methods which can be implemented to meet the requirements, and (4) propose a set of recommendations for consideration by the working group.</t>
