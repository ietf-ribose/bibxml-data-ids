      <t>This document describes how to discover the need of transcoding services in a session established with SIP and how to invoke those transcoding services. Two models for transcoding services invocation are introduced; the conference bridge model and the third party call control model. Both models meet the requirements for SIP regarding transcoding services invocation to support deaf, hard of hearing and speech-impaired individuals.</t>
