      <t>This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow seamlessIP multicast datagram delivery to mobile nodes in the Internet. Inorder to receive IP multicast datagrams, mobile nodes are notrequired to be identified by their unicast IP addresses. Forunicast communication using Mobile IP, each mobile node needs tohave a unicast home address and a care-of address. Following ahandover to another IP subnet, such a mobile node is able toreceive IP multicast traffic after exchanging IGMP messages withthe multicast routers on the currently visiting network. However,in the worst case, it takes an unreasonably long time (especiallywith respect to streaming media) to resume receiving multicast IPtraffic in the visiting network.This draft specifies a Mobility Support Agent (MSA) protocol whichprovides a mechanism to help ensure seamless reception of IPmulticast traffic despite a mobile node handover. This is possiblebecause in advance of its handover, a mobile node pre-registerswith the MSA on the next network to be visited. The MSA acts as aproxy for this mobile node and is thus able to set up all thenecessary states for the seamless delivery of multicast traffic tothis mobile node.</t>
