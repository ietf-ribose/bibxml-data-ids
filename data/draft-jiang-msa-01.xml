      <t>This document specifies protocol enhancements that allow seamless IP multicast datagram delivery to mobile nodes in the Internet. In order to receive IP multicast datagrams, mobile nodes are not required to be identified by their unicast IP addresses. For unicast communication using Mobile IP, each mobile node needs to have a unicast home address and a care-of address. Following a handover to another IP subnet, such a mobile node is able to receive IP multicast traffic after exchanging IGMP messages with the multicast routers on the currently visiting network. However, in the worst case, it takes an unreasonably long time (especially with respect to streaming media) to resume receiving multicast IP traffic in the visiting network. This draft specifies a Mobility Support Agent (MSA) protocol which provides a mechanism to help ensure seamless reception of IP multicast traffic despite a mobile node handover. This is possible because in advance of its handover, a mobile node pre-registers with the MSA on the next network to be visited. The MSA acts as a proxy for this mobile node and is thus able to set up all the necessary states for the seamless delivery of multicast traffic to this mobile node.</t>
