      <t>This document discusses several mechanisms for simplifying authentication of dual-stack SIP+XMPP clients against the corresponding SIP and XMPP services.

In other words, the goal here is to agree on a set of recommendations that would encourage client developers to implement simple UIs that would only require users to provide an ID and a password when configuring their SIP+XMPP account for the first time (as opposed to having to do so separately for SIP and XMPP).</t>
