      <t>This document discusses several mechanisms for simplifyingauthentication of dual-stack SIP+XMPP clients against thecorresponding SIP and XMPP services. The text is not attempt todefine a complex credential sharing protocol but rather to determineand eventually encourage use of a simple mechanism that would allowservice providers to host a SIP+XMPP solution appearing as a singleservice to their users. In other words, the goal here is to agree ona set of recommendations that would encourage client developers toimplement simple UIs that would only require users to provide an IDand a password when configuring their SIP+XMPP account for the firsttime (as opposed to having to do so separately for SIP and XMPP).</t>
