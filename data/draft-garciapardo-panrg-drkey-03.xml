    <abstract>
      <t>DRKey is a pragmatic Internet-scale key-establishment system that allows any host to locally obtain a symmetric key to enable a remote service to perform source-address authentication, and enables first- packet authentication. The remote service can itself locally derive the same key with efficient cryptographic operations. DRKey was developed with path aware networks in mind, but it is also applicable to today's Internet. It can be incrementally deployed and it offers incentives to the parties using it independently of its dissemination in the network.</t>
