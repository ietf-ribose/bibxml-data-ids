      <t>This document describes a way to distribute secure key for optimizing AAA authentication procedure while a mobile node is away from it's home. The AAA infrastrucrue is used as an underlying framework which enables a Mobile-IPv6 node to get an global authentication by identifying it with an unique identifier NAI. The Diameter messages are exchanged to transfer information of mobile node between home and foreign AAA servers. The steps to complete an authentication procedure for mobile node in the visited link may be reduced by delegating the role for generating and synchronizing keys to AAA server in the visited domain. The implications to existing entities supporting mobility such as attendant, AAA server in home and visited domain are discussed. The delegation is introduced and the related security issues are pointed out.</t>
