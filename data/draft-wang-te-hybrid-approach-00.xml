      <t>Currently a common approach to IP network traffic engineering is the overlay approach where explicit end to end MPLS LSPs between all possible edge nodes are established to form a full mesh virtual network on top of the physical topology. By carefully choosing the routes for these LSPs, one can completely control how traffic flows across the network and therefore achieve any given traffic engineering objective. However scalability is a serious concern with this approach because it requires N square number of LSPs where N is the number of nodes.</t>
