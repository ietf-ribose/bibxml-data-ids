      <t>Network mobility is proposed to let a mobile network change its point of attachment and still to keep all nodes attached to the mobile network globally reachable. However, due to scare bandwidth, limited signaling coverage and frequent link failure, a mobile network needs multihoming, i.e., multiple paths simultaneously to access the Internet, on the perspective of performance and reliability. The document specifies how to support multihoming in network mobility using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The proposed Multihomed SIP-based Network Mobility (SIP-NEMO) can dynamically select a path per session according to the status of egress interfaces and/or gateways.</t>
