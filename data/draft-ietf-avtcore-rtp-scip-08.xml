    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the RTP payload format of the Secure Communication Interoperability Protocol (SCIP). SCIP is an application layer protocol that provides end-to-end capability exchange, packetization/de-packetization of media, reliable transport, and security services such as confidentiality and integrity protection. SCIP handles packetization/de-packetization of the encrypted media and acts as a tunneling protocol, treating SCIP payloads as opaque octets to be encapsulated within RTP payloads prior to transmission or decapsulated on reception. SCIP payloads are sized to fit within the maximum transmission unit (MTU) when transported over RTP thereby avoiding fragmentation. SCIP provides confidentiality and integrity of the tunneled media, therefore the SCIP payload does not require the use of Secure RTP (SRTP) for payload protection. SCIP also provides for reliable transport at the application layer, so it is not necessary to negotiate RTCP retransmission capabilities. To establish reliable communications using SCIP over RTP, it is important that middle boxes avoid parsing or modifying SCIP payloads. Because SCIP payloads are confidentiality and integrity protected and are only decipherable by the originating and receiving SCIP devices, modification of the payload by middle boxes would be detected as an integrity failure in SCIP devices, resulting in retransmission and/or communication failure. Middle boxes do not need to parse the SCIP payloads to correctly transport them. Not only is parsing unnecessary to tunnel/detunnel SCIP within RTP, but the parsing and filtering of SCIP payloads by middle boxes would likely lead to ossification of the evolving SCIP protocol.</t>
