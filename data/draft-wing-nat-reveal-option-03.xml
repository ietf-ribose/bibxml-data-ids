      <t>When an IP address is shared among several subscribers -- with a NAT or with an application-level proxy -- it is impossible for the server to differentiate between different clients. Such differentiation is valuable in several scenarios. This memo describes a technique to differentiate TCP clients sharing an IP address. The proposed method uses a TCP option, which avoids altering the application-level payload and works well with SSL-protected connections.</t>
