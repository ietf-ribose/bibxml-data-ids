      <t>This draft describes a simple, incremental, network-based protocol to implement separation of Internet addresses into Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and Routing Locators (RLOCs). This mechanism requires no changes to host stacks and no major changes to existing database infrastructures. The proposed protocol can be implemented in a relatively small number of routers. This proposal was stimulated by the problem statement effort at the Amsterdam IAB Routing and Addressing Workshop (RAWS), which took place in October 2006.</t>
