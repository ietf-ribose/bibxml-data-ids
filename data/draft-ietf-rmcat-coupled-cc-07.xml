    <abstract>
      <t>When multiple congestion controlled Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions traverse the same network bottleneck, combining their controls can improve the total on-the-wire behavior in terms of delay, loss and fairness. This document describes such a method for flows that have the same sender, in a way that is as flexible and simple as possible while minimizing the amount of changes needed to existing RTP applications. It specifies how to apply the method for the Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA) congestion control algorithm, and provides suggestions on how to apply it to other congestion control algorithms.</t>
