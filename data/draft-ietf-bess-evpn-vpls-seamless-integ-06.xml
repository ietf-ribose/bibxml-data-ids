    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies mechanisms for backward compatibility of Ethernet VPN (EVPN) and Provider Backbone Bridge Ethernet VPN (PBB- EVPN) solutions with Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) and Provider Backbone Bridge VPLS (PBB-VPLS) solutions. It also provides mechanisms for seamless integration of these two technologies in the same MPLS/IP network on a per-VPN-instance basis. Implementation of this document enables service providers to introduce EVPN/PBB-EVPN PEs in their brown-field deployments of VPLS/PBB-VPLS networks. This document specifies control-plane and forwarding behavior needed for auto-discovery of a VPN instance, multicast and unicast operation, as well as MAC-mobility operation in order to enable seamless integration between EVPN and VPLS PEs as well as between PBB-VPLS and PBB-EVPN PEs.</t>
