      <t>This document describes the Secure Object Delivery Protocol (SODP). SODP enables clients to obtain secured packages from a Secure Object Management System (SOMS). Packages supported by a SOMS server include but are not limited to: firmware packages [RFC4108], trust anchor (TA) packages [RFC5934], symmetric key packages [RFC6031], asymmetric key packages [RFC5958], encrypted key packages [RFC6031], public key certificate enrollment packages [RFC5272], public key certificates [RFC5280], and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) [RFC5280]. Client access is ideally direct and web-based, but access via agents acting on behalf of clients is supported.</t>
