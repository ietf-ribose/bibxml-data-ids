      <t>This document describes a transformation method for representingnon-ASCII characters in host name parts in a fashion that is completelycompatible with the current DNS. It is a potential candidate for anASCII-Compatible Encoding (ACE) for internationalized host names, asdescribed in the comparison document from the IETF IDN Working Group.This method is based on the observation that many internationalized hostname parts will have a few substrings from a small number of rows of theISO 10646 repertoire. Run-length encoding for these types ofhost names will be fairly compact, and is fairly easy to describe.</t>
