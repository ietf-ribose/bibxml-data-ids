    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a transformation method for representing non-ASCII characters in host name parts in a fashion that is completely compatible with the current DNS. It is a potential candidate for an ASCII-Compatible Encoding (ACE) for internationalized host names, as described in the comparison document from the IETF IDN Working Group. This method is based on the observation that many internationalized host name parts will have a few substrings from a small number of rows of the ISO 10646 repertoire. Run-length encoding for these types of host names will be fairly compact, and is fairly easy to describe.</t>
