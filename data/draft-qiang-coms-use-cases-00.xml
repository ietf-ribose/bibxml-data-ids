    <abstract>
      <t>The Common Operation and Management of network Slicing (COMS) intends to provide a comprehensive approach for the overall operation and management of network slicing in the scope if IETF. The system is designed in a hierarchical and inter-operative manner. COMS is capable of recursive adaption in a hierarchical network management system. It is also independent of data plane technologies used in different administrative domains. Both network slice operator and network slice tenant may benefit for COMS for the purpose of slice management and maitenance.The purpose of this document is to discuss the use cases of COMS in different views.</t>
