      <t>Virtual private networks are becoming a common offering of many service providers. There are many technologies with which to implement a VPN service, ranging from MPLS to GRE to IPSEC. A common requirement of all VPN technologies is the need to discover all of the sites, or at least all the provider equipment associated with the sites, that are in a particular VPN. DNS provides a simple and commonly available mechanism for site discovery that is independent of any signaling or tunneling protocol. This draft proposes the use of DNS as a discovery mechanism for VPN maintenance and control.</t>
