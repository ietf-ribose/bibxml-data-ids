      <t>APN (Application-aware Networking) architecture aims to convey Application-aware Information including application/user/flow identifiers and SLA/service requirements along with the data packets into the network and make the network aware of applications and their requirements in order to provide corresponding application-aware network services and guarantee their SLA requirements. There have been challenges of the privacy and security issues that could potentially be introduced by conveying the application-aware information into the network. This document describes the security and privacy considerations of APN in various possible scenarios wherein APN will be deployed.</t>
