      <t>This text formulates a specialized network concept to support communication constraints in automated systems. These specialized networks, formulated as Operations and Control networks (OCN), are significant to many application scenarios involving the control and monitoring of mechanical and digital devices. The document defines the OCN reference model, describing the associated components, interfaces, and reference points. The reference model is independent of any specific technology. Standardized mechanisms will facilitate large-scale machine-to-machine communication and help with the integration between OCN and the Internet.</t>
