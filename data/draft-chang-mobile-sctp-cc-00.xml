    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a novel error and congestion control algorithm for mobile Stream Control Transmission Protocol (mSCTP). This algorithm is simple but very effective means to minimize the lost packet recovery time as well as the handover latency by capitalizing on the transport layer awareness of the mobility.</t>
