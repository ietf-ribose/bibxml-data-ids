    <abstract>
      <t>Over time, the document series associated with the IETF has grown and changed. One such change is the increase in the use of secondary markers to identify when documents fit specific categories and, especially, when they are or are not the product of specific IETF processes. The author believes that these secondary markers have largely failed but that the distinctions they were meant to draw remain valuable. A new set of category labels is proposed to re-emphasize these distinctions. The formal categories proposed are Internet Note, Candidate Specification, Proposed IETF Standard, Confirmed IETF Standard, and External Internet Engineering Document. These may be informally understood as ideas which are unbaked, baking, baked, eaten, and boiled.</t>
