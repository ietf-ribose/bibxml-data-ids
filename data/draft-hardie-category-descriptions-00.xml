      <t>Over time, the document series associated with the IETF has grownand changed. One such change is the increase in the use ofsecondary markers to identify when documents fit specificcategories and, especially, when they are or are not the productof specific IETF processes. The author believes that thesesecondary markers have largely failed but that the distinctionsthey were meant to draw remain valuable. A new set of categorylabels is proposed to re-emphasize these distinctions. The formalcategories proposed are Internet Note, Candidate Specification,Proposed IETF Standard, Confirmed IETF Standard, and ExternalInternet Engineering Document. These may be informally understoodas ideas which are unbaked, baking, baked, eaten, and boiled.</t>
