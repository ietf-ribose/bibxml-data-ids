      <t>The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API), as defined in RFC-1508 and subsequent Internet Draft documents, provides security services to callers (applications) in a generic fashion, supportable with a range of underlying mechanisms and technologies, allowing source-level portability of applications to different environments. Multi-party security contexts, where security context information is shared amongst more than two session peers, have received little consideration within the scope of the GSS-API. This document describes details of one approach for supporting multi-party security services within the GSS-API.</t>
