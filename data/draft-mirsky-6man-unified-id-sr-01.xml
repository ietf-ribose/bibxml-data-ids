      <t>Segment Routing architecture leverages the paradigm of source routing. It can be realized in a network data plane by prepending the packet with a list of instructions, a.k.a. segments. A segment can be encoded as a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) label, IPv4 address or IPv6 address. Segment Routing can be applied in MPLS data plane by encoding segments in MPLS label stack. It also can be applied to IPv6 data plane by encoding list of segment identifiers in IPv6 Segment Routing Extension Header (SRH). This document extends the use of the SRH to segment identifiers encoded as MPLS label and IPv4 address.</t>
