    <abstract>
      <t>YANG-based service APIs are widely used to expose network and service abstractions to external systems such as controllers, orchestration platforms, and OSS/BSS applications. Despite the availability of numerous YANG data models and YANG-to-API tools, operators continue to face significant challenges in operationalizing these APIs in a consistent, scalable, and interoperable manner. APIs derived from similar YANG models often differ in semantics, lifecycle behavior, observability, and consumption patterns, complicating automation and cross-vendor integration. This document describes the problem space associated with operationalizing YANG-based service APIs, drawing on operator experience, IAB workshop findings, and IETF applicability studies to highlight gaps in current practices and motivate requirements for improving API predictability and operational effectiveness, without defining specific solutions, protocols, or tools.</t>
