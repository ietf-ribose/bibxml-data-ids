      <t>The HyperText Transfer Protocol, version 1.1 (HTTP/1.1), provides simple support for applications which allow remote editing of typed data. In practice, the existing capabilities of HTTP/1.1 have proven inadequate to support efficient, scalable remote editing free of overwriting conflicts. This document presents a list of features in the form of requirements which, if implemented, would improve the efficiency of common remote editing operations, provide a locking mechanism to prevent overwrite conflicts, improve relationship management support between non-HTML data types, provide a simple attribute-value metadata facility, and provide for the creation and reading of container data types. These requirements are also supportive of versioning capability.</t>
