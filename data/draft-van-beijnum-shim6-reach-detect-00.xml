      <t>The shim6 working group is developing a mechanism that allowsmultihoming by using multiple addresses. When communication between theinitially chosen addresses for a transport session is no longerpossible, a "shim" layer makes it possible to switch to a different setof addresses without breaking current transport protocol assumptions.This draft discusses the issues of detecting failures in a currentlyused address pair between two hosts ("current pair reachability") andand picking a new address pair to be used when a failure occurs ("fullpath exploration").</t>
