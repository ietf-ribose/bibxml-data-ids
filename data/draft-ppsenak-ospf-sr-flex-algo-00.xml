      <t>IGP protocols traditionally compute best paths over the network based on the IGP metric assigned to the links. Many network deployments use RSVP-TE based or Segment Routing based Traffic Engineering to enforce traffic over a path that is computed using different metrics or constraints than the shortest IGP path. Various mechanisms are used to steer the traffic towards such traffic engineered paths. This document proposes a solution that allows IGPs themselves to compute constraint based paths over the network without the use of the above mentioned traffic engineering technologies.</t>
