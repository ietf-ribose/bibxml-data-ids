      <t>Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality ofservice for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. Theoverall PCN architecture is described in RFC 5559. This memodescribes a behaviour for PCN egress nodes known as the"piggybacking" edge behaviour, because it "piggybacks" PCNinformation in resource signalling messages. This version of thememo describes two alternatives, where piggybacking is derived fromthe CL edge behaviour and where it is derived from the SM edgebehaviour. The SM and CL edge behaviours are specified in companiondocuments.</t>
