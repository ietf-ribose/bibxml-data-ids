      <t>This Internet-Draft describes a means to add metadata striping to pNFS. The text of this draft is substantially based on prior drafts by Eisler, M., with some departures. The current draft attempts to define a somewhat lighter-weight protocol, in particular, seeks to permit striping for ?filehandle only? operations such as LOCK and OPEN + CLAIM_FH, without clients having to obtain metadata layouts on regular files. We gratefully acknowledge the primary contributions of Mike Eisler, Pranoop Ersani, and others.Internet Draft Comments Comments regarding this draft are solicited.</t>
