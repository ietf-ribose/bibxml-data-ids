      <t>A Timeout header is defined for Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).This end-to-end header informs an origin server and anyintermediaries of the maximum time that a client will await aresponse to its request. A server can use this header to ensure thata timely response is generated. This also identifies requests asbeing potentially long-lived, and allows for better resourceallocation for these requests.A Connection-Timeout header is defined for HTTP. This hop-by-hopheader informs the entity at the other end of a connection of themaximum time that an idle connection is kept open. This headerimproves reliability by providing better information about the idleconnection management policy of HTTP hosts.Comments and feedback for this draft should be directed to theauthors and the Apps Discuss list (discuss@apps.ietf.org).</t>
