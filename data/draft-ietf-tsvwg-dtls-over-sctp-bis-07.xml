    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the usage of the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol to protect user messages sent over the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). It is an improved alternative to the existing RFC 6083. DTLS over SCTP provides mutual authentication, confidentiality, integrity protection, and partial replay protection for applications that use SCTP as their transport protocol and allows client/server applications to communicate in a way that is designed to give communications privacy and to prevent eavesdropping and detect tampering or message forgery. Applications using DTLS over SCTP can use almost all transport features provided by SCTP and its extensions. This document is an improved alternative to RFC 6083 and removes the 16 kbytes limitation on protected user message size by defining a secure user message fragmentation so that multiple DTLS records can be used to protect a single user message. It further contains a large number of security fixes and improvements. It updates the DTLS versions and SCTP-AUTH HMAC algorithms to use. It mitigates reflection attacks of data and control chunks and replay attacks of data chunks. It simplifies secure implementation by some stricter requirements on the establishment procedures as well as rekeying to align with zero trust principles.</t>
