      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility protocol which provides IP mobility for a regular IPv6 mobile node without the involvement of the IPv6 host. Whenever a mobile node is attached to a PMIPv6 domain via a mobility access gateway, MAG, it appears to the mobile node as if it is attached to the same home link and thus the mobile node may think that it is not roaming away from home. An issue has been raised with respect to the base PMIPv6 protocol support of a mobile node with multiple physical interfaces. This issue has been referenced as PMIPv6 support for multihoming mobile node. This document describes the multihoming issue as it relates to PMIPv6 and provides an analysis to all scenarios that have been identified thus far.</t>
