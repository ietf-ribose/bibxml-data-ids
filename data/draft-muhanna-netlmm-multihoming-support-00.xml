      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility protocol which providesIP mobility for a regular IPv6 mobile node without the involvement ofthe IPv6 host. Whenever a mobile node is attached to a PMIPv6 domainvia a mobility access gateway, MAG, it appears to the mobile node asif it is attached to the same home link and thus the mobile node maythink that it is not roaming away from home. An issue has beenraised with respect to the base PMIPv6 protocol support of a mobilenode with multiple physical interfaces. This issue has beenreferenced as PMIPv6 support for multihoming mobile node. Thisdocument describes the multihoming issue as it relates to PMIPv6 andprovides an analysis to all scenarios that have been identified thusfar.</t>
