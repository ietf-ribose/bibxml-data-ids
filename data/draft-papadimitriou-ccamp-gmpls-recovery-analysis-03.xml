      <t>This document provides an analysis grid that can be used to evaluate, compare and contrast the numerous Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)-based recovery mechanisms currently proposed at the CCAMP Working Group. A detailed analysis of each of the recovery phases is provided using the terminology defined in [CCAMP-TERM]. Also, this document focuses on transport plane survivability and recovery issues and not on control plane resilience and related aspects.</t>
