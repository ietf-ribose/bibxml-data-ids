      <t>The present draft describes an user-to-user (u2u) authenticated key exchange mechanism based on the UMTS AKA mechanism [1]. The proposed scheme is based on the generation of security tokens (in fact encrypted public Diffie-Hellman keys) by the peer's operator. Such a security token along with credential information contained within the peer's AKA Authentication Vector (AV) enables two communicating peers to securely derive a shared key.</t>
