      <t>This document describes a protocol that enables tunneling of Internet Protocol traffic over a Content Centric Network (CCN) or a Named Data Network (NDN). The target use case for such a protocol is to provide an IP mobility plane for mobile networks that might otherwise use IP- over-IP tunneling, such as the GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) used by the Evolved Packet Core in LTE networks (LTE-EPC). By leveraging the elegant, built-in support for mobility provided by CCN or NDN, this protocol achieves performance on par with LTE-EPC, equivalent efficiency, and substantially lower implementation and protocol complexity. Furthermore, the use of CCN/NDN for this purpose paves the way for the deployment of ICN native applications on the mobile network.</t>
