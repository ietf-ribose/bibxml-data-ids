      <t>This document illustrates a way to integrate a new class of nodes and links in segment routing to represent networks in an opaque way for further extensibility of the link-state protocols that help with segment routing. An instance of the opaque definition would be optical networks that are typically transport centric. In the IP centric network, this will help in defining a common control protocol for packet optical integration that will include optical paths as opaque 'segments' or sub-paths as an augmentation to the defined extensions of segment routing. This opaque option defines a general mechanism to allow for future extensibility of segment routing.</t>
