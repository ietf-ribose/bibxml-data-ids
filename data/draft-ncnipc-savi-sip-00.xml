      <t>The session initiation protocol(SIP) which designed by IETF is also being considered as the core protocol for multimedia communication. This document describes a source address validation Improvement(SAVI) solution for SIP protocol or other security mechanisms. The SAVI was developed to prevent IP source address spoofing which can enable impersonation and malicious traffic redirection. The SAVI can be used in both IPV4/V6 networks. In the work we presented here, we describe the advantages of using SAVI in SIP and the approaches for using SIP in networks, whether in the registrar, redirect, and any procedures of the SIP protocol .This document describes different deployment scenarios, with solutions for when the nodes in the network using the SIP to contact each other.</t>
