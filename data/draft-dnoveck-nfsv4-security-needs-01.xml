      <t>This document discusses the existing inadequacies in the handling of security issues within the NFSv4 protocols and the steps that need to be taken to correct the situation, including the preparation of new standards-track documents updating existing treatments of NFSv4 security. Because the security approach has been and should remain the same for all minor versions, it is expected that the basics of security for all the NFSv4 protocols will be addressed together in a single NFSv4-wide standards-track document.</t>
