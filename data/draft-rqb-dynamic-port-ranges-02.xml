      <t>This document describes and extension of the port range assignment mechanisms used for the IPv4 address sharing framework (SHARA) that is based on port range routing. The extension provides means for dynamically changes port range assignments by allowing clients to smoothly migrate to a new port range before releasing the range that is currently in use. This way, the number of ports per client can be adjusted to actual usage patterns.</t>
