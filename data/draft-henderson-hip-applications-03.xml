      <t>The Host Identity Protocol and architecture (HIP) proposes to add a cryptographic name space for network stack names. From an application viewpoint, HIP-enabled systems support a new address family (e.g., AF_HOST), but it may be a long time until such HIP- aware applications are widely deployed even if host systems are upgraded. This informational document discusses implementation and API issues relating to using HIP in situations in which the system is HIP-aware but the applications are not.</t>
