      <t>If encryption is performed under a single key, there is a certain maximum threshold amount of data that can be safely encrypted. This amount is called key lifetime. This specification contains a description of a variety of methods to increase the lifetime of symmetric keys. It provides external and internal re-keying mechanisms based on hash functions and on block ciphers that can be used with such modes of operations as CTR, GCM, CCM, CBC, CFB, OFB and OMAC.</t>
