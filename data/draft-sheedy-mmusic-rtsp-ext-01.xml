      <t>This document proposes enhancements to the RTSP protocol for broadcast quality non-IP based video- on-demand applications. Additional transports for non-IP delivery of media streams are proposed, along with control extensions to reduce latency. These proposals are based on nCUBE Corporation's and Oracle Corporation's experience with their existing media servers.</t>
