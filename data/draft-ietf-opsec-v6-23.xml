    <abstract>
      <t>Knowledge and experience on how to operate IPv4 securely is available: whether it is the Internet or an enterprise internal network. However, IPv6 presents some new security challenges. RFC 4942 describes the security issues in the protocol, but network managers also need a more practical, operations-minded document to enumerate advantages and/or disadvantages of certain choices. This document analyzes the operational security issues associated with several types of network (enterprises, service providers, and residential users) and proposes technical and procedural mitigation techniques. The residential users case assumes a managed ISP CPE device. Some very specific types of networks such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanaged home networks are not discussed in this document.</t>
