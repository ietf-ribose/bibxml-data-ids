      <t>This document provides a terminology to be used when performingperformance test and benchmarking of wireless LAN (WLAN) switches andcontrollers, including systems comprising groups of controllers andAccess Points. The various wireless-specific device nomenclature, aswell as the definitions of configuration parameters and testconditions that may be used to characterize the performance of thesedevices, are provided. The document also defines some of the metricsused during WLAN switch benchmarking. This terminology is to be usedin conjunction with the companion methodology document.</t>
