      <t>This document provides a terminology to be used when performing performance test and benchmarking of wireless LAN (WLAN) switches and controllers, including systems comprising groups of controllers and Access Points. The various wireless-specific device nomenclature, as well as the definitions of configuration parameters and test conditions that may be used to characterize the performance of these devices, are provided. The document also defines some of the metrics used during WLAN switch benchmarking. This terminology is to be used in conjunction with the companion methodology document.</t>
