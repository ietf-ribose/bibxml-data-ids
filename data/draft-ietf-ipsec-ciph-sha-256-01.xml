      <t>This document describes the use of the HMAC algorithm in conjunctionwith the SHA-256 algorithm as an experimental authentication mecha-nism within the context of the IPsec AH and ESP protocols. This algo-rithm is intended to provide data origin authentication and integrityprotection. Given the current lack of practical experience withSHA-256, implementations based on this document will be experimentalin nature, and implementation is not required in order to claim com-pliance with the IPsec proposed standards. The version of the HMAC-SHA-256 authenticator described in this document specifies truncationto 128 bits, and is therefore named HMAC-SHA-256-128.</t>
