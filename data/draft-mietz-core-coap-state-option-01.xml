      <t>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained devices which are often equipped with sensors measuring a physical phenomenon such as temperature on a precise scale. These sensor values are made available by a resource on the CoAP endpoint. However, for many applications it is not necessary to have the full precision a sensor can provide. It's often even enough to only have some high-level states instead of raw values. This document presents a new option for CoAP to dynamically create new resources for a sensor which provides user-defined high-level states instead of raw sensor values.</t>
