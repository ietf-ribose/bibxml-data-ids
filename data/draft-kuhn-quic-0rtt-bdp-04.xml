      <t>The time-to-service duration depends on both peers exchange optimization. The peer initiating the connection may not be the one which send data first. Moreover, clients may be resource-limited, behind a low bandwidth or connected to a long-RTT network and may need to adapt dynamically to improve data reception. Currently, each side has its proprietary solution to measure and to store path characteristics. Having a standard way to share these parameters should improve the adaptation to a non standard path characteristics. QUIC v1 specification already reflects this approach. Having a symmetrical control of the optimization should reduce protocol ossification. This memo proposes the sharing of the characteristics of the path amongst the peer to reduce HTTP3 time-to-service for non default transport situation.</t>
