    <abstract>
      <t>This draft considers the potentially negative impacts of an increasing deployment of non-congestion-controlled or non-responsive traffic on the Internet. Traffic unresponsiveness could bring extremely unfairness against responsive TCP traffic and great service degradation. Differentiated Services (DS)[5,6], which has been proposed by IETF recently, aims to provide a scalable service differentiation in the Internet that can be used for differentiated payment. We argue that this could add the incentives of their customer to use unresponsive flow to achieve better service assurance against the competing traffic.</t>
