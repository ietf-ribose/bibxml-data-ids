      <t>Most MIME syntax and semantics can usually be processed in a single passthrough the data. For example, the MIME boundary parameter alwaysappears before it is used. This is not the case with multipart/alternative MIME entities. Theprocessor of the data cannot know the MIME types of the altnernativespresent until all alternatives have been processed. Thus, it is notpossible for a one pass processor to consider more than the first andmost limited representation, because a subsequent part may be somethingthat cannot be handled.</t>
