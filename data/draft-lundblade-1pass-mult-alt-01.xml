      <t>Most MIME syntax and semantics can usually be processed in a single pass through the data. For example, the MIME boundary parameter always appears before it is used. This is not the case with multipart/alternative MIME entities. The processor of the data cannot know the MIME types of the altnernatives present until all alternatives have been processed. Thus, it is not possible for a one pass processor to consider more than the first and most limited representation, because a subsequent part may be something that cannot be handled.</t>
