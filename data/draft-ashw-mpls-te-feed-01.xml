      <t>One key component of traffic engineering is a concept known asconstraint based routing. In constraint based routing a topologydatabase is maintained on all participating nodes. This databasecontains a complete list of all the links in the network thatparticipate in traffic engineering and for each of these links a setof constraints which those links can meet. Bandwidth, for example,is one essential constraint. Since the bandwidth available changesas new LSPs are established and terminated the topology databasewill develop inconsistencies with respect to the real network. It isnot possible to increase the flooding rates arbitrarily to keep thedatabase discrepancies from growing. We propose a new mechanismwhereby a source node can learn about the successes or failures ofits path selections by receiving feedback from the paths it isattempting. This fed-back information can be incorporated intosubsequent route computations, which greatly improves the accuracyof the overall routing solution by significantly reducing thedatabase discrepancies.</t>
