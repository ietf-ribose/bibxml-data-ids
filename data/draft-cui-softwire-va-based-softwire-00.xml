      <t>The increasing deployment of IPv6 networks in both customer networksand ISP networks leads to two common traversing transition scenarios:in the first scenario, an IPv6-only backbone network needs to provideIP connectivity between IPv4 networks, we call it IPv4-over-IPv6scenario; In the second scenario, IPv6 networks need to beinterconnected over an IPv4 transit network, we call it IPv6-over-IPv4 scenario. In both scenarios, the ISP operating the transitnetwork of one address family must offer transit services forattached client networks of the other address family. The SoftwireWG has defined softwire mesh mechanism [RFC5565] for the twotraversing scenarios. Softwire mesh uses automatic softwire tunnelsemploying multi-protocol BGP extensions for distributing E-IP routes,where both BGP peers and tunnels between PEs forms a full-mesharchitecture.Inspired by the Virtual Aggregation approach [I-D.ietf-grow-va] toIPv4 routing scalability, in this draft we proposed a scalablemechanism for distributing E-IP routes over the transit network. Oursolution can significantly reduce the forwarding information base(FIB) size at Address Family Border Routers (AFBRs) as well as thetotal amount of routing updates, and offers the ISP an easy way tomanage the transit service.</t>
