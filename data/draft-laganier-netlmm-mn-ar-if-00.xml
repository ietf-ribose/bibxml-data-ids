      <t>This document specify an IP layer interface between mobile nodes (MN)and access routers (AR) of a network-based localized mobilitymanagement (NetLMM) domain. Such an interface is subject to acertain number of threats, amongst which are attacks on the mappingbetween the MN Identifier and IPv6 address set. A bindingenforcement mechanism between those two is hence required to preventmalicious nodes to carry on various attacks like service theft ordenial-of-service attacks. In the absence of link-layer specificmechanisms enforcing this binding, it is required to implement suchmechanism at the IP layer MN-AR interface. Moreover, it is requiredthat no NetLMM specific software support is present on MNs. The IPlayer MN-AR interface described in this document fulfills these tworequirements by using the SEND public key as the MN identifier, whilebeing solely based on standard track IPv6 protocols (DNA and SEND)implemented by non-NetLMM MNs.</t>
