      <t>In response to address selection problem statement and requirement documents, this document describes solution approaches and evaluates proposed solution mechanisms in line with requirements. It also examines the applicability for each solution mechanism, and concludes that no single solution solves the problems and the combination of the solutions should be the way forward.</t>
