      <t>This document captures problems and issues discovered on the SIGTRAN mailing list and at M2PA Interoperability Tests. This document will be updated after each interoperability test to include any new issues. Two basic sets of problems are identified by this draft: (1) issues that need to be addressed in the next revision of the M2PA draft, and (2) issues that were found that are strictly implementation problems.</t>
