      <t>This document captures problems and issues discovered on the SIGTRANmailing list and at M2PA Interoperability Tests. This document will beupdated after each interoperability test to include any newissues. Two basic sets of problems are identified by this draft: (1)issues that need to be addressed in the next revision of the M2PAdraft, and (2) issues that were found that are strictly implementationproblems.</t>
