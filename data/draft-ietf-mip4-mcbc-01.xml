      <t>This document specifies a new Mobile IPv4 extension which is used to negotiate the Multicast-Broadcast Encapsulation Delivery style in the case of Mobile IPv4 Foreign Agent Care-of Address mode registration. With this extension the mobile node is able to negotiate the type of traffic that needs to be encapsulated for delivery to the foreign agent while other types of traffic use the direct delivery style. This mechanism eliminates the tunnel overhead between the mobile node and the foreign agent. Multicast and broadcast applications on a mobile IPv4 mobile node are better served with this extension.</t>
