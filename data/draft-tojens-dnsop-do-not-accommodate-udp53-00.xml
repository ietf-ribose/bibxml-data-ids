    <abstract>
      <t>Protocols that rely on Classic DNS have to account for considerations that only apply to UDP, such as message fragmentation. However, DNS implementations are already required to support both TCP and UDP, and using TCP would alleviate these considerations. This document specifies that new protocols with a dependency on Classic DNS do not need to account for the limitations of Classic DNS over UDP and can instead expect implementations to use Classic DNS over TCP.</t>
