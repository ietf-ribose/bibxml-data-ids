    <abstract>
      <t>BGP Flow Specification allows conveying flow specifications and traffic Action/Rules associated to perform different actions based on the traffic features. One of the applications is to steer one specific flow into its specific path. However, in some scenarios, the traffic forwarding paths are not constant and change over time. This document extends BGP Flow Specification with scheduling time information to identify the packets arrived at different time slot. Based on that, the headend can perform different actions at different time for the same traffic.</t>
