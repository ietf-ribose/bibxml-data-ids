      <t>The IEEE 802.1X protocol provides authenticated layer 2 network access. As part of the authentication for 802.1X, a device such as a switch or a wireless LAN access point can receive credentials from the authentication authority identifying the user of a device requesting access. These credentials can then be used by a DHCP server in the selection of an IP address for assignment to the device through its DHCP client. The 802.1X Credentials sub-option allows an access device that implements 802.1X and that can create DHCP Relay Agent options to pass along credentials for the user of a device received during 802.1X authentication to a DHCP server.</t>
