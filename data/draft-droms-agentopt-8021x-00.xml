      <t>The IEEE 802.1X protocol provides authenticated layer 2 networkaccess. As part of the authentication for 802.1X, a device such as aswitch or a wireless LAN access point can receive credentials fromthe authentication authority identifying the user of a devicerequesting access. These credentials can then be used by a DHCPserver in the selection of an IP address for assignment to the devicethrough its DHCP client. The 802.1X Credentials sub-option allows anaccess device that implements 802.1X and that can create DHCP RelayAgent options to pass along credentials for the user of a devicereceived during 802.1X authentication to a DHCP server.</t>
