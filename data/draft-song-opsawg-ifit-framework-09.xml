    <abstract>
      <t>Efficient network operation increasingly relies on data-plane telemetry. As networks increase in scale and network operations become more sophisticated, traditional Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) methods, which include proactive and reactive techniques, running in active and passive modes, become more susceptible to measurement accuracy and misconfiguration errors. With the advent of programmable data-plane, emerging on-path telemetry techniques provide unprecedented flow insight and realtime notification of network issues (e.g., jitter, increased latency, packet loss, significant bit error variations, and unequal load- balancing). This document enumerates several key deployment challenges and requirements for on-path telemetry techniques, especially in carrier operator networks. To address these issues, this document outlines a high-level framework, In-situ Flow Information Telemetry (iFIT). iFIT provides several essential components that can be assembled to achieve a complete and efficient solution for on-path telemetry. As a reference and open framework, iFIT only describes the basic functions of each identified component and suggests possible applications. It does not specify the implementation of the components and the interfaces between the components. The compliance of iFIT framework is not mandated either. This informational document aims to clarify the problem domain, and summarize the best practices and sensible system design considerations. The iFIT framework helps to guide the analysis on the current standard status and gaps, and motivate new works to complete the ecosystem. It also helps to inspire innovative network telemetry applications supporting advanced network operations.</t>
