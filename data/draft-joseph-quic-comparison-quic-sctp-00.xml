    <abstract>
      <t>To cumulate design lessons from our protocol development efforts, this document provides a preliminary comparison between two transport protocol designs, Stream Control Transport Protocol (SCTP) and Quick UDP Internet Connections (QUIC). We identify their commonalities and differences, summarize the characteristics of QUIC which we believe represent progresses in transport protocol designs. We hope this draft useful in helping others to gain further understanding of both SCTP and QUIC, and in future protocol design efforts.</t>
