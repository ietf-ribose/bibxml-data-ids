      <t>This document specifies the mapping of defect states betweenEthernet Attachment Circuits (ACs) and associated EthernetPseudowires (PWs) connected in accordance to the PWE3 architecture[RFC3985] to realize an end-to-end emulated Ethernet service. Thisdocument augments the mapping of defect states between a PW andassociated AC of the end-to-end emulated service in [PW-OAM-MSG-MAP]. In [PW-OAM-MSG-MAP], Ethernet OAM was not covered due to lackof Ethernet OAM maturity. However, since then, [Y.1731] and[802.1ag] have been completed, and this document specifies themapping of defect states between Ethernet ACs and correspondingEthernet PWs.Conventions used in this documentThe key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</t>
