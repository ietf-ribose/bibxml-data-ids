      <t>The interfaces of RESTful, hypertext-driven applications consist of reusable, self-descriptive components such as Internet media types and link relation types. This document defines a template that application designers can use to describe their application's interface in a structured way so that other parties can develop interoperable clients and servers or reuse the components in their own applications.</t>
