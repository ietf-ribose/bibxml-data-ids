      <t>OSPF [Ref1] is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used for routing in IP networks. Though the definition of the ABR in the current OSPF specification does not require a router with multiple attached areas to have a backbone connection, it is actually necessary to provide successful routing to the inter-area and external destinations. If this requirement is not met all traffic, destined for the areas not connected to such ab ABR or out of the OSPF domain, is dropped. The rules of originating and processing Summary-LSAs given in the current OSPF standard [Ref1] can also result in suboptimal inter-area routing. Though all these problems can be fixed using virtual links, this memo describes an alternative implementation of the OSPF ABR behavior, which allows the administrator to avoid it or, if virtual links are still used, to decrease the number of configured virtual links. This memo also describes possible situations where the proposed implementation can be used.</t>
