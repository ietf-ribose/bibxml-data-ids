      <t>The Public Switched Telephone Network includes several mechanisms that increase the probability of completion for telephone calls made by authorised disaster relief personnel during emergencies such as hurricanes or terrorist attacks. This memo describes the security requirements of providing this functionality in private and public IP networks, and how these requirements can be met using existing protocols. It also specifies which enhancements are necessary to these protocols to allow enhanced functionality such as roaming access.</t>
