      <t>The Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices via exchange of XML messages in textual representation. Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) is a W3C-recommended binary representation of XML Information Set, which is more efficient from both CPU and bandwidth utilization perspective. This document defines a capability-based extension to the NETCONF protocol that allows peers to agree to exchange protocol messages using EXI encoding.</t>
