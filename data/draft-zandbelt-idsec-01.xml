      <t>IDsec is a mechanism that provides an identity for users on the Internet. Identity in IDsec means that a user is known by a certain profile that contains precisely those attributes that the user wants to reveal to the requester of his profile. Access to profile attributes is managed by the user himself. Certificates and public/private key mechanisms ensure that information is exchanged in a secure way only between parties that trust each other.</t>
