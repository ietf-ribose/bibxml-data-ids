      <t>This document updates the recommendations for key shares algorithms (TLS supported groups; previously EC Named Curve Registry) in the light of the future arrival of cryptographically relevant quantum computers. [[ NOTE I use key share in the title and here as it's more accurate than "group" and perhaps more well known in the context TLS than key agreement or key exchange. ]]</t>
