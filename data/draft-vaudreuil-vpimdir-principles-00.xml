    <title>Voice Messaging Directory Service: Principles of Operation</title>
    <date year="1999" month="November" day="30"/>
    <abstract>
      <t>General electronic mail (email) provides a facility for exchanging messages of seemingly arbitrary content. In common email usage, text is the primary media with one or more attachments. A class of special-purpose computers has evolved to provide voice- messaging services. These machines generally interface to a telephone switch and provide call answering and voice messaging services. Message exchange between these voice-mail only systems can best be achieved using VPIM Version 2.</t>
