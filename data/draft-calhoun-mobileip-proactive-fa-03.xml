      <t>The Mobile IP protocol allows a Mobile Node to continue using thesame home address even after changing its point of attachment to theInternet. This provides transparency to most existing applicationsthat assume a fixed address and a fixed point of attachment.However, new applications, such as voice-over-IP, have additionalreal-time requirements such that a change in the point of attachmentwill cause a noticeable degradation of service unless additionalsteps are taken to reduce the latency of a handoff event.This specification proposes extensions to the Mobile IP protocol thatmay be used by Foreign Agents to set up a Mobile Node's visitorentry, and forward its packets, prior to receiving a formalRegistration Request from the Mobile Node. This enables a very rapidestablishment of service at the new point of attachment so that theeffect of the handoff on real-time applications is minimized.</t>
