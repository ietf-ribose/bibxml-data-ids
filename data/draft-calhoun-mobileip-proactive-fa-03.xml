    <abstract>
      <t>The Mobile IP protocol allows a Mobile Node to continue using the same home address even after changing its point of attachment to the Internet. This provides transparency to most existing applications that assume a fixed address and a fixed point of attachment. However, new applications, such as voice-over-IP, have additional real-time requirements such that a change in the point of attachment will cause a noticeable degradation of service unless additional steps are taken to reduce the latency of a handoff event. This specification proposes extensions to the Mobile IP protocol that may be used by Foreign Agents to set up a Mobile Node's visitor entry, and forward its packets, prior to receiving a formal Registration Request from the Mobile Node. This enables a very rapid establishment of service at the new point of attachment so that the effect of the handoff on real-time applications is minimized.</t>
