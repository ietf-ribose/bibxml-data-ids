      <t>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), as defined in STD 94 (RFC 8949), is a data representation format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. Among the kinds of data that a data representation format needs to be able to carry, numbers have a prominent role, but also have inherent complexity that needs attention from protocol designers and implementers of CBOR libraries and of the applications that use them. This document gives an overview over number formats available in CBOR and some notable CBOR tags registered, and it attempts to provide information about opportunities and potential pitfalls of these number formats. // This is a rather drafty initial revision, pieced together from // various components, so it has a higher level of redundancy than // ultimately desired.</t>
