    <abstract>
      <t>To provide equitable service to clients, servers often rate-limit incoming requests, often based upon the source IP address. However, oblivious HTTP removes the ability for the server to distinguish amongst clients so the server can only rate-limit traffic from the oblivious proxy. This harms all clients behind that oblivious proxy. This specification provides feedback from a server to an oblivious proxy, enabling the oblivious proxy to rate-limit incoming requests from clients. Cooperating oblivious proxies can thus provide more equitable service to their distinguishable clients without triggering rate-limiting on the request resource or the target resource that would impact all clients behind that Oblivious proxy.</t>
