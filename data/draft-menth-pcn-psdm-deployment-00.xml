      <t>This document presents different deployment models of PCN-basedadmission control (AC) and flow termination (FT) using packet-specific dual marking (PSDM) for encoding. Their major is that theyrequire only a single DSCP for packet marking and that they workreliably in the presence of ingress-egress aggregates (IEAs) withonly a very small average number of flows. Moreover, an advancedmodel even works with multipath routing.</t>
