      <t>This document presents different deployment models of PCN-based admission control (AC) and flow termination (FT) using packet- specific dual marking (PSDM) for encoding. Their major is that they require only a single DSCP for packet marking and that they work reliably in the presence of ingress-egress aggregates (IEAs) with only a very small average number of flows. Moreover, an advanced model even works with multipath routing.</t>
