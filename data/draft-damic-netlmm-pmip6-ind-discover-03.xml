      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is a network-based mobility protocol that enabesmobility management for an IP host as it moves across differentpoints of attachment within the mobility domain. An IP host whosemobility is being managed by the network is unaware of the accessnetworks capability to do mobility management on its behalf usingProxy Mobile IPv6. This draft proposes mechanisms by which the hostis informed of Proxy Mobile IPv6 support, as well as how to activelydiscover such capability in the network that host attaches to. Theability of the host to discover or be aware of Proxy Mobile IPv6support in the access network enables better decision making in termsof the network selection and attach procedure as well as the choiceof mobility management.</t>
