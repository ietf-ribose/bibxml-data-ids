      <t>This document defines an extension to 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery. This extension is designed for low-power and lossy network environments and it supports multi-hop operation. Nodes supporting this extension compute a Cryptographically Unique Interface ID and associate it with one or more of their Registered Addresses. The Cryptographic ID (Crypto-ID) uniquely identifies the owner of the Registered Address. It is used in place of the EUI-64 address that is specified in RFC 6775. Once an address is registered with a Cryptographic ID, only the owner of that ID can modify the state information of the Registered Address in the 6LR and 6LBR.</t>
