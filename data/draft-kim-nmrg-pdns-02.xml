      <t>With the advent of Software-Defined Networking(SDN), the networkenvironment has changed greatly to focus on users, and networkvirtualization technology has made great progress. However, networksthat are getting bigger and more advanced have become more and morecomplex and difficult to use SDN. In such an environment, a networksystem that users can easily access and use is required.In this document we propose a more advanced policy-based networkvirtualization system that allows users to select policies andprovide networks accordingly, rather than a system that simplyvirtualizes a network and shares it with each user.</t>
