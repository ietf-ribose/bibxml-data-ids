    <abstract>
      <t>A BGP path attribute for the purpose of network diagnostics is described. It is non-transitive, such that BGP speakers will not forward it by default. It is structured as a list of elements. An element begins with the BGP identifier and AS number of the speaker that appends the element and includes a list of TLVs. Any speaker can add or remove an element to/from the list. TLVs for a timestamp and for a checksum are described.</t>
