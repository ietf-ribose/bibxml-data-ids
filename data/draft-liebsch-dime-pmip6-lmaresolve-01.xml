      <t>The IETF is specifying Diameter extensions to support mobility service authorization and home network prefix allocation for Proxy Mobile IPv6. The protocol operates between a Local Mobility Anchor and a AAA server. Furthermore, the associated specification extends the existing protocol for network access service to support dynamic assignment and discovery of a Local Mobility Anchor during the authentication procedure. The AAA server maintains mobile nodes' profile in a policy store, which includes information about the assigned Local Mobility Anchor as well as the home network prefix. This document proposes a further extension to allow Local Mobility Anchors benefit from the AAA server's policy store and resolve an unknown mobile node's IP address into a routable address of its assigned Local Mobility Anchor.</t>
