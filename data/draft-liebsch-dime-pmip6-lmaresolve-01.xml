      <t>The IETF is specifying Diameter extensions to support mobilityservice authorization and home network prefix allocation for ProxyMobile IPv6. The protocol operates between a Local Mobility Anchorand a AAA server. Furthermore, the associated specification extendsthe existing protocol for network access service to support dynamicassignment and discovery of a Local Mobility Anchor during theauthentication procedure. The AAA server maintains mobile nodes'profile in a policy store, which includes information about theassigned Local Mobility Anchor as well as the home network prefix.This document proposes a further extension to allow Local MobilityAnchors benefit from the AAA server's policy store and resolve anunknown mobile node's IP address into a routable address of itsassigned Local Mobility Anchor.</t>
