      <t>An IP address serves as a locator and an identifier in the classical Internet environment. This dual role of the IP address makes mobility and multihoming a challenging task. There have been various proposals to overcome this limitation, particularly from the Multi6 working group. This memo makes a comparative analysis of these proposals that support a locator/identifier split for multihoming in IPv6 from the security point of view. The purpose is also to provide a common framework under which future proposals can be compared and chosen for various security requirements.</t>
