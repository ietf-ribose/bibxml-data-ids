      <t>[RFC3315] was not written with the expectation that other stateful DHCPv6 options would be developed. [RFC3633] shoe-horned the new options for Prefix Delegation options for DHCPv6 into DHCPv6. Implementation experience of the CPE model described in [RFC6204] has shown multiple issues with the DHCPv6 protocol in supporting multiple stateful options.</t>
