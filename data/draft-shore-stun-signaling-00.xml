      <t>STUN has proven to be a popular mechanism for providing basic NAT traversal capabilities for UDP traffic. As it has matured it has become an attractive target for extensions that move away from STUN's discovery function towards explicit communication with middleboxes -- in other words, as an on-path signaling protocol. This document describes a more generalized framework for using STUN for solving on- path signaling problems.</t>
