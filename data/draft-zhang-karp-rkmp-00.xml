      <t>When running routing protocols such as BGP or RSVP-TE, two routers need to exchange routing messages in a unicast (one-to-one) fashion. In order to authenticate these messages using symmetric cryptography, a secret key needs to be established. This document defines a Router Key Management Protocol (RKMP) for establishing and managing such keys for routing protocols.</t>
