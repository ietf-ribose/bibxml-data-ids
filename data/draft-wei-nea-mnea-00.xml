      <t>A method for mutual network endpoint assessment is introduced in this document. In current NEA requirements, only the assessment performed by network owner is described. However, for some applications like online business and file sharing, the unilateral assessment is not enough to ensure the two communication parties are both secure Especially in P2P application, the endpoints perform equal responsibility and hence the mutual network endpoint assessment seems more necessary. each endpoint may configure its security assessment policy based on its own security concerns. .</t>
