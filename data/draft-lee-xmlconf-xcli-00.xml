      <t>Currently, there is an ongoing activity in the IETF to define astandard, XML-based protocol to manage the configuration of networksand networking equipments. Defining initial requirements are underwayand one important requirement among them is co-existence with theCLI. This document suggests a possible mechanism for thisrequirement. It identifies some characteristics of CLI commands, andprovides the syntax of XML template which models such characteristicsof CLI commands. X-CLI is an API to manipulate XML templates in aneasy and robust way.</t>
