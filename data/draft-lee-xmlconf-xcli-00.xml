      <t>Currently, there is an ongoing activity in the IETF to define a standard, XML-based protocol to manage the configuration of networks and networking equipments. Defining initial requirements are underway and one important requirement among them is co-existence with the CLI. This document suggests a possible mechanism for this requirement. It identifies some characteristics of CLI commands, and provides the syntax of XML template which models such characteristics of CLI commands. X-CLI is an API to manipulate XML templates in an easy and robust way.</t>
