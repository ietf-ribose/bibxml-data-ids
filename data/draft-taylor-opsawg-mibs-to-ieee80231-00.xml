      <t>This document records the transfer of ownership of a number of MIBs relating to ethernet, from the IETF to IEEE 802.3. Like RFC 4663, it describes the procedures associated with the transfer. Unlike RFC 4663, this documentation is retrospective in nature, since the transfer happened several years ago. Deviations from the planned procedures described in RFC 4663 are noted for historical interest [in a later version of this draft - PTT].</t>
