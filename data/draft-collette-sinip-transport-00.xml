      <t>SIN/IP is a secure, multiplexed transport protocol designed for kernel residency and incremental deployment. It provides authenticated encryption (AEAD), multiplexed streams over a single connection to avoid head-of-line blocking, connection IDs for NAT rebinding and path migration, and pluggable congestion control and pacing. SIN/IP can run as a native IP protocol in controlled networks or be encapsulated in UDP for Internet deployment. This document specifies the wire format, packet and frame layout, connection establishment, packet protection, loss recovery, flow control, congestion control, path management, and connection termination. It also defines IANA registries for SIN/IP parameters and codepoints.</t>
