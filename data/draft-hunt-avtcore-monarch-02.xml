      <t>This memo proposes an architecture for extending RTCP with a new RTCPXR (RFC3611) block type to report new metrics regarding mediatransmission or reception quality, as proposed in RFC5968. This memosuggests that a new block should contain a single metric or a smallnumber of metrics relevant to a single parameter of interest orconcern, rather than containing a number of metrics which attempt toprovide full coverage of all those parameters of concern to aspecific application. Applications may then "mix and match" tocreate a set of blocks which covers their set of concerns. Wherepossible, a specific block should be designed to be re-usable acrossmore than one application, for example, for all of voice, streamingaudio and video.</t>
