      <t>The requirements for MPLS Transport Profile include a requirement (R93) that requires MPLS-TP must support recovery mechanisms for a network constructed from interconnected rings that protect user data that traverses more than one ring. In particular, This includes protecting against cases of failure at the ring-interconnect nodes and links. This document presents different scenario of interconnected rings and special mechanism to address recovery of the failure of ring-interconnect nodes and links. . This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</t>
