      <t>The deployment of large-scale AI services within data centers introduces significant challenges to established technologies, including load balancing and congestion control. Additionally, the adoption of cutting-edge network technologies, such as in-network computing, is on the rise within AI-centric data centers. These advanced network-assisted application acceleration technologies necessitate the flexible exchange of cross-layer interaction information between end-hosts and network nodes. The Application-aware Data Center Network (APDN) leverages the Application-aware Networking (APN) framework for application side to furnish the data center network with detailed application-aware information. This approach facilitates the rapid advancement of network-application co-design technologies. This document delves into the use cases of APDNs and outlines the associated requirements, setting the stage for enhanced performance and efficiency in data center operations tailored to the demands of AI services.</t>
