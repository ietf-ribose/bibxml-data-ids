    <abstract>
      <t>IPv6 packets contain a single unit of transport layer protocol data which becomes the retransmission unit in case of loss. Transport layer protocols including the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and reliable transport protocol users of the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) prepare data units known as segments which the network layer packages into individual IPv6 packets each containing only a single segment. This specification presents new packet constructs termed IPv6 Parcels and Advanced Jumbos (AJs) with different properties. Parcels permit a single packet to include multiple segments as a "packet-of- packets", while AJs offer significant operational advantages over basic jumbograms for transporting singleton segments of all sizes ranging from very small to very large. Parcels and AJs provide essential building blocks for improved performance, efficiency and integrity while encouraging larger Maximum Transmission Units (MTUs) according to both the classic Internetworking link model and a new Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) link model.</t>
