      <t>This document describes a service-identifying label that allows venue-based services that are locally offered by the venue owner to be identified. In particular, we define labels for the most known and common venue services (e.g. mapping and printer). These labels can be used by IEEE 802.11 and service discovery protocols to discover the available services specific to the venue and accessible via the Wireless LAN.</t>
