      <t>This paper provides a framework for a protection scheme in the context of optical channel concatenation (OCC). The need and requirements for optical channel concatenation is addressed in a separate IETF draft, draft-damle-optical-channel-concatenation-00.txt,which has been submitted concurrently. This paper bascially provides mechanisms forfaster failure detection and propagation of failure for concatenatedoptical channels. Standard-based MPLS protection schemes can beemployed for the actual rerouting of traffic utilizing the detection and propagation mechanisms demonstrated in this paper.</t>
