      <t>This draft describes the problem statement and specifies the solution requirements for MIPv4 traversal across VPN or 'NAT and VPN' gateways. The 'NAT and VPN' case refers to a network topology in which the MIPv4 traffic has to traverse one or more NAT gateway(s) followed by a VPN gateway in the path to its final destination. Requirements and problems associated with MIPv4 traversal through NAT gateways NOT involving VPNs is outside the scope of this draft.</t>
