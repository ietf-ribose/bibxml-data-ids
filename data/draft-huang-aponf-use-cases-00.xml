      <t>New services such as virtual network, service function chaining, and application-centric traffic steering bring new opportunities for network providers and service providers. With these new services, the interactions between applications and networks are becoming more critical in order to achieve satisfactory QoS, reliability, and security, which are tailored to each specific application. Application-based Policy for Network Function (APONF) is designed to facilitate these interactions. This internet draft describes some use cases that show how APONF may be deployed to support these services.</t>
