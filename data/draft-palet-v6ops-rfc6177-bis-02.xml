    <abstract>
      <t>The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) policies have different views regarding the recommendation of the prefix to be assigned to end- sites. However, all them allow up to a /48 without further justification and clearly state that the exact choice of how much address space should be assigned to end-sites is a decision of each operator. This document reviews the architectural and operational considerations of end-site assignments, and reiterates that assignment policy and guidelines belong to the RIR community. This revision is being made to emphasize that IPv6 protocol evolution requires an ever-increasing availability of subnets at the end-site, so policy should reflect that assignment of a single subnet is never recommended. This document obsoletes RFC6177 (IPv6 Address Assignment to End Sites).</t>
