      <t>This document specifies a new Hop-by-Hop IPv6 option that is used to record the minimum Path MTU along the forward path between a source host to a destination host. This collects a minimum Path MTU recorded along the path to the destination. The value can then be communicated back to the source using the return Path MTU field in the option. This Hop-by-Hop option is intended to be used in environments like Data Centers and on paths between Data Centers, to allow them to better take advantage of paths able to support a large Path MTU. The method could also be useful in other environments, including the general Internet.</t>
