      <t>One of the concerns with SNMPv2 is its lack of security model extensibility. It is the purpose of this memo, Security Model Extensibility for SNMPv2, to propose possible solutions providing security model extensibility for SNMPv2. It is hoped that these proposals are complementary to and can be integrated with proposals currently under consideration in the SNMPv2 working group.</t>
