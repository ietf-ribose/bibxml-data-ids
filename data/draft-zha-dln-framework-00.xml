      <t>More and more real time applications, such as VR gaming, high frequency trading, Internet of vehicle, require accurate latency guarantee or bound, during service provisioning. Providing End-to- End latency guarantee across Internet is increasingly attractive while challenging. The main problem with latency guarantee on Internet is that packet scheduling is still best-effort, and congestion that further introduces latency uncertainty cannot be avoided. This document presents a way of describing latency information that mostly rely on the congestion management such as queue scheduling, and a framework to use such information to guarantee End-to-End latency.</t>
