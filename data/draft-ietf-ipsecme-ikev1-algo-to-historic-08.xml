    <abstract>
      <t>Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) has been deprecated and its specification in RFC2407, RFC2408 and RFC2409 have been moved to Historic status. A number of old algorithms that are associated with IKEv1, and not widely implemented for IKEv2 are deprecated as well. This document updates RFC 8221 and RFC 8247 and adds a Status column to the IANA IKEv2 Transform Type registries that shows the deprecation status.</t>
