      <t>This document specifies interworking between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and QSIG within corporate telecommunication networks (also known as enterprise networks). SIP is an Internet application- layer control (signalling) protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more participants. These sessions include, in particular, telephone calls. QSIG is a signalling protocol for creating, modifying and terminating circuit-switched calls, in particular telephone calls, within Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). QSIG is specified in a number of ECMA Standards and published also as ISO/IEC standards. As the support of telephony within corporate networks evolves from circuit-switched technology to Internet technology, the two technologies will co-exist in many networks for a period, perhaps several years. Therefore there is a need to be able to establish, modify and terminate sessions involving a participant in the SIP network and a participant in the QSIG network. Such calls are supported by gateways that perform interworking between SIP and QSIG. This document is a product of the authors' activities in ECMA (www.ecma.ch) on interoperability of QSIG with IP networks.</t>
