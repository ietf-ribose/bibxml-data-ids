    <abstract>
      <t>A method is described by which a Device is able to provide location- related measurement data to a LIS within a request for location information. Location-related measurement information are observations concerning properties related to the position of a Device, which could be data about network attachment or about the physical environment. When a LIS generates location information for a Device, information from the Device can improve the accuracy of the location estimate. A basic set of location-related measurements are defined, including common modes of network attachment as well as assisted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters.</t>
