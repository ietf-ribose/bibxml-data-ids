      <t>A method is described by which a Device is able to provide location-related measurement data to a LIS within a request for locationinformation. Location-related measurement information areobservations concerning properties related to the position of aDevice, which could be data about network attachment or about thephysical environment. When a LIS generates location information fora Device, information from the Device can improve the accuracy of thelocation estimate. A basic set of location-related measurements aredefined, including common modes of network attachment as well asassisted Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) parameters.</t>
