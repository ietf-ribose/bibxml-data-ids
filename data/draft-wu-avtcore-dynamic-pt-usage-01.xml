      <t>The RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control (RTP/AVP) is the basis for many other profiles, such as the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP/SAVP), the Extended RTP Profile for Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP)-Based Feedback (RTP/ AVPF), and the Extended Secure RTP Profile for RTCP-Based Feedback (RTP/SAVPF). This document provides guidelines for payload type number usage policy when dynamic payload type allocation is used. Also this document updates closed IANA registry "RTP Payload types (PT) for standard audio and video encodings".</t>
