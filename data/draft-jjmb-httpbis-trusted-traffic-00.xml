    <abstract>
      <t>Current methods for managing traffic through content inspection tend to process all sessions similarly. Internet traffic examples like DDoS mitigation require all data to pass through one of a limited number of scrubbing centers, which create both natural choke points and the potential for widespread collateral damage should a center become overloaded. Similar issues exist with email SPAM and malware filtering, traffic shaping, etc. We propose a method to utilize existing HTTP and HTTPS protocols that enables destinations to temporarily confer trust on sources, and for trusted traffic to be routed and processed differently from untrusted traffic.</t>
