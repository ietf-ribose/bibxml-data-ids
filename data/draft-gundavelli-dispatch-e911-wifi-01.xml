    <abstract>
      <t>This document introduces an approach to enable emergency services over Wi-Fi access networks. These services encompass emergency services such as 911 in North America, 112 in the European Union, and equivalent emergency services in other regulatory domains. The proposed approach aims to provide a comprehensive solution for supporting emergency communication across different regions and regulatory frameworks. Leveraging the legal framework and infrastructure of the OpenRoaming federation, this proposal aims to extend emergency calling capabilities to the vast number of OpenRoaming Wi-Fi hotspots that have already been deployed. The approach addresses critical challenges related to emergency calling, including discovery and authentication procedures for accessing networks that support emergency services, emergency access credentials, the configuration of emergency voice services, accurate location determination of the emergency caller, and call spofing. By providing a comprehensive solution, this proposal ensures that emergency communication services can be seamlessly and effectively supported within the IEEE 802.11-based Wi-Fi ecosystem leveraging Passpoint Profiles.</t>
