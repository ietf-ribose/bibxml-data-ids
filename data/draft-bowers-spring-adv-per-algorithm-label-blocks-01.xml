      <t>Segment routing uses globally-known labels to accomplish destination- based forwarding along shortest paths computed using Dijkstra's algorithm with IGP metrics. This draft discusses how to use segment routing to accomplish destination-based forwarding along paths computed using other algorithms and metrics. In particular, the draft contrasts two different options for associating labels with different algorithms for computing forwarding next-hops.</t>
