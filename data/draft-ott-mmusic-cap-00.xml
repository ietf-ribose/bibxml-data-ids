      <t>This document presents a notation for describing potential and specific configurations of end systems in multiparty collaboration sessions. The objective is to define a configuration description framework that can be used to define end system capabilities, to calculate a set of appropriate common capabilities based on the descriptions of all (end) systems and to express a selected media description for use in session descriptions. One application for this framework would be multiparty multimedia conferencing, an application area where multiple tools have to be configured on conference startup (and/or during the conference) concerning media encoding types and other parameters. Other applications are IP Telephony and media gateway control.</t>
