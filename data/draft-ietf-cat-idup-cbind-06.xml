      <t>The Independent Data Unit Protection Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (IDUP-GSS-API) extends the GSS-API [RFC-1508] for applications requiring protection of a generic data unit (such as a file or message) in a way that is independent of the protection of any other data unit and independent of any concurrent contact with designated 'receivers' of the data unit. Thus, it is suitable for applications such as secure electronic mail where data needs to be protected without any on-line connection with the intended recipient(s) of that data. The protection offered by the IDUP includes data origin authentication with data integrity, data confidentiality with data integrity, and support for non-repudiation services. Subsequent to being protected, the independent data unit can be transferred to the recipient(s) - or to an archive - perhaps to be processed ('unprotected') only days or years later. The Independent Data Unit Protection Generic Security Service Application Program Interface for Signing and Encrypting (IDUP-SE) provides a simplified API for the services of signing and encrypting.</t>
