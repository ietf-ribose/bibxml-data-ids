    <abstract>
      <t>The tremendous growth in Wi-Fi technology adoption over the last decade has met the ultimate possible goal of 100% adoption rate. All most every new mobile device is now equipped with IEEE 802.11-based wireless interface and with pre-configured policy to prefer Wi-Fi to cellular access. Matching this evolution is every service provider's desire to offer Wi-Fi based broadband services; a new business opportunity even for fixed line operators. Operators are exploring options to monetize their existing networks, most with nation-wide footprint, to build a high-speed Wi-Fi service that can be the basis for offering new wireless broadband services. This document identifies the requirements for supporting these new Wi-Fi community services and the mobility tools which have been standardized in IETF that can be used for enabling these architectures.</t>
