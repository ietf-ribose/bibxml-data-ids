      <t>The File Transfer Protocol has a very long history, and despite thefact that today, other options exist to perform file transfers, FTPis still in common use. As such, it is important that in thesituation where some client computers are IPv6-only while manyservers are still IPv4-only and IPv6-to-IPv4 translators are used tobridge that gap, FTP is made to work through these translators asbest it can.FTP has an active and a passive mode, both as original commands thatare IPv4-specific, and as extended, IP version agnostic commands.The only FTP mode that works without changes through an IPv6-to-IPv4translator is extended passive. However, many existing FTP serversdon't support this mode, and some clients don't ask for it. Thisdocument describes server, client and middlebox (if any) behaviorthat minimizes this problem.</t>
