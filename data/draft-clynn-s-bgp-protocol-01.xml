      <t>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is used to distribute routing information between autonomous systems (ASes), is a critical component of the Internet's routing infrastructure. It is highly vulnerable to a variety of malicious attacks both in theory and in practice, due to the lack of a scalable means of verifying the authenticity and legitimacy of BGP control traffic. This document is a protocol specification for Secure BGP (S-BGP), an extension to BGP-4. S-BGP adheres to the principle of least privilege and uses countermeasures that create an authentication and authorization system that addresses most of the security problems associated with BGP. To facilitate adoption and deployment, S-BGP is designed to minimize the overhead (processing, bandwidth, storage) added by its countermeasures and to be interoperable with the current BGP so as to be incrementally deployable.</t>
