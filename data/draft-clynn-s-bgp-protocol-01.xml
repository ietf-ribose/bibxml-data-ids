      <t>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is used to distributerouting information between autonomous systems (ASes), is a criticalcomponent of the Internet's routing infrastructure. It is highlyvulnerable to a variety of malicious attacks both in theory and inpractice, due to the lack of a scalable means of verifying theauthenticity and legitimacy of BGP control traffic. This document isa protocol specification for Secure BGP (S-BGP), an extension toBGP-4. S-BGP adheres to the principle of least privilege and usescountermeasures that create an authentication and authorizationsystem that addresses most of the security problems associated withBGP. To facilitate adoption and deployment, S-BGP is designed tominimize the overhead (processing, bandwidth, storage) added by itscountermeasures and to be interoperable with the current BGP so as tobe incrementally deployable.</t>
