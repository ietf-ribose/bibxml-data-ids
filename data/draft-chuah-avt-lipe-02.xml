    <abstract>
      <t>Several application level multiplexing/compression schemes have been proposed in the IETF Audio/Video Transport (AVT) Working Group [1][2][9] to improve the transport efficiency of packet-voice traffic over IP-based networks. These approaches generally assume voice packets are encapsulated in RTP/UDP/IP by the communicating end- points (e.g., IP phones, mobile terminal, media gateways, etc.). In some transport scenarios, e.g., CDMA/GSM cellular networks, using RTP for voice packet is unnecessary as only the data transfer services provided by the IP/UDP layer, not the media control functions of RTP, are required.</t>
