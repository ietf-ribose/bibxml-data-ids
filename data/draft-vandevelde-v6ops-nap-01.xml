      <t>Although there are many perceived benefits to Network Address Translation (NAT), the primary benefit of "amplifying" available address space is not needed in IPv6. In addition to its many serious disadvantages there is a perception that other benefits exist, such as a variety of management and security reasons that could be useful for an Internet Protocol. IPv6 does not support NAT by design and this document shows how Network Architecture Protection (NAP) using IPv6 can provide the benefits without the need for NAT.</t>
