    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the IKEv2 Link Maximum Atomic Packet and Packet Too Big Extension to limit reassembly operations being performed by the egress security gateway. This extension enables an egress security gateway to notify its ingress counterpart that fragmentation is happening or that the received (and potentially reassembled) ESP packet is too big and thus cannot be decrypted. In both cases, the egress node provides Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) information. Such information enables the ingress node to configure appropriately its Tunnel Maximum Transmission Unit - also designated as MTU or Tunnel MTU (TMTU) - to prevent fragmentation or too big packets to be transmitted.</t>
