      <t>This document specifies the RTP payload format for encapsulating H.263 bitstreams in Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP). The H.263 payload header is designed for flexibility and simplicity. RTP can use one of three possible modes for H.263 video streams depending on the desired performance characteristics. The shortest header mode (Mode A) results in simplicity and easy recovery of lost packets, brought about by fragmentation at Group of Block (GOB) boundaries. The long header modes (Mode B and C) result in more efficient use of bandwidth, brought about by fragmentation at Macroblock (MB) boundaries.</t>
