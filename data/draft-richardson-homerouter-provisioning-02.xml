      <t>This document describes a method to provisioning an 802.1AR-style certificate into a router intended for use in the home. The proceedure results in a certificate which can be validated with a public trust anchor ("WebPKI"), using a name rather than an IP address. This method is focused on home routers, but can in some cases be used by other classes of IoT devices.
