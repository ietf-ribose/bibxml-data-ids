    <abstract>
      <t>The DNS is defined in literally dozens of different RFCs. The terminology used by implementers and developers of DNS protocols, and by operators of DNS systems, has sometimes changed in the decades since the DNS was first defined. This document gives current definitions for many of the terms used in the DNS in a single document. This document will be the successor to RFC 7719. It will update many of the original RFCs. This first draft is essentially the same text as RFC 7719 and is used as a baseline for creating diffs during the document prepration process.</t>
