    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes unknown key-share attacks on the use of Datagram Transport Layer Security for the Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (DTLS-SRTP). Similar attacks are described on the use of DTLS-SRTP with the identity bindings used in Web Real-Time Communications (WebRTC) and SIP identity. These attacks are difficult to mount, but they cause a victim to be mislead about the identity of a communicating peer. Mitigation techniques are defined that implementations of RFC 8122 are encouraged to deploy.</t>
