      <t>This memo defines guidelines and protocol extensions for combining Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based real-time media sessions with Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) based instant messaging and presence services in a seamless manner. This is accomplished by integration and protocol extension support in the endpoints, without requiring any changes in the SIP or XMPP server infrastructure. It is even possible that SIP and XMPP services are offered by different service providers.</t>
