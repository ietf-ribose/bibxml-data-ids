      <t>The deployment of IP Network Address Translators (NATs) for IPv4 hasbecome very pervasive in the last 10-12 years. The original goal ofNAT was to conserve IP address space, but the technology has nowbecome very popular in home and SOHO type networks, as well as manylarger organisations, for a variety of reasons. At the same time,the introduction of NAT adds a cost for application and servicedevelopers. This document presents a brief overview of the historyof NAT, alongside a list of ongoing work related to NAT workaroundsfor current IETF protocol designs. The document intends to present aneutral view of the cost of NAT for discussion in the IETF and widercommunity.</t>
