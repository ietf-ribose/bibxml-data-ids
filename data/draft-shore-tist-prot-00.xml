      <t>TIST is an application of the RSVP protocol to the problem of com-municating application requests, such as pinhole openings and NATtable entries, to NATs and firewalls. By using RSVP we avoid theproblem of having to locate these devices in the network and estab-lish trusted relationships with each one we would like to influ-ence.</t>
