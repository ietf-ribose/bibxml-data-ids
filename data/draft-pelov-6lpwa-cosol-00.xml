    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents a new type of long-range, low-rate radio technologies and an extensible mechanism to operate these networks based on CoAP. The emerging Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWA) present a particular set of constraints, which places them at the intersection of infrastructure networks, ultra-dense networks, delay- tolerant networks and low-power and lossy networks. The main objectives of LPWA signaling is to minimize the number of exchanged messages, minimize the size of each message in a secure and extensible manner, all with keeping the fundamental principle of technology-independence (L2-independence). This document describes the use of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) as the main signaling protocol for LPWA, over which minimal messages are exchanged allowing the full operation of the network, such as authentication, authorization, and management. The use of CoAP signaling provides a generic mechanism that can be applied to different LPWA technologies.</t>
