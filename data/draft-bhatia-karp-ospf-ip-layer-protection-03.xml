      <t>The current OSPFv2 cryptographic authentication mechanism as definedin the OSPF standards is vulnerable to both inter-session and intra-session replay attacks when its uses manual keying. Additionally,the existing cryptographic authentication schemes do not cover the IPheader. This omission can be exploited to carry out various types ofattacks.This draft proposes an authentication scheme based on a challenge-response mechanism that will protect OSPFv2 from both inter and intrareplay attacks when its using manual keys for securing its protocolpackets. For comparison, an approach based on making sequencenumbers unique is presented. Later we also describe some changes inthe cryptographic hash computation so that we eliminate most attacksthat result because of OSPFv2 not protecting the IP header.</t>
