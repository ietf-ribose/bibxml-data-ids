      <t>This document proposes a set of extensions needed to the stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) communication Protocol (PCEP), so as to enable Labeled Switched Path (LSP) scheduling for path computation and LSP setup/deletion based on the actual network resource usage duration of a traffic service in a centralized network environment. A scheduled LSP can be setup at the its starting time and deleted after its usage duration such that LSPs for the other traffic services can take over these network resources beyond that period.</t>
