      <t>This document specifies an extension to MPLS BDI packet to form a newtype of OAM packet BNM(Bidirectional Notify Message) , this BNMpacket will not only have the function of informing another peer MEPabout existing fault of this path like MPLS BDI packet, but also itmay use for performance measure and testing communication between twoequipments. in addtion, when Client network has a fault or defect. itnotify another peer client network about remote peer fault. Andthese performance measure and fault notification information will beencapsulated in BNM packet by the way of TLV packet. So it maydecrease the number of OAM type and keep compatibility with MPLSnetwork. on the other hand, this encapsulating these information bythe way of TLV packet will be easy to extend OAM function to operatean MPLS Transport profile(MPLS-TP) label switched path (LSP).</t>
