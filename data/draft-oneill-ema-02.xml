    <abstract>
      <t>This draft outlines a system for domain-based routing and addressing support in handling edge mobility such as encountered in cellular systems and Internet roaming. The system includes novel features for IP session, address and localised host redirect route management which promise significant scaling benefits compared to other micro-mobility solutions. In addition, the system is closely integrated with the Mobile IP architecture for both signalling and data forwarding, so that a rich set of capabilities and Internet Services are possible, and incremental deployment of EMA is possible within and between AS's. The draft also suggests a specific protocol based on TORA for the implementation of such an architecture. It advocates the creation of a specific IETF working group to address an overall architecture for edge mobility routing, specific extensions to existing routing protocols to accomplish that architecture, and extensions to existing Internet technologies such as Mobile IP to support this architecture.</t>
