    <abstract>
      <t>This draft outlines a system for domain-based routing andaddressing support in handling edge mobility such as encountered incellular systems and Internet roaming. The system includes novelfeatures for IP session, address and localised host redirect routemanagement which promise significant scaling benefits compared toother micro-mobility solutions. In addition, the system is closelyintegrated with the Mobile IP architecture for both signalling anddata forwarding, so that a rich set of capabilities and InternetServices are possible, and incremental deployment of EMA is possiblewithin and between AS's. The draft also suggests a specific protocolbased on TORA for the implementation of such an architecture. Itadvocates the creation of a specific IETF working group to addressan overall architecture for edge mobility routing, specificextensions to existing routing protocols to accomplish thatarchitecture, and extensions to existing Internet technologies suchas Mobile IP to support this architecture.</t>
