      <t>This memo describes an application level protocol for the standardcommunication of e2e QoS compliance information using a protocolbased on Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which forms the basisfor the World Wide Web, and Session Description Protocol (SDP).Quality HTTP (Q-HTTP) provides a mechanism for latency, jitter,bandwidth an packet loss negotiation and monitoring, alertingwhenever one of the negotiated conditions is violated.Implementation details on the actions to be triggered uponreception/detection of QoS alerts exchanged by the protocol are outof scope of this draft, it is application dependant (e.g. increasequality, reduce bit-rate) or even network dependant (e.g. changeconnection's quality profile).</t>
