      <t>This document intents to provide a general and all-round multicast YANG data model, which tries to stand at a high level to take full advantages of existed multicast protocol models to control the multicast network, and guides the deployment of multicast service. And also, there will define several possible RPCs about how to interact between multicast YANG data model and multicast protocol models. This multicast YANG data model is mainly used by the management tools run by the network operators in order to manage, monitor and debug the network resources used to deliver multicast service, as well as gathering some data from the network.</t>
