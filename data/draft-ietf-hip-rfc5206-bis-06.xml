      <t>This document defines mobility extensions to the Host Identity Protocol (HIP). Specifically, this document defines a general "LOCATOR_SET" parameter for HIP messages that allows for a HIP host to notify peers about alternate addresses at which it may be reached. This document also defines elements of procedure for mobility of a HIP host -- the process by which a host dynamically changes the primary locator that it uses to receive packets. While the same LOCATOR_SET parameter can also be used to support end-host multihoming, detailed procedures are out of scope for this document. This document obsoletes RFC 5206.</t>
