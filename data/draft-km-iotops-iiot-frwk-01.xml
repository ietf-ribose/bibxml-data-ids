      <t>Industrial networks are physically separated from the enterprise networks and have been slow to adopt virtualization technologies. Virtualization is necessary to remove the boundaries between the enterprise and process control networks. Virtualization of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) can improve the automation in Industry control networks by simplifying communication between higher-level applications and low-level factory floor machine operations. It provides an opportunity to integrate a diverse set of non-internet protocols supporting Industrial-IoT and IP connections. This document describes the details and benefits of virtualized PLCs and focuses on the problem statement and requirements.</t>
