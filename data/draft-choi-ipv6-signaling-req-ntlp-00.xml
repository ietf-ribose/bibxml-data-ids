      <t>In this draft, we present the features of IPv6 protocol related to NSIS Transport Layer Protocol (NTLP) and requirements for IPv6 signaling as NTLP in different Internet transport infrastructure, such as SDH/SONET switch, Optical cross-connect (OXC), ATM switch, Ethernet switch, wireless system, and router. In this framework, user data is transported via nodes in the data plane and signaling messages are routed to NEs in the control plane. We propose the new protocol, Internet Signaling Message Protocol (ISMP) for carrying signaling messages. And other delivering methods of signaling messages in IPv6 network are also presented in appendix.</t>
