      <t>The intent of this document is to be placed on the RFC track as an Informational RFC. The EDIINT [AS1], [AS2] and [AS3] message formats do not currently contain any provisions for preservation of the filename of a transmitted EDI business document from one Trading Partner to another. However,within certain trading communities, it is not uncommon for Trading Partners to require a specific filenames for EDI business documents to trigger specific backend processing. So it is the goal of this informational document to outline the procedures and mechanisms required to preserve filenames of EDI business documents.</t>
