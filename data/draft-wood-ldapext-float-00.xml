      <t>This draft defines a way that floating point values may be represented as directory (ASCII) strings such that standard ordering rules can be used to sort the strings into the correct collating sequence for their numeric value. The representation is intended for use in X.500 like directories, and has been developed to support mapping of the DMTF Common Information Model.</t>
