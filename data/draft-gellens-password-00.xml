      <t>A number of existing clients and servers currently support the 'poppassd' protocol for changing passwords. This protocol is extremely insecure, as it transmits the user name, current and new passwords in clear text. It also has more round-trips than needed, and lacks an extension mechanism. In addition, it is not possible to specify for which service(s) the password is to be changed. The protocol also traditionally usurps port 106, which is actually assigned for a different purpose.</t>
