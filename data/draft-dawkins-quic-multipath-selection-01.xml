      <t>In QUIC working group discussions about proposals to use multiple paths, an obvious question came up - given multiple paths, how does QUIC select paths to send packets over? The answer to that question may inform decisions in the QUIC working group about the scope of any multipath extensions considered for experimentation and adoption. This document is intended to summarize aspects of path selection from those contributions and conversations. It is recognized that path selection is not the only important open question about QUIC Multipath, but other open questions are out of scope for this document.</t>
