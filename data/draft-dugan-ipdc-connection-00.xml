      <t>The protocol described in this document is a member of the IP Device Control (IPDC) family of protocols. The IPDC protocols are proposed as a protocol suite, components of which can be used individually or together to perform connection control, media control, and signaling transport for environments where the service control logic is separated from the network access server. Please see the references section for other IPDC documents. The protocol specification presented here is intended for use between a media gateway controller and a media gateway. The media gateway may be capable of acting as a voice over IP gateway, voice over ATM gateway, dialup modem media gateway, circuit switch, or cross- connect. Using the IP Connection Control protocol presented here, the media gateway controller can setup, modify and teardown connections within or between media gateways.</t>
