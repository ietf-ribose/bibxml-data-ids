      <t>The IPPM Working Group has developed a one way packet loss metricthat measures the loss rate on a Poisson probe stream between twohosts. However, the impact of packet loss on applications is ingeneral sensitive not just to the average loss rate, but alsoto theway in which packet losses are distributed in loss episodes (i.e.,maximal sets of consecutively lost probe packets). This draftdefines one-way packet loss episode metrics, specifically thefrequency and average duration of loss episodes, and a probingmethodology under which the loss episode metrics are to be measured.</t>
