      <t>This document lays out the problem space of possibly conflicting standards between multiple organizations for URLs and things like them, and proposes some actions to resolve the conflicts. From a user or developer point of view, it makes no sense for there to be a proliferation of definitions of URL nor for there to be a proliferation of incompatible implementations. This shouldn't be a competitive feature. Therefore there is a need for the organizations involved to update and reconcile the various Internet Drafts, Recommendations, and Standards in this area.</t>
