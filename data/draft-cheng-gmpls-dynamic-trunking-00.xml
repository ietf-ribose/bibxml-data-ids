      <t>Currently the GMPLS signaling requires to include a 'LSP Encoding Type' in the Generalized Label Request ([GMPLS-SIG]), which indicates the encoding of the LSP being requested. Upon receiving a RSVP PATH message or CR-LDP REQUEST message that contains a Generalized Label Request, a LSR must verify if the receiving and transmitting interface can support the LSP. In particular on the transmitting side, the node either finds an interface that has the same switching class, among other requirements, or it may use a FA-LSP, i.e., another class of switching.</t>
