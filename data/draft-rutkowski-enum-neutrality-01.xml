      <t>The pursuit by major national Administrations of declared policies of ENUM technical and administrative neutrality among implementations in the marketplace suggest the need for a framework for such neutrality and a focus on interworking among them. [1] [2] This document draws upon the ENUM Working Group archive of discussions as well as public activities in other standards forums and the marketplace to construct an ENUM options framework for facilitating neutrality. This framework includes not only protocol considerations, but also various critical technical and administrative support functions such as authentication and ancillary directory services.</t>
