      <t>Classic Internet transport protocols use a single source IPaddress and a single destination IP address, as part of theidentification for an individual data flow. TCP includes thesein its definition of a connection and its calculation of theheader checksum. Hence the transport service is tied to aparticular IP address pair. This is problematic for multihomedhosts and for mobile hosts. They cannot use more than one, forany single transport association (context). Multiple AddressService for Transport (MAST) defines a mechanism that supportsassociation of multiple IP addresses with any transportassociation. It requires no change to the Internetinfrastructure, no change to IP modules or transport modules inthe end-systems, and no new administrative effort. Instead, itdefines a layer between classic IP and transport that operatesonly in the end systems and affects only participating hosts.Additional functionality is obtained by use of a DNS and'presence' rendezvous service.</t>
