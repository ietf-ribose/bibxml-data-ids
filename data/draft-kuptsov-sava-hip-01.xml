      <t>This document describes an architecture for the source addressvalidation with help of Host Identity Protocol (HIP), SAVAH. Thearchitecture utilizes the properties of cryptographically strongprotocol to authenticate an originator of a network communication.In addition this architecture offers network access control, dataprotection, host mobilty and multihoming features and is suitable forthe wireless networks. The proposed, architecture is the first-hoprouter solution, meaning that it should be deployed on the routerplaced on the edge of a local network topology.</t>
