      <t>This document captures the requirements for the client-facing interface to the security controller. The interfaces are based on user constructs understood by a security admin instead of a vendor or a device specific mechanism requiring deep knowledge of individual products and features. This document identifies the requirements needed to enforce the user-construct oriented policies onto network security functions (NSFs) irrespective of how those functions are realized. The function may be physical or virtual in nature and may be implemented in networking or dedicated appliances.</t>
