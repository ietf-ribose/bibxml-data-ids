      <t>This document is being written because there are a number offirewalls in the Internet that inappropriately reset a TCP connectionupon receiving certain TCP SYN packets, in particular, packets withflags set in the Reserved field of the TCP header. In this documentwe argue that this practice is not conformant with TCP standards, andis an inappropriate overloading of the semantics of the TCP reset.We also consider the longer-term consequences of this and similaractions as obstacles to the evolution of the Internet infrastructure.</t>
