      <t>As telephone services migrate to the Internet, Internet applications require access to diverse information about telephone numbers. ENUM, for example, applied the DNS to the problem of finding URIs for telephone services on the Internet. The intrinsic limitations in the query/response semantics of the DNS, however, have often been strained by the requirements for accessing information about telephone numbers. This document therefore proposes a protocol- independent framework and information model for querying and responding to requests concerning telephone numbers and call routing that allows a richer expression of both questions and answers.</t>
