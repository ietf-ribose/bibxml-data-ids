      <t>Assured Service refers to the set of capabilities used to ensure that mission critical communications are setup and remain connected. [Pierce1] describes the requirements, one of which is to provide preferential treatment to higher priority calls. IEPS refers to a set of capabilities used to provide a higher probability of call completion to emergency calls made by authorized personnel, usually from ordinary telephones. This also requires some form of preferential treatment. This memo describes some of the methods which may be applied to provide that preferential treatment.</t>
