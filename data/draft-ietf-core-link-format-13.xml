      <t>This specification defines Web Linking using a link format for use by constrained web servers to describe hosted resources, their attributes and other relationships between links. Based on the HTTP Link Header field defined in RFC5988, the CoRE Link Format is carried as a payload and is assigned an Internet media type. A well-known URI is defined as a default entry-point for requesting the links hosted by a server.</t>
