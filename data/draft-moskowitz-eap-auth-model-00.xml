      <t>There is considerable confusion surrounding authentication styles and the nature of the resulting trust. This paper is an attempt to develop categories of authentication methods and present examples of each. In so doing, it develops an Authentication Functional Layering Model. It will look at the components of authentication, the flows, channels, algorithms, and entities. The taxonomy presented here is new; it has been created to facilitate discussion and understanding. Only two-party authentications are presented here.</t>
