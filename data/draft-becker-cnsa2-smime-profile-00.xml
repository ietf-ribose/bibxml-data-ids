    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a base profile of S/MIME for use with the U.S. Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) 2.0 Suite, a cybersecurity advisory published by the United States Government which outlines quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithm policy for U.S. national security applications. This profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of U.S. National Security Systems that employ S/MIME. It is also appropriate for all other U.S. Government systems that process high-value information. This profile is made publicly available for use by developers and operators of these and any other system deployments.</t>
