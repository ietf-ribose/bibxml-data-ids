      <t>Fibre Channel (FC) is a high speed serial interface technology that supports several Upper Layer Protocols including Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) and IP. Fibre Channel is standardized by the INCITS T11 Technical Committee. Fibre Channel Standards include Framing and Signaling protocols [FC-FS], Generic Services protocols [FC-GS-3], Switch Fabric protocols [FC-SW-2], etc. The management of a Fibre Channel network requires to monitor and set many parameters related to these protocols and this may be accomplished defining a proper set of MIBs.</t>
