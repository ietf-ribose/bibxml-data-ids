      <t>This document defines techniques for representing two types of information mapping in the OSI Directory: Mapping from a key to a value (or set of values), as might be done in a table lookup, and mapping from a distinguished name to an associated value (or values), where the values are not defined by the owner of the entry. This is achieved by use of a directory subtree. [STANDARDS-TRCK]</t>
