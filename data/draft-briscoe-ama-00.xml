      <t>This paper presents an approach for solving the inherent problem with multicast routing scalability - by co-operation between end-systems and the network. We introduce an extremely efficient, elegant way to name arbitrary sized inter-meshed aggregations of multicast addresses. This is done in such a way that it is easy to calculate how to change the name to encompass many more related names. We describe how these aggregate names could be used anywhere in place of the set of addresses to which they refer, not by resolving them into multiple operations, but by a single bulk action throughout the routing tree, and in session descriptions potentially including those for reservations. Initial aggregation in end-systems might only reduce the problem by an order of magnitude, but it is believed that this will provide sufficient structure for routers to be able to recognise further aggregation potential. To improve the chances of router aggregation, address set allocation schemes must fulfil certain criteria that are laid down in this paper.</t>
