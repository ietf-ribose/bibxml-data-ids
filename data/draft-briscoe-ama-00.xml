      <t>This paper presents an approach for solving the inherent problem withmulticast routing scalability - by co-operation between end-systems andthe network. We introduce an extremely efficient, elegant way to namearbitrary sized inter-meshed aggregations of multicast addresses. Thisis done in such a way that it is easy to calculate how to change thename to encompass many more related names. We describe how theseaggregate names could be used anywhere in place of the set of addressesto which they refer, not by resolving them into multiple operations, butby a single bulk action throughout the routing tree, and in sessiondescriptions potentially including those for reservations. Initialaggregation in end-systems might only reduce the problem by an order ofmagnitude, but it is believed that this will provide sufficientstructure for routers to be able to recognise further aggregationpotential. To improve the chances of router aggregation, address setallocation schemes must fulfil certain criteria that are laid down inthis paper.</t>
