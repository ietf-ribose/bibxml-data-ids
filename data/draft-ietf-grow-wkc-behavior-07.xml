      <t>Well-Known BGP Communities are manipulated differently across various current implementations; resulting in difficulties for operators. Network operators should deploy consistent community handling across their networks while taking the inconsistent behaviors from the various BGP implementations into consideration.. This document recommends specific actions to limit future inconsistency, namely BGP implementors must not create further inconsistencies from this point forward.</t>
