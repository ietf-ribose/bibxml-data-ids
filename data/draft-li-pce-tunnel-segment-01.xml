      <t>[I-D.li-spring-tunnel-segment] introduces a new type of segment, Tunnel Segment, for the segment routing. Tunnel segment can be used to reduce SID stack depth of SR path, span the non-SR domain or provide differentiated services. A binding label can be assigned to tunnel segment. An upstream node can use such a binding label for steering traffic into the appropriate tunnel. This document specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support that PCC reports binding label of tunnel to PCE and that PCE allocates label for tunnel and updates label binding of tunnel to PCC.</t>
