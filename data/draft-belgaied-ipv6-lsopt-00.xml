      <t>This memo describes a new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop Option type used as anexplicit security label. The hosts supporting Labeled Securityadd this option to the packets they originate in order to convey the sensitivity of the data. The routers that recognize thisoption will use it to make routing decision, in conformance with apre-established policy. The IPSec protection requirements and atransition scheme from the existing IPv4 security options to the LSoption are also proposed.</t>
