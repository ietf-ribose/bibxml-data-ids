    <abstract>
      <t>Software-Defined Networking (SDN) can be defined as a new approach for network programmability. Network programmability in this context refers to the capacity to initialize, control, change, and manage network behavior dynamically via open interfaces as opposed to relying on closed-box solutions and their associated proprietary interfaces. SDN emphasizes the role of software in running networks through the introduction of an abstraction for the data forwarding plane and, by doing so, separates it from the control plane. This separation allows faster innovation cycles at both planes as experience has already shown. However, there is increasing confusion as to what exactly SDN is, what is the layer structure in an SDN architecture and how do layers interface with each other. This document addresses these questions and provides a concise reference for SDNRG and the wider SDN community based on relevant peer-reviewed literature, the RFC series, and relevant documents by other standards organizations. This document is a product of the IRTF Software-Defined Networking Research Group (SDNRG)</t>
