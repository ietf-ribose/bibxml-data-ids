      <t>This draft addresses the need for a common, advanced, clientprogramming interface to mainframe host data. Applicationdevelopers, in particular third party application vendors, useAPI's provided by client emulator programs to write applicationsthat access host data. Currently, the defacto standard HLLAPI isthe interface most commonly provided by these programs and the oneused by the third party application vendors. However, HLLAPI isplagued by the fact that it doesn't exploit modern programmingtechniques and is fragmented by multiple, proprietaryimplementations. Client vendors have, over the last couple of years,developed more advanced interfaces that exploit modern programmingadvances. However no effort has been put into standardizing theseinterfaces and application developers have been forced to eitherchose to stay with HLLAPI or perform costly re-implementation oftheir products to support each competing advanced client API.</t>
