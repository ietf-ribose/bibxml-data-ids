      <t>This draft addresses the need for a common, advanced, client programming interface to mainframe host data. Application developers, in particular third party application vendors, use API's provided by client emulator programs to write applications that access host data. Currently, the defacto standard HLLAPI is the interface most commonly provided by these programs and the one used by the third party application vendors. However, HLLAPI is plagued by the fact that it doesn't exploit modern programming techniques and is fragmented by multiple, proprietary implementations. Client vendors have, over the last couple of years, developed more advanced interfaces that exploit modern programming advances. However no effort has been put into standardizing these interfaces and application developers have been forced to either chose to stay with HLLAPI or perform costly re-implementation of their products to support each competing advanced client API.</t>
