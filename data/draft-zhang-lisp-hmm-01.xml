    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes a Hierarchical Mobility Management (HMM) in Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) networks. The Internet is divided into a number of mapping domains (MDs). An Agent Tunnel Router (ATR) as an agent of each MD manages the Mobile Node's EID-to- RLOC mapping. For the movement within the MD, the ATR keeps the EID- to-RLOC mapping invariable, so it avoids the mapping update in the mapping system and the Tunnel Router (TR) of each correspondent node. For the handover between different MDs, to support fast update and handover, a united mapping table is proposed in the ATR.</t>
