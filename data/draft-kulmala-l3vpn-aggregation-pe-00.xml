      <t>This document describes operation of aggregation PE and applications for it. Aggregation PE installs VPN-IPv4 routes into VRFs and acts as BGP next hop when it readvertises VPN-IPv4 routes with MP-BGP to other PE routers. This eliminates the need to LSP connectivity (or some other type of tunnels) between packet's ingress and egress PE.</t>
