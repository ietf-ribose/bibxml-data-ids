      <t>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) was intended for describing multimedia sessions for the purposes of session announcement, session invitation, and other forms of multimedia session initiation. Together with Offer/Answer model it defines a mechanism, how two entities can reach a common view of a multimedia session between them. In certain cases, there are dependencies between media streams, for example a text stream for subtitling make sense only together with a video stream. To avoid senseless connections, the SDP mechanism can be extended with a new Session Description Protocol (SDP) media-level attribute: "dependency". The "dependency" attribute allows the offerer to define dependencies of media streams. The updated offer/ answer mechanism used with new "dependency" attribute can be used furthermore, that in a multi-party SIP session all participants share at least one common media type.</t>
