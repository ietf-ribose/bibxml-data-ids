    <abstract>
      <t>This document offers guidance on incorporating Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) into resource-constrained devices, including IoT devices and lightweight Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), which operate under tight limitations on compute power, memory, storage, and energy. It highlights how the Root of Trust acts as the foundation for secure operations, enabling features such as seed- based key generation to reduce the need for persistent storage, efficient approaches to managing ephemeral keys, and methods for offloading cryptographic tasks in low-resource environments. Additionally, it examines how PQC affects firmware update mechanisms in such constrained systems.</t>
