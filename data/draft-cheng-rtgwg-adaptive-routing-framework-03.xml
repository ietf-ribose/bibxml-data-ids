      <t>In many cases, ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) flow-based hashing leads to high congestion and variable flow completion time. This reduces applications performance. Load balancing based on local link quality is not always optimal, A global view of congestion, with information from remote links, is needed for optimal balancing. Adaptive routing is a technology that makes dynamic routing decision based on changes in traffic load and network topology. This document describes a framework for Adaptive Routing. Specifically, it identifies a set of adaptive routing components, explains their interactions, and exemplifies the workflow mechanism.</t>
