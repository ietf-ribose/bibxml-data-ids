    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a set of metrics for networking services with performance requirements expressed as Service Level Objectives (SLO). These metrics, referred to as Precision Availability Metrics (PAM), can be used to assess the service levels that are being delivered. Specifically, PAM can be used to determine the degree of compliance with which service levels are being delivered relative to pre-defined SLOs. PAM can be used to provide a service according to its SLO as part of accounting records, to account for the actual quality with which services were delivered and whether or not any SLO violations occurred. Also, PAM can be used to continuously monitor the quality with which the service is delivered.</t>
