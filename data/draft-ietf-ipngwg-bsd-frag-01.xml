      <t>There exists a class of applications which cannot accept Path MTU discovery [RFC-1981]. This is recommended to be turned on by default for IPv6 [IPV6-SPEC-V2, 4.5, 5]. This document describes an extension to the BSD API [RFC-2133] to inform the kernel when it should be fragmenting at the network MTU rather than trying to discover the path MTU. Path MTU discovery works well when there is a stream of data. However for distributed servers sending small answers larger than the network MTU to many clients the lack of fragmentation in intermediate nodes is anathema. RFC-1981 Section 5.6 recommends that a system utility be provided to: - Specify that Path MTU Discovery not be done on a given path. - Change the PMTU value associated with a given path. This documents specifies how to do the same at the application level to a individual socket.</t>
