      <t>As the number of mobile terminals increases, Mobile IP[1] potentially could make users roam around the world while also keep their connection to the Internet uninterruptedly. In the mean time, many organizations are using NAPT[2] (Network Address Port Translator) to isolate private network from public realms. The integration of NAPT with Mobile IP, however, introduces technical issues that must be resolved before they can function together. Although techniques such as UDP tunneling[3] and reverse tunneling[4] can be utilized to solve part of the problem, there are still some scenarios which need more discussion. This document reviews these mechanisms and presents a guideline for the integration of Mobile IP and NAPT in various scenarios.</t>
