    <abstract>
      <t>IGP Flexible Algorithm allows IGPs to compute constraint-based paths over the network using different types of metrics or constraints. This document defines a new type of constraint called "Time Constraint", which can be used to control the time period during which a Flex-Algorithm takes effect for constraint-based path calculation. Such mechanism may be useful in network scenarios where either the traffic demand or the characteristics of the network varies as a function of time. The procedures of using Time Constraint in Flexible Algorithm is also described.</t>
