    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies how multiple RTP sessions are to be multiplexed on the same lower-layer transport, e.g. a UDP flow. It discusses various requirements that have been raised and their feasibility, which results in a solution with a certain applicability. A solution is recommended and that solution is provided in more detail, including signalling and examples.</t>
