    <abstract>
      <t>The rapidly growing popularity of IP and its flexibility make it agood candidate to be used for transmission in cellular networks.Using IP-based transport on the wired transmission links in thecellular networks gives operators an opportunity to upgrade theirtransport network to a packet-based one. When compared with atraditional STM-based system, the gain is seen in the statisticalaggregation of traffic that can be done. This results in increasedtransmission efficiency and reduced leasing cost for the operator.</t>
