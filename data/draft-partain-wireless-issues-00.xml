    <abstract>
      <t>The rapidly growing popularity of IP and its flexibility make it a good candidate to be used for transmission in cellular networks. Using IP-based transport on the wired transmission links in the cellular networks gives operators an opportunity to upgrade their transport network to a packet-based one. When compared with a traditional STM-based system, the gain is seen in the statistical aggregation of traffic that can be done. This results in increased transmission efficiency and reduced leasing cost for the operator.</t>
