      <t>For content delivery services that rely upon the IP multicasttransmission scheme, the distribution trees are receiver initiated.The delivery of such services over MPLS networking infrastructuresmay rely upon P2MP LSP tree structures that are sender initiated,with the root of the P2MP tree being at the LSR router directlyconnected to the sender. This document describes a mechanism thataims at establishing MPLS P2MP tree structures that are receiverinitiated. This mechanism builds on the works of Point-to-MultiPointTraffic Engineered Lable Swithched Paths (P2MP-TE LSPs). Thismechanism can also be used to establish receiver driven BiDirectionalP2MP TE LSPs.</t>
