      <t>For content delivery services that rely upon the IP multicast transmission scheme, the distribution trees are receiver initiated. The delivery of such services over MPLS networking infrastructures may rely upon P2MP LSP tree structures that are sender initiated, with the root of the P2MP tree being at the LSR router directly connected to the sender. This document describes a mechanism that aims at establishing MPLS P2MP tree structures that are receiver initiated. This mechanism builds on the works of Point-to-MultiPoint Traffic Engineered Lable Swithched Paths (P2MP-TE LSPs). This mechanism can also be used to establish receiver driven BiDirectional P2MP TE LSPs.</t>
