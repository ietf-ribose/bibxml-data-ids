    <abstract>
      <t>In many deployments, remote attestation is performed within separate administrative and trust domains. Each domain typically operates its own management plane and a Remote Attestation Service (RAS) to obtain verifier inputs (e.g., endorsement material and reference values) and produce attestation results. At scale, cross-domain scenarios face two recurring challenges: (1) enabling policy-controlled transparency so that verifiers or relying parties in one domain can discover and retrieve selected attestation artifacts from other domains; and (2) supporting many-to-many distribution and reuse of verifier inputs and verifier outputs without requiring point-to-point integrations. This document describes Distributed Remote Attestation (DRA) patterns that use a shared publication channel for selected artifacts with provenance and access control in mind. A Distributed Ledger (DL) is discussed as one concrete instantiation of such a publication channel, including an option to host verification logic on the DL. The described patterns are intended to complement existing RATS procedures and conceptual messages, and can be realized by other tamper-evident publication channels with comparable properties.</t>
