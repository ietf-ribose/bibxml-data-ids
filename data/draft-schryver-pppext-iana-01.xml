      <t>The charter of the Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) Extensions working group (pppext) includes the responsibility to "actively advance PPP's most useful extensions to full standard, while defending against further enhancements of questionable value." In support of that charter, the allocation of PPP protocol and other assigned numbers will no longer be "first come first served." This document specifies an Internet Best Current Practices for the Internet Community, and requests discussion and suggestions for improvements.</t>
