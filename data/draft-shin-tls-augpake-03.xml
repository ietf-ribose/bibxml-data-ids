    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an efficient augmented password-authenticated key exchange (AugPAKE) protocol where a user remembers a low-entropy password and its verifier is registered in the intended server. In general, the user password is chosen from a small set of dictionary whose space is within the off-line dictionary attacks. The AugPAKE protocol described here is secure against passive attacks, active attacks and off-line dictionary attacks (on the obtained messages with passive/active attacks), and also provides resistance to server compromise (in the context of augmented PAKE security). Based on the AugPAKE protocol, this document also specifies a new password-only authentication handshake for Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.</t>
