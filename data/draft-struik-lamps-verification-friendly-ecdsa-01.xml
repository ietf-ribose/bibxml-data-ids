    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies how to represent ECDSA signatures so as to facilitate accelerated verification of single signatures and fast batch verification. We demonstrate that this representation technique can be applied retroactively by any device (rather than only by the signer), thereby facilitating transitioning to always generating ECDSA signatures in this way, without changing standardized ECDSA specifications. This facilitates verifying devices to reap the significant speed-up potential (ranging from ~1.3x to more than 2x) fast verification techniques afford.</t>
