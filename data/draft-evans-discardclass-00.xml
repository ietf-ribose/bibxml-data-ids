      <t>Router reported packet loss is the primary signal of when a network is not doing its job. Some packet loss is normal or intended in TCP/ IP networks, however. To minimise network packet loss through automated network operations we need clear and accurate signals of all packets which are dropped and why. This document describes our experience from implementing a packet loss classification scheme to provide these signals and enable automated network mitigation of unintended packet loss.</t>
