    <abstract>
      <t>Flexible Algorithm is a solution that allows some routing protocols (e.g., OSPF and IS-IS) to compute paths over a network based on user- defined (and hence, flexible) constraints and metrics. The computation is performed by routers participating in the specific network in a distributed manner using a Flexible Algorithm Definition. This Definition is provisioned on one or more routers and propagated through the network by OSPF and IS-IS flooding. BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) enables the collection of various topology information from the network. RFC9351 introduced BGP-LS support for the advertisement of Flexible Algorithm Definition as a part of the topology information from the network. This document specifies the advertisement of further Flexible Algorithm related extensions in BGP-LS.</t>
