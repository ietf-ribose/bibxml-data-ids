      <t>This document specifies a new version of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, version 1.4. It is designed to address key challenges that have emerged since the standardization of TLS 1.3, specifically related to the mobility of devices, the need for enhanced 0-RTT security, the integration of post-quantum cryptography, and the refinement of downgrade protection mechanisms. TLS 1.4 introduces a fundamental architectural shift by decoupling the cryptographic session state from the underlying transport-layer connection. This is achieved through a new, transport-agnostic Connection ID (CID). The protocol also provides a new, cryptographically-enforced replay defense for 0-RTT handshakes based on an atomic "read-compare-write" operation on a single-use Session Nonce. A native hybrid post-quantum key exchange framework is integrated into the handshake, offering a robust "safety net" against future cryptanalytic threats. This specification formally obsoletes TLS 1.3 (RFC 8446) and all its related mechanisms. This document updates RFCs 5705, 6066, 7627, and 8422 and obsoletes RFCs 5077, 5246, 6961, 8422, and 8446. This document also specifies new requirements for TLS 1.2 implementations.</t>
