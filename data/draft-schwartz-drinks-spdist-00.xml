      <t>This document defines a protocol for distributing session establishment data from often centralized Session Data Registries or SIP Service Provider data stores into local data repositories for local querying of the data. The distributed data is typically used by various network elements for session peering. This document describes the Session Peering Distribution Protocol (SPDP) that should be seen as an extension to the session peering provisioning protocol defining the provisioning process itself. The document provides a set of guiding principles for the design of this protocol including an extension of the SPPP basic data model for distribution purposes and an associated extension XML Schema Document.</t>
