      <t>Domain Name Registries (DNRs) may operate in special modes for certain periods of time, enabling trademark holders to protect their rights during the introduction of a Top-Level Domain (TLD). One of those special modes of operation is the Sunrise Period. The Sunrise Period allows trademark holders an advance opportunity to register domain names corresponding to their trademarks before names are generally available to the public. This document describes the format of a mark and a digitally signed mark used by trademark holders for registering domain names during the Sunrise Period of generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs). Three types of Mark objects are defined in this specification: registered trademarks, court-validated marks, and marks protected by statue or treaty.</t>
