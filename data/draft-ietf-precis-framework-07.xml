      <t>Application protocols using Unicode code points in protocol strings need to properly prepare such strings in order to perform valid comparison operations (e.g., for purposes of authentication or authorization). This document defines a framework enabling application protocols to perform the preparation and comparison of internationalized strings (a.k.a. "PRECIS") in a way that depends on the properties of Unicode code points and thus is agile with respect to versions of Unicode. As a result, this framework provides a more sustainable approach to the handling of internationalized strings than the previous framework, known as Stringprep (RFC 3454). A specification that reuses this framework can either directly use the PRECIS string classes or subclass the PRECIS string classes as needed. This framework takes an approach similar to the revised internationalized domain names (IDNs) in applications (IDNA) technology (RFC 5890, RFC 5891, RFC 5892, RFC 5893, RFC 5894) and thus adheres to the high-level design goals described in the IAB's recommendations regarding IDNs (RFC 4690), albeit for application technologies other than the Domain Name System (DNS). This document obsoletes RFC 3454.</t>
