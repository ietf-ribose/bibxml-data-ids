    <abstract>
      <t>An IETF Network Slice service provides connectivity coupled with a set of network resource commitments and is expressed in terms of one or more connectivity constructs. A Slice-Flow Aggregate refers to the set of traffic streams from one or more connectivity constructs belonging to one or more IETF Network Slices that are mapped to a set of network resources and provided the same forwarding treatment. The packets associated with a Slice-Flow Aggregate may carry a marking in the packet's network layer header to identify this association and this marking is referred to as Flow-Aggregate Selector (FAS). The FAS is used to map the packet to the associated set of network resources and provide the corresponding forwarding treatment to the packet. MPLS Network Actions (MNA) technologies are used to indicate actions for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) and/or MPLS packets and to transfer data needed for these actions. This document discusses options for using MPLS Network Actions (MNAs) to carry the FAS in MPLS packets.</t>
