      <t>Mapping between X.400 and Internet mail and X.400 routing are normally done using a table-based approach. In practise tables are normal (ASCII) files. In order to function properly tables must be coordinated carefully. One major problem is the lack of automated procedures. This memo - together with it's companion document - proposes one possible solution. This memo discusses the transactions between two nodes, while the companion document discusses the over-all structure aspects. The same solution can be used to transport binary files. This way it is possible to mirror an entire archive with an e-mail only connectivity.</t>
