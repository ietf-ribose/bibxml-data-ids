      <t>Manufacturer Usage Descriptions (MUD) are a means by which devices can establish expectations about how they are intended to behave, and how the network should treat them. Earlier work focused on access control. This draft specifies a means by which manufacturers can express to deployments what form of bandwidth profile devices are expected to have with respect to specific services.</t>
