      <t>This specification clarifies "Capabilities Update" in OPEN statedefined in RFC 3588bis. Capabilities update in OPEN state can reusecommands CER/CEA commands for re-negotiation between Diameter peerswhen one of them changes its capabilities.It is a very importantfunction in Diameter.However, RFC 3588 has defined a mechanism of containing capabilitieslist both in CER and CEA commands and the peer should update itslocal database whenever it receives CER/CEA. This makes the processcomplex and redundant when they are used in OPEN state. So thisdraft proposes a simpler solution based on CER/CEA commands to dealwith this problem.</t>
