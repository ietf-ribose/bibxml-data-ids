      <t>LCONVERT defines extensions to the IMAPv4 Rev1 protocol [RFC3501] for optimization in a mobile setting, aimed at allowing adaptation and transcoding of attachments as needed by the client. Conversion (adaptation, transcoding) may be requested by the client and performed by the server on a best effort basis or decided by the server based on its knowledge of the client capabilities, user or administrator preferences or its settings.</t>
