    <abstract>
      <t>A cryptographically generated address (CGA) is an IPv6 address generated by applying a hash function over the public key of a node and some additional parameters. CGA ownership can be asserted only by the node claiming the address, but is readily verifiable using the public-key of that node by any other entity. Such address authorization is also plausible using symmetric keys, where a node generating the self-identifying address shares a key with the verifier or its agent. This document specifies symmetric-key based address (SBA) generation. The infrastructure support comes with several advantages including proxy-mode operation; the symmetric key usage results in efficient operation; and finally the use of keyed hashing provides security advantages over CGAs.</t>
