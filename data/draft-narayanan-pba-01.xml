      <t>A cryptographically generated address (CGA) is an IPv6 addressgenerated by applying a hash function over the public key of a nodeand some additional parameters. CGA ownership can be asserted onlyby the node claiming the address, but is readily verifiable using thepublic-key of that node by any other entity. Such addressauthorization is also plausible using symmetric keys, where a nodegenerating the self-identifying address shares a key with theverifier or its agent. This document specifies symmetric-key basedaddress (SBA) generation. The infrastructure support comes withseveral advantages including proxy-mode operation; the symmetric keyusage results in efficient operation; and finally the use of keyedhashing provides security advantages over CGAs.</t>
