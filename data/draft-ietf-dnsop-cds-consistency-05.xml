      <t>Maintenance of DNS delegations requires occasional changes of the DS and NS record sets on the parent side of the delegation. For the case of DS records, RFC 7344 provides automation by allowing the child to publish CDS and/or CDNSKEY records holding the prospective DS parameters which the parent can ingest. Similarly, RFC 7477 specifies CSYNC records to indicate a desired update of the delegation's NS (and glue) records. Parent-side entities (e.g. Registries, Registrars) can query these records from the child and, after validation, use them to update the parent-side RRsets of the delegation. This document specifies that when performing such queries, parent- side entities MUST ensure that updates triggered via CDS/CDNSKEY and CSYNC records are consistent across the child's authoritative nameservers, before taking any action based on these records.</t>
