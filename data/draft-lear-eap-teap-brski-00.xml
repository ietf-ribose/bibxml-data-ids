    <abstract>
      <t>In certain environments, in order for a device to establish any layer three communications, it is necessary for that device to be properly credentialed. This is a relatively easy problem to solve when a device is associated with a human being and has both input and display functions. It is less easy when the human, input, and display functions are not present. To address this case, this memo specifies extensions to the Tunnel Extensible Authentication Protocol (TEAP) method that leverages Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures (BRSKI) in order to provide a credential to a device at layer two.</t>
