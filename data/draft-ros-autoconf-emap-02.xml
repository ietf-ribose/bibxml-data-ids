      <t>Mobile Ad Hoc Networks need an auto-configuration protocol being ableto satisfy their self-deployment requirements while remainingflexible enough to accommodate special features for differentdevices.The Extensible Manet Auto-configuration Protocol (EMAP) tries tofullfil these requirements both for IPv4 and IPv6 mobile ad hocnetworks. It provides auto-configuration mechanisms for isolated aswell as hybrid MANETs, and is envisioned to be integrated withinunicast routing protocols (like DYMO [1] or OLSRv2 [2]).EMAP allows nodes to create a (highly likely) unique IP address whichcan be used locally inside the MANET. In a similar way, nodes canauto-configure globally routable IP addresses when one (or more)gateways to the Internet are present in the network. The generalframework provided by the protocol may be used as a service discoveryprotocol for MANETs. As an example, this document also specifies anoptional feature which consists on the discovery of DNS serversreachable from the MANET. However, the approach is extensible toother services like SIP proxies, authentication entities, etc.Therefore, EMAP has been designed taking into consideration thepossibility of extending it later on with new features, uses, andoptimizations.</t>
