      <t>Internet privacy has become an important feature for users of websites and services. This document proposes a way for websites and services to declare and disclose their usage of analytics and tracking software. analytics.txt aims to be an elaborate file format that describes the privacy related characteristics of analytics and tracking software in a non-biased way. An analytics.txt file is understandable for a non-technical audience, while also useful for the automated consumption by tools and software.</t>
