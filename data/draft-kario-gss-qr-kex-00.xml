      <t>This document specifies additions and amendments to RFC4462. It defines a new key exchange method that uses GSS-API in a way to provide key exchange method that is resistant to attacks by quantum computers. The purpose of this specification is to provide an easy- to-implement upgrade to environments that require resistance against quantum computers before widely accepted post-quantum cryptography algorithms are established.</t>
