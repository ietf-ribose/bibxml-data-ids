      <t>One of the key goals of NFV is to optimize the infrastructure resource usage while driving operational simplicity. Real-time analytics providing insight into various components such as compute (e.g. dynamic CPU utilization), storage (e.g. dynamic capacity usage), network (e.g. dynamic bandwidth utilization), energy (e.g. dynamic power consumption) is key to not only providing visibility into the NFV infrastructure and thus driving operational simplicity but also optimizing resource usage for the purposes of orchestration. This draft focusses on use cases and architectural framework for real-time analytics and orchestration including Big Data predictive analytics for addressing the aforementioned requirements.</t>
