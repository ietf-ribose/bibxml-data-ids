      <t>With bidirectional tunneling in Proxy Mobile IPv6, the communicationbetween any two Mobile Nodes is required to traverse the LocalMobility Anchor (LMA). This is the case even when the communicatingMobile Nodes are attached to the same Mobility Anchor Gateway (MAG).This document introduces two messages between the LMA and the MAGenabling local forwarding by the MAG. Such forwarding avoids thedelay due to bidirectional forwarding, and reduces the traffic loadon the LMA.</t>
