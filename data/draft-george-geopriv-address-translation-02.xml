      <t>This document explains how to map a geodetic datum to a civic address and vice versa. Server accepts an HTTP POST with one form of user specified location addresses and return whatever other form it has. [Open Issue : re-frame this draft as more about the inclusion of a &lt;presence&gt; element in a HELD request, rather than about geocoding specifically, since there are other applications. E.g., we might provide a rough location in our request to help the server provide us with GPS assistance data.]</t>
