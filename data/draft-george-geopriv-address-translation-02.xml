      <t>This document explains how to map a geodetic datum to a civic addressand vice versa. Server accepts an HTTP POST with one form of userspecified location addresses and return whatever other form it has.[Open Issue : re-frame this draft as more about the inclusion of a&lt;presence&gt; element in a HELD request, rather than about geocodingspecifically, since there are other applications. E.g., we mightprovide a rough location in our request to help the server provide uswith GPS assistance data.]</t>
