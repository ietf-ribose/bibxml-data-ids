      <t>The memo lists operational requirements for IPv6 SMTP, and IPv6-capable MX DNS records. As we deploy IPv6 SMTP servers, it became apparent that we need certain configuration in IPv6-capable MX DNS record, for stable dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) SMTP operations. The document tries to clarify the problems we have in transition period between IPv4 SMTP and IPv6 SMTP, and operational requirements for stable IPv4/v6 SMTP operation.</t>
