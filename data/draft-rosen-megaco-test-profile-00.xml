      <t>This document describes a profile for use in interoperability testing of the Megaco/H.248 protocol and a set of scenarios to try increasingly difficult mechanisms in the protocol. To support early phase testing, it is useful to define a simple, easy to implement set of characteristics that allow initial implementations to get very basic functions working. By implementing this profile, testing a variety of MGs against a variety of MGCs is possible. The test scenarios describe high-level behavior expected by the MGs and MGCs, but not explicit message sequences. Also included is a set of test messages that may be used to verify early stage MG/MGC functionality. They could be used to test parsers, and they can be used to assure that implementations have base functionality prior to testing with devices that may not produce the same messages.</t>
