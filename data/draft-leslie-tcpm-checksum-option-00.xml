      <t>There are a number of situations in TCP where middleboxes are known to change TCP-layer data; and it would be helpful for endpoints to detect such changes. TCP-Checksum is a TCP option to pass checksums over particular fields from sender to receiver, which can detect such changes by legacy middleboxes. This document also sets a rule for future middleboxes which insist upon modifying these checksums.</t>
