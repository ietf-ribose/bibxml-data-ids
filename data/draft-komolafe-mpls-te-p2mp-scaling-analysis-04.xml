      <t>Traffic engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE) isdeployed in providers' core networks, and the scaling propertieshave been analyzed to show how much control state must be maintainedto support a full mesh of edge-to-edge point-to-point (P2P) LabelSwitched Paths (LSPs) in various network topologies and with severaldifferent scaling techniques.Point-to-multipoint (P2MP) MPLS-TE LSPs are very interesting toservice providers as a means to provide multicast services (such asTV distribution, or multicast VPN connectivity) across core MPLSnetworks. P2MP LSPs have different scaling properties than P2P LSPs,and service providers need to understand whether existing protocolsand implementations can support the network sizes and service levelsthat they are planning in their P2MP MPLS-TE networks.This document presents an analysis of the scaling properties MPLS-TEcore networks that support P2MP LSPs.</t>
