      <t>This document proposes a new mechanism called 'Connection/Link StatusInvestigation (CSI)'. It is designed to collect status information ofnodes along the communication path. One new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop option(CSI option) and three new ICMPv6 messages (Status Request/Reply, andStatus Report) are proposed as extensions for the CSI mechanism.The CSI mechanism is based on hop-by-hop data acquisition operationsand realtime 'boomerang' action messages. It is simple and caninvestigate both outgoing and incoming paths between the source andthe destination with minimum investigation packets.It can provide various new functions (e.g. realtime consumedbandwidth measurement, etc.). Since it has good characteristics, itis possible to innovate current investigation functions (e.g.,'traceroute', 'pathchar', etc.)This document describes specifications of the CSI mechanism anddefines a set of basic data types. The CSI mechanism is designed as ageneric framework mechanism. By defining new data types to collect,it can be easily applied to various advanced usages.</t>
