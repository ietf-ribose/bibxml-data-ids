    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a new mechanism called 'Connection/Link Status Investigation (CSI)'. It is designed to collect status information of nodes along the communication path. One new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop option (CSI option) and three new ICMPv6 messages (Status Request/Reply, and Status Report) are proposed as extensions for the CSI mechanism. The CSI mechanism is based on hop-by-hop data acquisition operations and realtime 'boomerang' action messages. It is simple and can investigate both outgoing and incoming paths between the source and the destination with minimum investigation packets. It can provide various new functions (e.g. realtime consumed bandwidth measurement, etc.). Since it has good characteristics, it is possible to innovate current investigation functions (e.g., 'traceroute', 'pathchar', etc.) This document describes specifications of the CSI mechanism and defines a set of basic data types. The CSI mechanism is designed as a generic framework mechanism. By defining new data types to collect, it can be easily applied to various advanced usages.</t>
