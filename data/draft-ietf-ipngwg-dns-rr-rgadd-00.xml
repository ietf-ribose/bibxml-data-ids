      <t>This document is a proposal to redefine the existing DNS AAAA resource record into two resource records: an RG record to define the routing topology of an IPv6 address and an aAA record to define the End System Identifier of an IPv6 address. The document will define the synthesis of the RG and aAA record at the DNS primary server, which will return an AAAA record to DNS resolvers. The objective of this work is to split the AAAA record in the DNS into location and identifier to provide future capabilities for dynamic renumbering of addresses. This work was spawned by the GSE - Alternate Addressing Architecture Proposal for IPv6.</t>
