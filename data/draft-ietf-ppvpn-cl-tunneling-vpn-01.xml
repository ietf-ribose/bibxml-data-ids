      <t>This document describes a connectionless tunneling architecture thatis applicable to layer 3 PE-based virtual private networks andspecifies protocols for implementing it. This tunneling architectureis designed to facilitate scalability and reliability. A prominentfeature of it is to provide VPN tunnels over a connectionlessnetwork. Since a connectionless network can provide full meshconnectivity without a connection establishment procedure, thearchitecture enables scalable operation of a VPN more efficientlythan connection-oriented tunneling technologies.</t>
