      <t>In an IPv6 home network, there is a possibility that the residential gateway, learns a different IPv6 prefix after each dial-up; attempts to communicate using old address would thus fail. This implies that we should not attempt to trigger dial-up by simply sending the first packet of a connection.</t>
