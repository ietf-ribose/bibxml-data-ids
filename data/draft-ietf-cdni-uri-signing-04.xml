      <t>This document describes how the concept of URI signing supports the content access control requirements of CDNI and proposes a URI signing scheme. The proposed URI signing method specifies the information needed to be included in the URI and the algorithm used to authorize and to validate access requests for the content referenced by the URI. The algorithm includes specific provisions for allowing access control of HTTP Adaptive Streaming content that is characterized by independent chunks referenced by a manifest file. The proposed mechanism is also applicable in a non-CDNI context.</t>
