      <t>There are situations where it is desirable to determine whether twoURIs are identical without revealing the value of one or the other ifthey are not. For example, the publisher of filtering software may wantto provide a set of URLs to be filtered without identifying the actualresources in question.This problem has traditionally been done using cryptographicallysecure hashes. The two items are both hashed and the resulting valuesthen compared. If they are equal it can be assumed that the two originalitems were equal as well; if not, the hash does not reveal anythingabout the original item. This technique is eminently suitable for thissituation.This document describes a 'hashed' URI naming scheme for representingthe hashed form of a URI [RFC2396] as another URI.</t>
