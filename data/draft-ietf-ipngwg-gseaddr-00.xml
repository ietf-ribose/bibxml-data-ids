    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents an alternative addressing architecture for IPv6 which controls global routing growth by very aggressive topological aggregation. It includes support for scalable multi-homing as a distinguished service. It provides for future independent evolution of routing and forwarding models with essentially no impact on end systems. Finally, it frees sites and service resellers from the tyranny of CIDR-based aggregation by providing transparent re-homing of both.</t>
