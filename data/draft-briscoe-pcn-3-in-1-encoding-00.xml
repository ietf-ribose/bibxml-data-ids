      <t>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a mechanism designed to protectthe quality of service of inelastic flows. It does this by markingpackets when traffic load on a link is approaching or has exceeded athreshold below the physical link rate. This document specifies anextension to the two-state PCN baseline encoding that enables threeencoding states to be carried in the IP header without using morethan one Diffserv codepoint. It presupposes a standards action hasremoved the limit of two encoding states in current tunnellingmechanisms.</t>
