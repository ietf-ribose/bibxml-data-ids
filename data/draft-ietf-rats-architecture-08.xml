    <abstract>
      <t>In network protocol exchanges it is often the case that one entity requires believable evidence about the operational state of a remote peer. Such evidence is typically conveyed as claims about the peer's software and hardware platform, and is subsequently appraised in order to assess the peer's trustworthiness. The process of generating and appraising this kind of evidence is known as remote attestation. This document describes an architecture for remote attestation procedures that generate, convey, and appraise evidence about a peer's operational state.</t>
