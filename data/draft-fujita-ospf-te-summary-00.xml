    <abstract>
      <t>Various Traffic Engineering extensions for OSPF have been proposed in [KATZ, OSPFEXT] and others. However, these are basically applicable only to intra-area Traffic Engineering since they do not support inter-area advertisements of the resource information. This draft proposes a new scheme for advertising the summarized resource information for Traffic Engineering outside the area. It also specifies a new LSA to achieve this advertisement.</t>
