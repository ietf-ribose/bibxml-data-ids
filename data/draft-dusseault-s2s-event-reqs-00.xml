      <t>Server-to-server event pipelines are required in situations where an event source generates events for a number of end-users (or simply generates events without an idea of who the end recipients might be), and sends these events to an event or notification aggregator service. These kinds of event source servers are common in messaging (for example, voice messaging servers and calendar servers might send events to a user's main messaging server or to a single-purpose notification server). A general set of requirements is outlined here for the server-to-server aspect of these kinds of scenarios.</t>
