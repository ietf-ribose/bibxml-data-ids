      <t>Server-to-server event pipelines are required in situations where anevent source generates events for a number of end-users (or simplygenerates events without an idea of who the end recipients might be),and sends these events to an event or notification aggregatorservice. These kinds of event source servers are common in messaging(for example, voice messaging servers and calendar servers might sendevents to a user's main messaging server or to a single-purposenotification server). A general set of requirements is outlined herefor the server-to-server aspect of these kinds of scenarios.</t>
