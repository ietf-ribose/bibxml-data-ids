      <t>RFC 3552 introduces a threat model that does not include endpoint security. RFC 3552 is 15 years old and in those 15 years the threat landscape has changed. Security issues and cyber attacks have increased and there are more devices, users, and applications on the endpoint than ever. This draft proposes a new approach to the Internet threat model which will include endpoint security, focus on users and provide an update to the threat model in RC 3552.</t>
