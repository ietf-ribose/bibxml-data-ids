      <t>This document describes a Transport Model for the Simple NetworkManagement Protocol (SNMP), that uses either the Transport LayerSecurity protocol or the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)protocol. The TLS and DTLS protocols provide authentication andprivacy services for SNMP applications. This document describes howthe TLS Transport Model (TLSTM) implements the needed features of aSNMP Transport Subsystem to make this protection possible in aninteroperable way.This transport model is designed to meet the security and operationalneeds of network administrators. The TLS mode can make use of TCP'simproved support for larger packet sizes and the DTLS mode providespotentially superior operation in environments where a connectionless(e.g. UDP or SCTP) transport is preferred. Both TLS and DTLSintegrate well into existing public keying infrastructures.This document also defines a portion of the Management InformationBase (MIB) for monitoring and managing the TLS Transport Model forSNMP.</t>
