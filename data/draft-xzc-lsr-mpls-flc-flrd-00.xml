      <t>Flow-ID Label (FL) is used for MPLS flow identification and flow- based performance measurement with alternate marking method. The ability to process Flow-ID labels is called Flow-ID Label Capability (FLC), and the capability of reading the maximum label stack depth and performing FL-based performance measurement is called Flow-ID Readable Label Depth (FRLD). This document defines a mechanism to signal the FLC and the FRLD using IGP and BGP-LS.</t>
