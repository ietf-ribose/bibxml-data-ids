      <t>This memo lists the security issues not addressed by SIPS and other drafts in progress. It provides two solutions to it. First solution calls for fixing issues one by one. The second solution avoids the security issues altogether. It has potential to obviate the need of 'Security Consideration' section from IETF documents. It requires wider acceptance from the community. Author is requesting IETF community to voice it's opinion and share the second solution with non-IETF members also to have their opinion.</t>
