      <t>One very popular use of VPNs is to provide telecommuter access to the corporate Intranet. Remote clients that are behind NAT boxes can also access the corporate intranet with the help of thestandard NAT Traversal feature.But this access may be disturbed in scenarios where a mobile userroams across different points of attachment and there by gettingassigned with different IP Addresses. The access also fails in cases where the client roams across environments with NATto environments without NAT and vice versa. In both the cases the tunnel may get re-established but it induces jitter in voicesessions.</t>
