      <t>The HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2068) is silent about various details of TCP connection management when using persistent connections. This document discusses some of the implementation issues discussed during HTTP/1.1's design, and introduces a few new requirements on HTTP/1.1 implementations learned from implementation experience, not fully understood when RFC 2068 was issued. This is an initial draft for working group comment, and we expect further drafts.</t>
