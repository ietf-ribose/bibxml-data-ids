      <t>This draft addresses security aspects pertaining to Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPNs). We first describe the security threats that are relevant in the context of PPVPNs, and the defensive techniques that can be used to combat those threats. We consider security issues deriving both from malicious behavior of anyone and from negligent or incorrect behavior of the providers. We also describe how these security attacks should be detected and reported. We then discuss the possible user requirements in terms of security in a PPVPN service. These user requirements translate into corresponding requirements for the providers. In addition, the provider may have additional requirements to make its network infrastructure secure and meet the VPN customerâ€™s expectations. Finally, we define how these user requirements apply to specific PPVPN technologies, namely RFC2547 PPVPNs, Virtual Router PPVPNs, IPSec VPNs, and Layer 2 PPVPNs.</t>
