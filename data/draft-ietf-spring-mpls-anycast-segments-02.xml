    <abstract>
      <t>Instead of forwarding to a specific device or to all devices in a group, anycast addresses, let network devices forward a packet to (or steer it through) one or more topologically nearest devices in a specific group of network devices. The use of anycast addresses has been extended to the Segment Routing (SR) network, wherein a group of SR-capable devices can represent a anycast address, by having the same Segment Routing Global Block (SRGB) provisioned on all the devices and each one of them advertising the same anycast prefix segment (or Anycast SID). This document describes a proposal for implementing anycast prefix segments in a MPLS-based SR network, without the need to have the same SRGB block (label ranges) provisioned across all the member devices in the group. Each node can be provisioned with a separate SRGB from the label range supported by the specfic hardware platform.</t>
