      <t>This memo describes a generalized approach for achieving IP fastrestoration in response to link and router failures by using IProuting to support high network availability. The approach relieson the utilization of flat, yet highly-localized routing technologyto reduce far-reaching control message propagation, thereby limitingthe effects of a failure and enabling sub-second restoration. Itthen outlines how the Temporally-Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) (aMobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) routing protocol), when suitablymodified for use in fixed networks, can be used within thisframework. The general approach to routing topology managementwithin the fast restoration framework is immediate reaction on linkfailure (to preserve existing flows) and gradually integration ofnew network elements on activation into the domain (to furtherassure stability).</t>
