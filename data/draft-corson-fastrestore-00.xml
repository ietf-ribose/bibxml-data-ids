      <t>This memo describes a generalized approach for achieving IP fast restoration in response to link and router failures by using IP routing to support high network availability. The approach relies on the utilization of flat, yet highly-localized routing technology to reduce far-reaching control message propagation, thereby limiting the effects of a failure and enabling sub-second restoration. It then outlines how the Temporally-Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) (a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) routing protocol), when suitably modified for use in fixed networks, can be used within this framework. The general approach to routing topology management within the fast restoration framework is immediate reaction on link failure (to preserve existing flows) and gradually integration of new network elements on activation into the domain (to further assure stability).</t>
