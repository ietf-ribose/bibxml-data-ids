      <t>The Incident Object Description Exchange Format (IODEF) is an XML data representation framework for sharing information about computer security incidents. In IODEF, the Reference class provides references to externally specified information such as a vulnerability, IDS alert, malware sample, advisory, or attack technique. In practice, these references are based on external enumeration specifications that define both the enumeration format and the specific enumeration values, but the IODEF Reference class (as specified in RFC 5070) does not indicate how to include both of these important pieces of information. This memo provides an extension to RFC 5070 to include both the external specification and specific enumeration value in the IODEF Reference class. This memo also establishes an IANA registry to manage external enumeration specifications for use by IODEF.</t>
