      <t>This document summarizes the various issues associated with implementing IP multicast over ATM subnets and wide-area networks. The reader is assumed to have read the Internet Draft 'IP over ATM: A Framework Document' &lt;draft-ietf-atm-framework-doc-01.txt&gt; [1], which classifies various types of ATM subnet and end-to-end models, and also describes proposals for IP operation over those models. The terminology and various network models discussed here are drawn primarily from that document, and the reader is assumed to be familiar with them.</t>
