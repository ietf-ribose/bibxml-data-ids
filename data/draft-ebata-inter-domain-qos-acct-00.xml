      <t>Recently, IETF has started to examine policy as a tool for managing and controlling the provision of QoS guaranteed services. In a multi-domain environment, each domain will define its own policies and manage the services according to its own policies. So it is natural that the policy in one domain is different from the policy in another domain. Therefore, this document focuses on the policy setup required for supporting inter-domain QoS provisioning and accounting and describes the policy exchange required between the domains. For supporting the policy exchanges, this document describes two protocols, namely 'Policy Advertisement Protocol (PAP)' and 'Policy Negotiation and Notification Protocol (PNP)'. PAP is used by a domain to advertise its service policies to other domains. PNP is used by a domain to request another domain to provide a QoS guaranteed service and for the requested domain to notify the requesting domain of the policies governing the charges for the services. This allows dynamic negotiation for the service charges based on the offered QoS.</t>
