      <t>This memo describes a Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) payloadformat for the MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) commandlanguage. The format encodes all commands that may legally appear ona MIDI 1.0 DIN cable. The format is suitable for interactiveapplications (such as network musical performance) and content-delivery applications (such as file streaming). The format may beused over unicast and multicast UDP and TCP, and it defines tools forgraceful recovery from packet loss. Stream behavior, including theMIDI rendering method, may be customized during session setup. Theformat also serves as a mode for the mpeg4-generic format, to supportthe MPEG 4 Audio Object Types for General MIDI, Downloadable SoundsLevel 2, and Structured Audio.</t>
