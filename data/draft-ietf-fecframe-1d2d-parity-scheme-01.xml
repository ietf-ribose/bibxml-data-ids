      <t>This document defines new RTP payload formats for the Forward ErrorCorrection (FEC) that is generated by the non-interleaved andinterleaved parity codes from a source media encapsulated in RTP.These parity codes are systematic codes, where a number of repairsymbols are generated from a set of source symbols and sent in arepair flow separate from the source flow that carries the sourcesymbols. The non-interleaved and interleaved parity codes offer agood protection against random and bursty packet losses,respectively, at a cost of decent complexity. The RTP payloadformats that are defined in this document address the scalabilityissues experienced with the earlier specifications including RFC2733, RFC 5109 and SMPTE 2022-1, and offer several improvements. Dueto these changes, the new payload formats are not backward compatiblewith the earlier specifications.</t>
