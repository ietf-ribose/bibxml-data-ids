      <t>In mobile networks, the Mobile Router (MR) is an operational main entity. With multiple MRs, mobile networks can provide the stability of service. And, there already exist various multi-homing scenarios. However, because of mobility and MR-HA relations, there are several security problems in multi-homed mobile networks. In this draft, we identify threats to multi-homed mobile networks. And we will illustrate several scenarios of Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, Redirection attacks, and Replay attacks.</t>
