      <t>End-to-end provisioning of quality of service guarantees is nowadays one of the most basic and crucial issues. Towards this end, the inter-domain resource control architecture for DiffServ networks described in [1], tries to address this issue by applying a scalable and efficient signaling approach. Based on this architecture, this paper tries to provide an analysis and a performance study of the introduced quiet grafting mechanisms.</t>
