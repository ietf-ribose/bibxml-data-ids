      <t>This memo describes 8+8 address format, which is an IPv6 addressformat with locator/ID separation useful for end to end multihoming.A 16 byte address of an end is separated into two 8 byte fields:locator, which is used to route packets to a link to which the end isattached, and ID, which is used to globally identify the end.Locators are assigned from (top level) ISPs to sites (and lower levelISPs) in hierarchical and aggregatable manner that a multihomed site(and ISPs) receive multiple locators from upstream ISPs.A usual host in a multihomed site (or a singly homed site under amultihomed ISP) is expected to have an ID and multiple locators andtransport layer protocols are expected to handle multiple locators ofthe host and its peer.</t>
