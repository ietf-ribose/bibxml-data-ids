      <t>This memo describes 8+8 address format, which is an IPv6 address format with locator/ID separation useful for end to end multihoming. A 16 byte address of an end is separated into two 8 byte fields: locator, which is used to route packets to a link to which the end is attached, and ID, which is used to globally identify the end. Locators are assigned from (top level) ISPs to sites (and lower level ISPs) in hierarchical and aggregatable manner that a multihomed site (and ISPs) receive multiple locators from upstream ISPs. A usual host in a multihomed site (or a singly homed site under a multihomed ISP) is expected to have an ID and multiple locators and transport layer protocols are expected to handle multiple locators of the host and its peer.</t>
