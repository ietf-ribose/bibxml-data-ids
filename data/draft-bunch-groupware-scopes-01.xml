      <t>The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework is widely used to provide clients with delegated access to user data. However, the core specification leaves the definition of access scopes to individual service providers. This has led to a fragmented ecosystem for common groupware services (Mail, Calendaring, Contacts), where each provider uses proprietary, non-interoperable scope identifiers. Client applications, such as desktop mail clients, are forced to hardcode configurations for a small number of large providers, stifling innovation and harming open ecosystems. This document proposes a framework that combines a minimal set of standardized OAuth 2.0 scopes with a detailed structure for use with OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests (RAR). This hybrid approach provides a simple baseline for legacy clients while enabling powerful, granular, and privacy-preserving authorization for modern clients. It defines RAR type values, actions, datatypes, and custom fields for specifying fine-grained permissions for groupware resources.</t>
