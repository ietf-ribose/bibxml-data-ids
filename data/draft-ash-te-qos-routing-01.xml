      <t>The draft describes, analyzes, and recommends traffic engineering (TE) methods which control a network's response to traffic demands and other stimuli, such as link failures or node failures. These TE methods include: *traffic management through control of routing functions, which include call routing (number/name translation to routing address), connection routing, QoS resource management, routing table management, and dynamic transport routing. *capacity management through control of network design. *TE operational requirements for traffic management and capacity management, including forecasting, performance monitoring, and short-term network adjustment. These TE methods are recommended for application across network types based on established practice and experience.</t>
