      <t>This document is a summary of the work of the ACE design team of the Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) Working Group. If the IDN WG selects a single ACE, the design team suggests DUDE. There are many factors that the IDN WG might consider that may lead it to choose a different ACE; those factors and proposals that some of the design team members favored are also described in this document.</t>
