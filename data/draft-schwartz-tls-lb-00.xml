      <t>A load balancer that does not terminate TLS may wish to provide some information to the backend server, in addition to forwarding TLS data. This draft proposes a protocol between load balancers and backends that enables secure, efficient delivery of TLS with additional information. The need for such a protocol has recently become apparent in the context of split mode ESNI.</t>
