      <t>The purpose of the TN3287 protocol is to provide a general, bi-directional printer communications facility. It's primary goal is to allow a standard method of interfacing printer devices and printer-oriented processes to each other. This protocol will allow a TN3270 Client to process 3287 print data streams. This RFC supplements and extends the RFC 854, TELNET Protocol Specification. This RFC also presents an example of the correct implementation.</t>
