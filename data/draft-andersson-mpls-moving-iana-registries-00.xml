      <t>When RFC 6374 "Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS Networks" were developed, the code points allocated by this RFC were mistakenly placed within the Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) Ping Parameter registry. This document creates a new dedicated name space for Generic Associated Channel code points and move them to a name space their own.</t>
