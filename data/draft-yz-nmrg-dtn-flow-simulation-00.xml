      <t>Some important application scenarios of digital twin network, such as network new technology experiment, network configuration verification, network performance optimization, etc., all require the virtual traffic in the twin network to accurately simulate the real traffic in the physical network.The real traffic in the physical network is called the physical traffic, and the virtual traffic in the twin network is called the twin traffic. In order to realize the high-fidelity simulation of the physical traffic by the twin traffic, this paper proposes that the twin traffic and the physical traffic should satisfy three consistent characteristics, and An implementation method of twin flow is introduced.</t>
