      <t>Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) service aims to provide distributed applications with information to perform better-than- random initial peer selection when multiple peers in the network are available to provide a resource or service. In order to discover an Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Server, a set of mechanisms are required. These mechanisms enable applications to find an information source which provides them with information regarding the underlying network. This document discusses various scenarios of ALTO discovery and specifies the use of several available options such as DHCP or DNS.</t>
