    <abstract>
      <t>This document studies the relationships of WebRTC communication users with their web Calling Services (CS) and their Identity Providers (IdPs), in order to identify requirements for IdP based peer-to-peer authentication. This study focuses in particular on issues of privacy, security and trust that are raised by the introduction of the IdP into the WebRTC call model, and by a different browser-based calling paradigm, compared with Mobile networks or traditional VoIP systems. The document lists privacy and trust scenarios for WebRTC authentication for individuals as well as organizations. This contribution is proposed to the RTCWEB working group.</t>
