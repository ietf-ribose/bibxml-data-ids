    <abstract>
      <t>Network virtualization technique leveraged by a virtual machine makes it possible to dynamically relocate functional entities without topological and physical constraints. By tapping into this technique, service mobility, which deals with not only functional entities but also sessions established between those entities, will become possible and such capability is especially longed for realizing more scalable and reliable telecom networks. This document provides the reference model for service mobility in a virtual environment and defines the control protocol between the virtualized platform and the managing controller to realize service mobility.</t>
