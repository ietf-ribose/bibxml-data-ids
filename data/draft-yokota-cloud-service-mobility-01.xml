      <t>Network virtualization technique leveraged by a virtual machine makesit possible to dynamically relocate functional entities withouttopological and physical constraints. By tapping into thistechnique, service mobility, which deals with not only functionalentities but also sessions established between those entities, willbecome possible and such capability is especially longed forrealizing more scalable and reliable telecom networks. This documentprovides the reference model for service mobility in a virtualenvironment and defines the control protocol between the virtualizedplatform and the managing controller to realize service mobility.</t>
