      <t>This draft is the product of Group B, which is one of, at least, two subgroups in the IRTF-Routing Research Group working on requirements for routing solutions for the future. This document sets out a set of requirements that we believe are important for the future routing architecture and future routing protocols. It should be noted that the IRTF-Routing Research group does not endorse this set of requirements or any other set of requirements as the one and only set of requirements.</t>
