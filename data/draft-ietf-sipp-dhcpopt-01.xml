      <t>This draft defines new options in the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) and the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to enable SIPP hosts, that are also IPv4-capable, to configure themselves automatically. The options enable a SIPP host to derive an address sequence, determine the scope of IPv4 reachability and discover the address sequences of default SIPP routers. The options are intended to be useful to SIPP hosts that conform to the SIPP transition specification, and operate in sites with minimal SIPP deployment. Terminology defined in the SIPP Routing and Addressing Specification and the DHCP Specification applies here.</t>
