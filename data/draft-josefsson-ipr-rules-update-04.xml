    <abstract>
      <t>Two problems with BCP 78 regarding the outbound rights granted to third parties are identified. A proposal to solve the problems is proposed. The first problem is that rights granted to third parties in BCP 78 are more restrictive then what was permitted through the license in RFC 2026. The rights granted by the new license is too limited for some uses of Contributions. The uses include adapting portions of Contributions for online help, reference manuals, and source code. The second problem is that rights to publish and distribute documents are not granted to third parties. We also discuss an issue that has been expressed regarding fake RFCs, that might have been permitted through our earlier license, and we also attempt to solve that problem.</t>
