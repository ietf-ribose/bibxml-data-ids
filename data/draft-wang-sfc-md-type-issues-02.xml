      <t>Service function chain is the definition of an ordered set of service functions. After instantiated, the service function path is created and the classified traffic is steered through the corresponding service function path and then forwarded to the final destination. Metadata (MD) is conveyed in SFC data plane which provides the ability to exchange context information between classifiers and SFs, among SFs, and between external systems and SFs. This document is motivated to state an issue when MD Type = 0x1.</t>
