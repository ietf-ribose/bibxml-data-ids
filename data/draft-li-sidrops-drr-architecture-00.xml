      <t>The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) plays a crucial role in securing inter-domain routing. However, the current RPKI Repository system suffers from fundamental limitations in reliability, scalability, and security. In particular, single-point failures at repository publication points (PPs), the growing number of bidirectional connections with relying parties (RPs), and the lack of mechanisms to mitigate misbehavior by certification authorities (CAs) pose significant risks to the integrity, authority, and resilience of the global RPKI ecosystem. This document proposes the Decentralized RPKI Repository (dRR), a novel repository architecture that decouples RPKI object signing from data distribution. dRR introduces a distributed federation of certificate servers (CSs) and a layer of Monitors to achieve robust, scalable, and auditable RPKI data management. The architecture maintains full compatibility with the existing RPKI trust model rooted in the five RIR trust anchors, enabling incremental deployment without disrupting current relying parties (RPs) validation semantics. By doing so, dRR addresses longstanding repository challenges and enhances the overall trustworthiness and efficiency of RPKI-based routing security.</t>
