      <t>The success of time sensitive services like VoIP telephony, video, etc., in a mobile environment depends heavily on the ability to minimize the impact of the traffic redirection during a change of packet forwarding path. In the process of establishing the new forwarding path, the nodes along the new path must be prepared to provide similar forwarding treatment to the IP packets. The transfer of context information may be advantageous in minimizing the impact of host mobility on IP services. This document captures the set of requirements for a context transfer framework and the requirements for a generic context transfer protocol to carry the context between the context transfer peers.</t>
