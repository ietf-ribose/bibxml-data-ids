    <abstract>
      <t>L4S and Diffserv offer somewhat overlapping services (low latency and low loss), but bandwidth allocation is out of scope for L4S. Therefore there is scope for the two approaches to complement each other, but also to conflict. This informational document explains how the two approaches interact, how they can be arranged to complement each other and in which cases one can stand alone without needing the other.</t>
