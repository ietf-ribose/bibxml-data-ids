      <t>This document presents a user perspective to the notion of DNS search layers as defined by John Klensin's DNS search model [DNS_SEARCH]. In particular, the authors look at the integration of name lookup results from layer 2, 3 and 4 services to discuss the presentation of these results across popular desktop applications such as Web browsing and email clients. The goal of this document is not to propose a standard UI to the DNS search problem (clearly something out of the scope of any IETF work). Instead, the document seeks to demonstrate that layered search services can be easily integrated within traditional desktop applications; hence that deployment of DNS search services is realistic and could rapidly be achieved. It is important to understand that the proposed form of integration and choice of user interfaces are not fundamental. In fact, the authors expect many competing systems to pursue different alternative solutions. However, in order to achieve critical deployment mass, it is crucial to demonstrate that the architectural model proposed by DNS search lends itself to simple user interfaces where different and possibly competing services can complete each other to provide a more precise and complete navigation experience for the end-user. This draft attempts to fulfill that goal by looking at possible solutions for popular navigation use cases.</t>
