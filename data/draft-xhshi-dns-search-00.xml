      <t>This document presents a user perspective to the notion of DNS searchlayers as defined by John Klensin's DNS search model [DNS_SEARCH]. Inparticular, the authors look at the integration of name lookupresults from layer 2, 3 and 4 services to discuss the presentation ofthese results across popular desktop applications such as Webbrowsing and email clients. The goal of this document is not topropose a standard UI to the DNS search problem (clearly somethingout of the scope of any IETF work). Instead, the document seeks todemonstrate that layered search services can be easily integratedwithin traditional desktop applications; hence that deployment of DNSsearch services is realistic and could rapidly be achieved. It isimportant to understand that the proposed form of integration andchoice of user interfaces are not fundamental. In fact, the authorsexpect many competing systems to pursue different alternativesolutions. However, in order to achieve critical deployment mass, itis crucial to demonstrate that the architectural model proposed byDNS search lends itself to simple user interfaces where different andpossibly competing services can complete each other to provide a moreprecise and complete navigation experience for the end-user. Thisdraft attempts to fulfill that goal by looking at possible solutionsfor popular navigation use cases.</t>
