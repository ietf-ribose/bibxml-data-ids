    <abstract>
      <t>This memo defines a threat model for access networks with AAA proxies. Use cases of current and future applications in which AAA proxies are employed are described and it is discussed how proxies could launch attacks in the defined use cases. The risk associated with these attacks in each use case is analyzed. In addition, mitigation techniques used in current AAA deployments are discussed and best practices for mitigating the identified attacks are identified. As a result, this draft can serve as a guideline for risk assessments and problem mitigation by providers, implementers and protocol designers of systems with proxies.</t>
