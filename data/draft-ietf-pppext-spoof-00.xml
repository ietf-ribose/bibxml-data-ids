      <t>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. This document describes a Network Control Protocol which will allow the two ends of a connection to agree to carry out protocol spoofing when an idle link is temporarily disconnected in order to save on connection charges. This work was originally motivated by the desire to exploit the fast call setup capability of ISDN, but is equally applicable in any situation in which a PPP connection is made over a link which can be temporarily suspended for whatever reason.</t>
