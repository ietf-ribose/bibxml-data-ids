      <t>IP packets (both IPv4 and IPv6) are understood to contain a unit of data which becomes the retransmission unit in case of loss. Upper layer protocols such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) prepare data units known as "segments", with traditional arrangements including a single segment per packet. This document presents a new construct known as the "IP Parcel" which permits a single packet to carry multiple segments, essentially creating a "packet-of-packets". Parcels can be broken into smaller parcels by a middlebox on the path if necessary, then rejoined into one or more repackaged parcels to be forwarded further toward the final destination. While not desirable, reordering of segments within parcels and individual segment loss are possible. But, what matters is that the number of parcels delivered to the final destination should be kept to a minimum, and that loss or receipt of individual segments (and not parcel size) determines the retransmission unit.</t>
