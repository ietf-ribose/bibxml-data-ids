      <t>This memo introduces a new object for carrying GRSVP-TE labels, namely Mp2Cp Label object. This new object SHOULD be used in order to move under the Control Plane (CP) domain LSPs that were created by the Management Plane (MP). The result of using Mp2Cp Label in GRSVP-TE is that, at the end of the signaling flow, an LSP that was created by Management Plane is moved under to Control Plane domain.</t>
