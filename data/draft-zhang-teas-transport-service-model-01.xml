    <abstract>
      <t>A transport network is a server-layer network designed to provide connectivity services for a client-layer network to carry the client traffic opaquely across the server-layer network resources. A transport network may be constructed from equipments utilizing any of a number of different transport technologies such as the evolving optical transport infrastructure (Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and Optical Transport Network (OTN)) or packet transport as epitomized by the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP). This draft provides a transport service YANG model that can be used together with the RESTCONF protocol for a northbound client to initiate service requests toward the transport network controllers via the RESTful interface between them so as to enable automated service interations.</t>
