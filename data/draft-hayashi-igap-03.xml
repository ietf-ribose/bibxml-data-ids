      <t>This memo documents the Internet Group membership Authentication Protocol (IGAP), a protocol developed by NTT, Nortel Networks and Panasonic. IGAP provides IGMP's group membership control between hosts and their first-hop routers, with the addition of user authentication and accounting. IGAP is designed to be used in a controlled or managed IPv4 multicast environment, when authentication and accounting are required. The user authentication information in IGAP can enable a provider to control the distribution of the multicast traffic as well as to collect real time user accounting information in an environment where the last-hop access networks are not shared.</t>
