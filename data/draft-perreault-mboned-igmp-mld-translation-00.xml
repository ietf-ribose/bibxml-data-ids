      <t>This document describes translation between IPv4 and IPv6 of multicast flows by an IGMP/MLD proxy. This allows single-stack nodes to participate in multicast groups from a different address family. Both sending and receiving is supported by this translation mechanism. Both any-source and source-specific multicast (ASM and SSM) are supported as well.</t>
