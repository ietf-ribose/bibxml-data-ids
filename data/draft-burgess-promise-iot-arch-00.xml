      <t>This draft describes architectural recommendations for an Internet of Things scenario, based on tried and tested principles from infrastructure science. We describe a functional service architecture that may be applied in the manner of a platform, from the smallest scale to the largest scale, using vendor agnostic principles. The current draft is rooted in the principles of Promise Theory[Bergstra1] and voluntary cooperation.</t>
