      <t>The [6rd] mechanism permit IPv6 "rapid deployment" across IPv4infrastructures of Internet Service Providers, but only in caseswhere customer-premise equipments can be upgraded to support it. 6rd+extends this IPv6 rapid deployment capability to hosts behindcustomer-premise equipments that cannot be upgraded (provided thesehosts can be upgraded themselves to support 6rd+). Like [6rd], 6rd+provides native IPv6 addresses, so that quality of service can beguaranteed by Internet Service Providers; it operates statelessly,which ensures simplicity and scalability; and it transmitsencapsulated IPv6 packets along optimized paths, which contributes toefficiency and acceptability.</t>
