      <t>Traffic steering (TS) mechanisms are designed to improve the overall utilization of network resources in terms of bandwidth and services, and to optimize traffic flow in terms of latency and jitter through the network. Most existing TS systems require human intervention to monitor and manage the assignment of specific paths to specific flows or traffic types, reducing the effectiveness of TS. I2RS, as a near real time programmatic interface to the routing system, provides the ability to manage TS systems in a more dynamic and iterative way. This document describes several TS use cases for I2RS.</t>
