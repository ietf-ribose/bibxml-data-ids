      <t>The behavior of mail lists on the Internet has become much more sophisticated than the alias expanders discussed in the standards for Internet messages formats. The lack of standard behavior for this part of the Internet messaging system creates confusion among users, resulting in misdirected or inappropriately duplicated messages. This document lists required behaviors for mail list managers derived from [RFC2821] and [RFC2822] in hopes of reducing the confusion, misdirected and duplicated mail, while at the same time simplifying the configuration process for mail list managers.</t>
