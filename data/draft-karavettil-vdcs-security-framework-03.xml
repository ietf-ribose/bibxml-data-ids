      <t>This document discusses the requirements and technology gaps related to security in the virtualized data center services (VDCS). The objective is to ensure end-to-end security for various types of carrier services built on virtualized infrastructure. The issues covered in this draft are focused on confidentiality and integrity of the services in the virtualized environment; including but not limited to infrastructure (IaaS), platform (PaaS), and application (SaaS) services. This draft also takes into account transient nature of identity, resources and connectivity in the virtualized environment.</t>
