      <t>This document defines a profile for certificates that are issued for validation of the digital signature produced by a single signing operation. Each certificate is created at the time of signing and bound to the signed content. The associated signing key is generated, used to produce a single digital signature, and then immediately destroyed. The certificate never expires and is never revoked, which simplifies long-term validation.</t>
