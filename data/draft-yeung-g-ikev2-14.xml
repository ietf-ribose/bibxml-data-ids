      <t>This document presents a set of IKEv2 exchanges that comprise a group key management protocol. The protocol is in conformance with the Multicast Security (MSEC) key management architecture, which contains two components: member registration and group rekeying. Both components require a Group Controller/Key Server to download IPsec group security associations to authorized members of a group. The group members then exchange IP multicast or other group traffic as IPsec packets. This document obsoletes RFC 6407.</t>
