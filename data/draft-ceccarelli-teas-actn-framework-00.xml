      <t>Transport networks have a variety of mechanisms to facilitate the separation of the data plane and control plane. They also have a range of management and provisioning protocols to configure and activate network resources. These mechanisms represent key technologies for enabling flexible and dynamic networking. Abstraction of network resources is a technique that can be applied to a single network domain or across multiple domains to create a single virtualized network that is under the control of a network operator that may be the customer of the operator that actually owns the network resources. This draft provides a framework for Abstraction and Control of Transport Networks (ACTN).</t>
