      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has seen widespread deploymentwithin individual domains, typically supporting voice and videocommunications. Though it was designed from the outset to supportinter-domain federation over the public Internet, such federation hasnot materialized. The primary reasons for this are the complexitiesof inter-domain phone number routing and concerns over security.This document reviews this problem space, outlines requirements, andthen describes a new model and technique for inter-domain federationwith SIP, called Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR).ViPR addresses the problems that have prevented inter-domainfederation over the Internet. It provides fully distributed inter-domain routing for phone numbers, authorized mappings from phonenumbers to domains, a new technique for automated VoIP anti-spam, andprivacy of number ownership, all while preserving the trapezoidalmodel of SIP.LegalThis documents and the information contained therein are provided onan "AS IS" basis and THE CONTRIBUTOR, THE ORGANIZATION HE/SHEREPRESENTS OR IS SPONSORED BY (IF ANY), THE INTERNET SOCIETY, THEIETF TRUST AND THE INTERNET ENGINEERING TASK FORCE DISCLAIM ALLWARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANYWARRANTY THAT THE USE OF THE INFORMATION THEREIN WILL NOT INFRINGEANY RIGHTS OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESSFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</t>
