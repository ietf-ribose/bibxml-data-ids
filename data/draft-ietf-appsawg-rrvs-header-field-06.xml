      <t>This document defines an extension for the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol called RRVS, and a header field called Require-Recipient- Valid-Since, to provide a method for senders to indicate to receivers the time when the sender last confirmed the ownership of the target mailbox. This can be used to detect changes of mailbox ownership, and thus prevent mail from being delivered to the wrong party. The intended use of these facilities is on automatically generated messages that might contain sensitive information, though it may also be useful in other applications.</t>
