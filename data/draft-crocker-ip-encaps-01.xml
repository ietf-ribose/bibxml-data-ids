      <t>The Internet seeks to increase the amount of IP address space that is available for hosts and to decrease the amount of table storage that is required by routers. Ultimately, the current IP (IP version 4) and any replacement are inherently incompatible and movement to the new version requires very substantial change to the IP installed base. This specification describes an approach which retains as much software, operations and training as possible, and minimizes overall operational disruption by allowing subsets of the Internet to carry the new-format Internet datagrams inside old-style IPv4 datagrams, using a technique called 'IP Address Encapsulation' (IPAE). This permits incremental and asynchronous introduction and makes transition entirely optional for portions of the Internet infrastructure. It further permits early reduction to routing table size.</t>
