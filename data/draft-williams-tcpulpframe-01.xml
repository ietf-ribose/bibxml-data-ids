      <t>This document proposes a framing protocol for TCP which is designedto be fully compliant with applicable TCP RFC's and fullyinteroperable with existing TCP implementations. The framingmechanism is designed to work as a 'shim' between TCP and higher-level protocols, preserving the reliable, in-order delivery of TCPwhile adding the preservation of higher-level protocol recordboundaries if the record is less than or equal to the path MTU. Theshim is designed to enable hardware acceleration of data movementoperations (e.g. direct placement of receive TCP segments intohigher-level protocol buffers) for the protocols that use it, evenif TCP segments are delivered out-of-order.</t>
