      <t>This document proposes a framing protocol for TCP which is designed to be fully compliant with applicable TCP RFC's and fully interoperable with existing TCP implementations. The framing mechanism is designed to work as a 'shim' between TCP and higher- level protocols, preserving the reliable, in-order delivery of TCP while adding the preservation of higher-level protocol record boundaries if the record is less than or equal to the path MTU. The shim is designed to enable hardware acceleration of data movement operations (e.g. direct placement of receive TCP segments into higher-level protocol buffers) for the protocols that use it, even if TCP segments are delivered out-of-order.</t>
