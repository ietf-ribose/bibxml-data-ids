      <t>[I-D.ietf-lsr-igp-ureach-prefix-announce] (UPA draft) proposes the solution to announce the prefix unreachable information within the IGP domain. It utilizes the LSInfinity concept that is introduced in [RFC2328], without analysis the dormant and flawed design. It defines some new flags to convey the maintenance information, which is not the role of IGP protocols and finally, there are several parts that are overlap with another precedent draft that discusses the corresponding contents more throughly. This document analyzes the above issues, suggests the IETF commuity abandon the UPA draft, replace it with other more comprehensive document [I-D.wang-lsr-prefix-unreachable-annoucement](Founder Draft), to provide the IETF community the more optimal solution.</t>
