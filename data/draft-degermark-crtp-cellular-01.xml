      <t>This document evaluates the performance of a header compressionprotocol for RTP, CRTP [RFC-2509], over links built on cellular radioaccess technology. The key characteristics affecting CRTP performanceover such links are the high error rates and the relatively longroundtrip time over the link.Bandwidth is typically expensive in cellular radio access networks,saving a single octet per voice packet can be equivalent to savingmany billion dollars in deployment since fewer base-stations areneeded. This is beneficial for operators as well as end-users who canget cheaper wireless IP telephony service.CRTP performance is evaluated for two kinds of link layers operatingover a realistic radio channel with high bit-error rates. Two mainconclusions are drawn. The first is that CRTP does not perform wellfor this type of link. The second is that in high-error environmentsit is very beneficial to have a checksum covering the compressedheader only, not the payload, so that the decompressor sees all non-damaged headers. When a strong checksum covers the entire link layerframe, header compression performs badly since too many headers arediscarded due to damaged payloads.</t>
