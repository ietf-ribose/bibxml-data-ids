      <t>This draft defines how XML Digital Signatures and XML Encryption maybe used with Multipart MIME security to provide MIME integrity andconfidentiality. It extends RFC 1847 by definingapplication/signature+xml and application/encryption+xml protocolsfor the Multipart/Signed and Multipart/Encrypted MIME types.Although non-XML content may be signed or encrypted based on XMLsigning and encryption, additional capabilities are available for XMLMIME content. This draft defines a signature transform parameter forpartial signing or manipulation of XML MIME content as well asprocessing rules in addition to the XML Digital Signature and XMLEncryption processing rules.</t>
