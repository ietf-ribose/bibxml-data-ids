      <t>MIME is a general-purpose mechanism for labeling andaggregating objects into complex hierarchies. Some MIMEobjects are discrete objects. If placed within another MIMEhierarchy, they need to appear as a leaf node in thecontaining hierarchy, rather than seeming to be continuationsof that hierarchy. This specification defines Content-typeApplication/MIME to provide an encapsulation mechanism forarbitrary MIME structures. This facilitates their treatmentas a single unit, rather than causing them to be treated aspart of any containing MIME hierarchy.</t>
