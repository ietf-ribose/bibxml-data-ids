      <t>I In current multipath load balancing network scenario, all path detection mechanisms have a defect. A typical load balancing route selection mechanism cannot cover all forwarding paths, which will cause missing detection.This document describes how to extend a new path detection mechanism to instruct intermediate devices to send probe packets to all downstream paths. This new mechanism is named load-sharing multipath replication forwarding (LMRF).</t>
