    <abstract>
      <t>Network-based security solutions are used by enterprises, public sector, and cloud service providers today in order to both complement and enhance host-based security solutions. TLS 1.3 introduces several changes to TLS 1.2 with a goal to improve the overall security and privacy provided by TLS. However some of these changes have a negative impact on network-based security solutions and deployments that adopt a multi-layered approach to security. While this may be viewed as a feature, there are several real-life use case scenarios where the same functionality and security can not be offered without such network-based security solutions. In this document, we identify the TLS 1.3 changes that may impact such use cases.</t>
