    <abstract>
      <t>Workflow is intuitive and powerful paradigm for capturing business processes, reasoning about them, and process specifications to produce corresponding implementations that are supported by the information systems. There has been a growing acceptance of workflow technology in numerous application domains such as telecommunications, software engineering, manufacturing, production, finance and banking, laboratory sciences, healthcare, shipping and office automation. In the last few years, pervasive network connectivity, exploded growth of Internet and web technologies has changed our computational landscape to distributed, heterogeneous and network centric computing model from centralized, desktop-oriented, and homogenous computing. This has raised challenging requirements for workflow technologies in terms being required to support heterogeneous, distributed computing infrastructures, interoperability, scalability and availability. The main objective of this document is to identify various business requirements for Internet based Workflow Access Protocol to instantiate, control and monitor the workflow process instances. Definition and administration of process specifications are not discussed in this requirements.</t>
