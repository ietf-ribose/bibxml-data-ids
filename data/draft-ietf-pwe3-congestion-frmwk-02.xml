      <t>Pseudowires are sometimes used to carry non-TCP data flows. In thesecircumstances the service payload will not react to networkcongestion by reducing its offered load. Pseudowires shouldtherefore reduces their network bandwidth demands in the face ofsignificant packet loss, including if necessary completely ceasingtransmission. Since it is difficult to determine a priori the numberof equivalent TCP flow that a pseudowire represents, a suitably"fair" rate of back-off cannot be pre-determined. This documentdescribes pseudowire congestion problem and provides guidance on thedevelopment suitable solutions.</t>
