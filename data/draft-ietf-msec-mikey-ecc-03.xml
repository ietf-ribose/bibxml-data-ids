      <t>This document proposes extensions to the authentication, encryption and digital signature methods described for use in MIKEY, employing elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC). These extensions are defined to align MIKEY with other ECC implementations and standards. It should be noted that this document is not self-contained; it uses the notations and definitions of [RFC3830].</t>
