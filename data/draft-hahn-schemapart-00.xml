      <t>IETF RFC 2251 [RFC2251] provides a mechanism for indicating, given any particular entry in the directory tree, what entry in the directory tree holds the directory schema information for that particular entry. RFC 2251 does not, however, provide guidance on how different directory servers, each of which might have their own active directory schema, should “publicize” this directory schema such that the different active schemas are distinct from one another when viewing the entire directory name-space. This document describes a way to name sub-schema sub-entry entries such that different active schemas can be distinguished from one another across the entire directory name-space.</t>
