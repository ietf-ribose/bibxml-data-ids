      <t>In current Internet, HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 protocol has limited methods tocontrol resource access. Usually it's achieved by modifying theconfiguration of the cache and proxy to enforce the access controlrules. When original server's access control list (ACL) is updated,a reconfiguration of cache and proxy systems on the chain isrequired for the change to take effect, which always impacts thenetwork stability. This document introduces a new access controlmechanism, which introduces a new header field to dynamicallycontrol resource access.</t>
