    <abstract>
      <t>The scaling DetNet (Deterministic Networking) technology based on cyclic queuing and scheduling is expected to solve the scalability problem of DetNet. One of the key technologies is to accurately obtain the cyclic mapping relationship between adjacent nodes and the packets can achieve the end-to-end deterministic forwarding. This draft describes the method for nodes to learn the cycle mapping relationship through sending learning messages.</t>
