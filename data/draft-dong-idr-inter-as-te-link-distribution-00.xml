    <abstract>
      <t>Protocol extensions to Interial Gataway Protocols (IGPs) have been specified for the flooding of Traffice Engineering (TE) information of the Inter-Autonomous System (AS) links into the local AS (RFC 5392 and RFC 5316), in which some information of the inter-AS links needs to be manually configured. This document proposes BGP extensions for dynamic advertisement of TE information of Inter-AS links between adjacent ASes. Such mechanism may also be used for the distribution of Inter-AS TE link information to some external entities, such as Path Computation Element (PCE).</t>
