      <t>In contrast to other Internet services, most SIP sessions take place between individuals. Today's billing schemes (flat rate or volume based) do not reflect that. A caller causes costs on the callee's side. With SIP's authentication methods and few additional headers, a SIP billing service could be established that would enable callees to charge their callers. Call stateful proxies are not required.</t>
