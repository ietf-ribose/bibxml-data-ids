      <t>This document describes a mechanism to establish end-to-end disjoint LSPs in a multiple area domain, as required for inter-area end-to-end protection. This mechanism relies on the joint computation of the working and backup LSPs segments in each area. A new RSVP-TE object called the Associated Route Object, ARO, is defined and used in the signaling messages in support of this scheme.</t>
