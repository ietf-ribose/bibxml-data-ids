    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a transition mechanism that combines both [SIIT] and DSTM mechanisms by adding some extensions to allow fast routing of inbound packets. This will result in a more decentralised and flexible tool to allow V6 only hosts to communicate with V4 only hosts. The proposed extensions will provide a way that allows SIIT routers to route packets addressed to a host running a single IPv6 stack with minimum delay which is suited to real time services.</t>
