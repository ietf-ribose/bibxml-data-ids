      <t>This document specifies a transition mechanism that combines both[SIIT] and DSTM mechanisms by adding some extensions to allow fastrouting of inbound packets. This will result in a more decentralisedand flexible tool to allow V6 only hosts to communicate with V4 onlyhosts.The proposed extensions will provide a way that allows SIIT routersto route packets addressed to a host running a single IPv6 stack withminimum delay which is suited to real time services.</t>
