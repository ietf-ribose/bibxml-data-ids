    <abstract>
      <t>AI fabric is sensitive to bandwidth. Congestion management, including congestion control and load balancing, is a main method to fully utilize network resource. However, current congestion management mechanisms are not coordinated, which lead to throughput decreasing. This document provides a scheme to coordinate different congestion management mechanisms. It describes the design principle, behaviors of network switches and hosts in the scheme, and gives an example to show end-to-end procedure.</t>
