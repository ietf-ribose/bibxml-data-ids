    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes secure network management in Segment Routing version six (SRv6) network. It proposes a framework empowered with Intent-Based Networking (IBN). The Intent-based Network Management (IBNM) in this document deals with a closed-loop network control, network policy translation, and network management audit. To support these three features, it specifies an architectural framework with system components and interfaces. Also, this framework can support the use cases in SRv6 network.</t>
