      <t>A Host Identity Protocol supporting host is able to use multipleinterfaces simultaneously when it implements the Mobility andMultihoming HIP extensions. The protocol defines currentlysimultaneous usage via multiple interfaces only towards differentpeer hosts. Simultaneously using multiple interfaces towards onepeer node was not defined due to e.g. potential problems with upperlayer congestion control algorithms. The limitation of that protocolis that it allows only one interface to be used at a time between themulti-homed host and the peer host. There is no mechanism toseparate the flows between two hosts and to allow them to usedifferent interfaces independent from each other. This memo presentsa method where two HIP hosts, of which at least one is multi-homed,can separate different upper layer data flows such as TCP and UDPbetween the hosts and allow them to use different interfaces at themulti-homed host.</t>
