      <t>This document defines monitoring and status MIBs for IPSec. It does not define MIBs that may be used for configuring IPSec implementations or for providing low-level diagnostic or debugging information. Further, it does not provide policy information. Those MIBs may be defined in later versions of this document or in other documents. The purpose of the MIBs is to allow system administrators to determine operating conditions and perform system operational level monitoring of the IPSec portion of their network. Statistics are provided as well.</t>
