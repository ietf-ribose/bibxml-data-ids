      <t>This draft describes the decisions made in one pair of applications [4][5] that respectively serves and retrieve OpenPGP [3] Certificates and Revocation Signatures using the CERT Resources Record [2]. The intent is to provide a discussion on the kind of general updates needed to the CERT specification, and some suggested specific updates for the OpenPGP sub-type. It is offered in the hope that this specification, together with similar efforts for other applications, can be reviewed when designing a generic solution or guidelines for storing application keying material in the Domain Name System (DNS), should it ever happen.</t>
