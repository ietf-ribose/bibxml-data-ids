      <t>This document focuses on the Admission Control functionality performed by the Edge Router in the IntServ/DiffServ interworking scenario described in [COPS-ISDS]. More precisely it describes the interaction between the RSVP and the COPS protocols in the Edge Router and introduces an API (Application Programming Interface) aimed at allowing the intercommunication between them. Anyway, the API described here is designed as a flexible interface, and should be able to support communication between a generic application and the COPS Client Type described in [COPS-ODRA].</t>
