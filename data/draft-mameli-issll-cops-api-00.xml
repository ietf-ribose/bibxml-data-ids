      <t>This document focuses on the Admission Control functionality performedby the Edge Router in the IntServ/DiffServ interworking scenariodescribed in [COPS-ISDS]. More precisely it describes the interactionbetween the RSVP and the COPS protocols in the Edge Router andintroduces an API (Application Programming Interface) aimed at allowingthe intercommunication between them. Anyway, the API described here isdesigned as a flexible interface, and should be able to supportcommunication between a generic application and the COPS Client Typedescribed in [COPS-ODRA].</t>
