      <t>[ID-PMIP6-RO-PS] describes the problem space of localized routingwhich allows end-to-end user traffic forwarding between MN and CNdirectly without involving Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in a singleProxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] domain. However, localized routing withIPv4 support which allows IPv4 transport between MAG and LMA and/orIPv4 enabled user traffic between MN and CN is not considered. Thisdocument details the scenarios and problem statement for localizedrouting with IPv4 support.</t>
