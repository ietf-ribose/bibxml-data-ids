      <t>[ID-PMIP6-RO-PS] describes the problem space of localized routing which allows end-to-end user traffic forwarding between MN and CN directly without involving Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) in a single Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] domain. However, localized routing with IPv4 support which allows IPv4 transport between MAG and LMA and/or IPv4 enabled user traffic between MN and CN is not considered. This document details the scenarios and problem statement for localized routing with IPv4 support.</t>
