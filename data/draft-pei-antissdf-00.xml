      <t>In cognitive sensor networks, the cooperative spectrum sensing can effectively improve the accuracy of spectrum sensing. However, it is also facing with the security issues caused by attacks of potential malicious users. Lots of algorithms are proposed in existing literatures to cope with the potential attacks. However, the traditional strategies are mainly suitable for relative simple and ideal attack such as the all "1" or all "0" attack. Therefore, we define a more universal anti Spectrum Sensing Data Falsification (SSDF) framework in the document, which can better cope with the probabilistic attacks and random attacks which are closer to the reality.</t>
