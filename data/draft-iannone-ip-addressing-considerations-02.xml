      <t>The Internet Protocol (IP) has been the major technological success in information technology of the last half century. As the Internet becomes pervasive, IP has been replacing communication technology for many domain-specific solutions, but it also has been extended to better fit the specificities of the different use cases. For Internet addressing in particular, as it is defined in RFC 791 for IPv4 and RFC 8200 for IPv6, respectively, there exist many extensions.

This document discusses the properties the IP addressing model, showcasing the continuing need to extend it and the methods used for doing so.</t>
