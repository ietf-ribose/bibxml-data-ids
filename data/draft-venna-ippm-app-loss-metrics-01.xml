      <t>Using the one-way loss pattern metrics defined in RFC 3357, this document defines two new metrics Type-P-One-Way-Complete-Frame-Loss and Type-P-One-Way-Partial-Frame-Received to provide a better understanding of the affects of packet loss at the application level. The statistic Type-P-One-Way-Errored-Seconds is derived from the above metrics to compute the affect of packet loss at the application level.</t>
