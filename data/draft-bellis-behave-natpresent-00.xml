      <t>End-to-end applications have difficulty distinguishing between packets that have been passed through a Network Address Translator (NAT) and packets that have been passed along a clear end-to-end path. We propose mechanisms for IPv4 and IPv6 whereby NAT devices explicitly signal their operation as a means of allowing applications to distinguish the presence of otherwise undetected NATs in the end- to-end path.</t>
