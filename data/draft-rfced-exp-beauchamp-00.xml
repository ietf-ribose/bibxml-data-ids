      <t>As in RFC-1235, our implementation uses UDP [2] as the transport protocol but this is not a requirement of the protocol. Any broadcast datagram protocol could be employed. The satellite broadcast implementation assumes that there is only a single, unidirectional link (the satellite channel) between the source and recipient and that acknowledgment information from the recipient to the source is carried on a separate and independent media.</t>
