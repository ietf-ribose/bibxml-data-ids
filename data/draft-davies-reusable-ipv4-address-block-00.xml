      <t>Although IPv6 is being introduced globally, the entire IP ecosystem will not have transitioned to IPv6 before the forecast exhaustion of the global IPv4 address pools. This document describes a new transitional non-conflicting reusable IPv4 address block which will facilitate a smooth IPv4 to IPv6 transition for customers and transit providers. The address block would be assigned by IANA and have a limited time horizon to match its transitional purpose.</t>
