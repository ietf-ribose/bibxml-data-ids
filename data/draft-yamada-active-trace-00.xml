      <t>General traceback protocols (e.g. itrace) only consider to sendtraceback information from Generator to Tracer. But they are nothelpful when victims and/or Tracer want to know who attacks thembecause of conventional traceback mechanisms have not beenreflected in Tracer intention. Therefore this draft proposes anadditional protocol for conventional traceback protocols,especially itrace, to reflect in Tracer intention and be able tocontrol generation of traceback information by Generator.</t>
