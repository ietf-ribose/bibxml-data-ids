    <abstract>
      <t>Traditional QoS technology can not achieve fine adjustment in the traffic scheduling, and has a large amount of configuration and poor maintainability. BGP FlowSpec technology provides a wealth of filtering conditions and processing actions, using BGP network layer reachable information (NLRI) to transmit traffic filtering information, which can achieve a more fine-grained control of the traffic and improve maintainability. This document defines the extension of BGP FlowSpec, adding new traffic filtering actions for extended community: minimum bandwidth guarantee and congestion management, to enable better management and scheduling of traffic, further improving the scalability and applicability of FlowSpec.</t>
