      <t>Current Internet Service Providers (ISPs) scale their networks byusing the RADIUS protocol, which provides user Authentication,Authorization and Accounting (AAA) of Dial-up PPP clients. The recentwork done in the Roaming Operations (ROAMOPS) Working Group was toinvestigate whether RADIUS could be used in a roaming network, andconcluded that RADIUS was ill-suited for inter-domain purposes.The IETF has formed a new NAS Requirements Working Group, and part oftheir charter is to document the next generation NAS' AAArequirements. Recently, the Mobile-IP Working Group also documentedtheir own AAA requirements that would help Mobile IP scale forInter-Domain mobility.The DIAMETER protocol is a follow-on to the RADIUS protocol. DIAMETERaddresses the known RADIUS deficiencies, and is intended for use withthe NASREQ and Mobile IP application space.</t>
