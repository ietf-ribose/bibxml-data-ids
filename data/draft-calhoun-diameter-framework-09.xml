      <t>Current Internet Service Providers (ISPs) scale their networks by using the RADIUS protocol, which provides user Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) of Dial-up PPP clients. The recent work done in the Roaming Operations (ROAMOPS) Working Group was to investigate whether RADIUS could be used in a roaming network, and concluded that RADIUS was ill-suited for inter-domain purposes. The IETF has formed a new NAS Requirements Working Group, and part of their charter is to document the next generation NAS' AAA requirements. Recently, the Mobile-IP Working Group also documented their own AAA requirements that would help Mobile IP scale for Inter-Domain mobility. The DIAMETER protocol is a follow-on to the RADIUS protocol. DIAMETER addresses the known RADIUS deficiencies, and is intended for use with the NASREQ and Mobile IP application space.</t>
