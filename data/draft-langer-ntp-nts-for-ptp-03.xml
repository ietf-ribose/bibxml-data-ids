    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a key management service for automatic key management for the integrated security mechanism (prong A) of IEEE Std 1588[TM]-2019 (PTPv2.1) described there in Annex P. It implements a key management for the immediate security processing approach and offers a security solution for all relevant PTP modes. The key management service for PTP is based on and extends the NTS Key Establishment protocol defined in IETF RFC 8915 for securing NTP, but works completely independent from NTP.</t>
