      <t>Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are typically characterized by high latency and lack of constant end to end connectivity, consistent with their use in deep space communications. This, however, is not the limit of application of Bundle Protocol (BP) and related DTN enabling technologies. Through a collection of Convergance Layer Adapters (CLAs), deployment overlaying the terrestrial Internet is a core component of DTN implementations. IPN is a integer based naming scheme for DTN networks. Nothwithstanding cryptographic considerations, three basic components are necessary to make a BP overlay network connection, the IP address of the node, the CBHE Node Number (IPN component), and the CLA which provides IP connectivity. This document describes RRTYPE additions to DNS to enable terrestrial BP resource look up.</t>
