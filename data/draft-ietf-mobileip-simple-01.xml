      <t>This document describes an alternative to the support for IP mobility compared to the solution outlined and specified in [MobIP]. As the title of the solution implies, it addresses the problems with the overall complexity of the current Mobile IP solution including some of the proposed extensions as outlined in [RouteOpt], [3G-IMT]. This more simplistic approach relies on two basic prerequisites: Development made in recent years, and also development foreseen in a near-term future, regarding certain key protocols and techniques for name-to-address resolution, directory services, address assignment, and roaming support; and also the fact that the solution is suited for usage within one organizational scope.</t>
