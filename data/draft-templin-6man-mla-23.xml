    <abstract>
      <t>Ad Hoc networks often present a challenging environment for IPv6 addressing due to the indeterminant neighborhood properties of their interfaces. IPv6 nodes assign IPv6 addresses to their Ad Hoc network interface connections that must be locally unique but must not be propagated to other networks. IPv6 nodes must therefore be able to assign topology-independent addresses to their interfaces when topology-oriented IPv6 address delegation services are either absent or only intermittently available. This document introduces a new IPv6 address type that a node can autonomously assign to its Ad Hoc network interfaces.</t>
