      <t>The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS- API), as defined in RFC-1508, provides security services to callers in a generic fashion, supportable with a range of underlying mechanisms and technologies and hence allowing source-level portability of applications to different environments. It defines GSS-API services and primitives at a level independent of underlying mechanism and programming language environment. The GSSAPI allows a caller application to authenticate a principal identity associated with a peer application, to delegate rights to a peer, and to apply security services such as confidentiality and integrity on a per-message basis. The primitives of the GSS-API do not currently allow support of security attributes other than a single identity and do not allow fine control of delegation. The additional primitives described in this document provide support for: * the exchange of a variety of security attributes, and the construction of authorization functions using these attributes, including delegated ones, (attribute handling support functions), * fine control over delegation by allowing specification of the delegation method, the acceptor(s) of a security context, their type and the restrictions that may apply (acceptor control and support functions).</t>
