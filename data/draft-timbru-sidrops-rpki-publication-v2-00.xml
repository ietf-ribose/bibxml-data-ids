      <t>The RPKI Publication Protocol first described in RFC 8181 has worked very well. That said, as it turns out, there are a number of requirements emerging from operational experience which cannot be supported by the current protocol. In particular, identity key roll overs, support for publication quota and stricter verification of content by the server. This document is an early write-up with the following goals: (1) support discussions about requirements for additional work and (2) explore a possible version 2 with solutions to meet those requirements.</t>
