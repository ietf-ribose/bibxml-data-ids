    <abstract>
      <t>This document discusses the requirement of capability of information distribution among autonomic nodes in autonomic networks. In general, information distribution can be categorized into two different modes: 1) one autonomic node instantly sends information to other nodes in the domain; 2) one autonomic node can publish some information and then some other interested nodes can subscribe the published information. In the former case, information data will be generated and consumed instantly. In the latter case, however, information data shall be stored in the network and retrieved when necessary. These capabilities are fundamental and basic to a network system and an autonomic network infrastructure (ANI) should consider to integrate them, rather than assisted by other transport or routing protocols (HTTP, BGP/IGP as bearing protocols etc.). Thus, this document clarifies possible use cases and requirements to ANI so that information distribution can be natively supported. Possible options to realize the information distribution function are also briefly discussed.</t>
