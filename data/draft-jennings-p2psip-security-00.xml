      <t>This document describes an overview of some security mechanisms for P2P SIP. Specifically it discusses mechanisms that can be used to secure the stored data and the routing in the distributed storage. This draft is an very early draft to outline the possible solution space and far more details would be needed. This work is being discussed on the p2psip@ietf.org mailing list.</t>
