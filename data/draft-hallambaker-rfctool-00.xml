      <t>This memo presents a technique for using as subset HTML as a source format for documents in the Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) and Request for Comments (RFC) series. The HTML subset provides equivalent functionality to the traditional XML2RFC tool but is designed for ease of use with readily available editing tools. Extensions to the HTML markup allow the use of external bibliography files to manage citations and references in the manner of BibTeX. Planned extensions include building concordances of defined terms and normative language.</t>
