    <abstract>
      <t>There have been a lot of academic research and industrial practice in the area of COIN, but most of them are case-by-case design and currently they also rely heavily on programmable network devices, which lacks some generality and scalability, thus will impede the development of COIN. This document summarizes the computing primitives/operations/semantics that can be implemented inside the network, through analysis of different COIN use cases, and proposes a generic framework of COIN in the controlled environments. Enabling technologies related to the framework and the standardization landscape are also analyzed in the document.</t>
