      <t>In ISDN interfaces the D-channel is used to transport the Q.931 signalling messages. In addition, the D-channel can transport packet data for user-to-user communication. The Megaco protocol specification has to be extended to support data in an ISDN D- channel. More specifically, ephemeral terminations on top of physical ISDN terminations have to be allowed, and support for the ISDN addressing scheme has to be added to refer to the data streams in the D-channel. This draft defines the required additional functionality, that could be part of the second version of the Megaco protocol.</t>
