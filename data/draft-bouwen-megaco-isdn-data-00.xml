      <t>In ISDN interfaces the D-channel is used to transport the Q.931signalling messages. In addition, the D-channel can transport packetdata for user-to-user communication. The Megaco protocolspecification has to be extended to support data in an ISDN D-channel. More specifically, ephemeral terminations on top ofphysical ISDN terminations have to be allowed, and support for theISDN addressing scheme has to be added to refer to the data streamsin the D-channel. This draft defines the required additionalfunctionality, that could be part of the second version of theMegaco protocol.</t>
