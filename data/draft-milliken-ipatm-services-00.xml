      <t>This paper describes an integrated services approach to supporting IP multicast over ATM, including both best-effort delivery and quality of service-based (QoS) traffic. Best-effort traffic is assumed to be relatively low-volume and short-duration sessions, and thus should not incur ATM VC setup overhead. QoS-based traffic is assumed to be high-volume, long-duration sessions, and ATM VC setup is thus both desirable and necessary (to support quality of service demands). Best-effort traffic delivery is based on standard IGMP and IP multicast routing. QoS support is provided by use of RSVP. Various types of 'short-cut' ATM VC setup can be supported by minor changes to router behavior and the RSVP protocol.</t>
