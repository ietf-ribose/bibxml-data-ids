    <abstract>
      <t>Networks and network applications must be robust and reliable. Formany applications and services, such as packetized voice, correcting afailure must be almost instantaneous. The first step in correcting afailure is, of course, detecting that it occurred. IP routingprotocols and signaling protocols as well as many application layerprotocols incorporate their own keepalive mechanisms to detectfailures. Typically, these protocols detect failures on the order ofseconds or tens of seconds. While there are some physical and linklayer technologies that inherently supply link outage detection, notall link layers do this. In order to provide for fast failuredetection over any type of lower layer, an IP layer fast keepaliveprotocol can be used. This draft describes such a protocol for quicklydetecting when a network layer interface of a peer has failed.</t>
