      <t>This specification designs an architecture that aims at load balancing flows along multiple routes according to a measure of their average traffic loads. This architecture supports such a service due to the operation in a closed loop of an enhanced routing control plane with an enhanced forwarding plane. Basically, this routing paradigm allows a second dynamic metric called load to be taken into account when calculating new routes and when forwarding the flows along the routes.</t>
