      <t>Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality ofservice for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. Theoverall PCN architecture is described in ID.PCNArch. This memo isone of a series describing possible boundary node behaviours for aPCN domain. The behaviour described here is that for three-statemeasurement-based load control, known informally as CL. Therequirement for three encoding states means that CL is forexperimental use only pending further standards action.</t>
