      <t>Precongestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. The overall PCN architecture is described in ID.PCNArch. This memo is one of a series describing possible boundary node behaviours for a PCN domain. The behaviour described here is that for three-state measurement-based load control, known informally as CL. The requirement for three encoding states means that CL is for experimental use only pending further standards action.</t>
