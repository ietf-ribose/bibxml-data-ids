      <t>This is a working document intended to focus discussion and refine draft language for the CoAP protocol specification (or other proposed standards) in the areas of discovery, naming, and addressing. Requirements on discovery are motivated. Special emphasis is placed on group definition and discovery. Examples show how groups can be represented in CoAP Resource Directories or DNS-SD.</t>
