      <t>The intention of this document is to analyze the set of requirements for OAM in MPLS-TP as defined in [MPLS-TP OAM Requirements], to verify whether the existing MPLS OAM tools can be applied to these requirements, identify which of the existing tools need to be extended, and which new tools should be defined. Eventually, the purpose of the document is to recommend which of the existing tools should be extended and what new tools should be defined to support the set of OAM requirements for MPLS-TP.</t>
