      <t>This document defines a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected content type for Autonomous System Relationship Authorization (ASRA) objects for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). An ASRA is a digitally signed object through which the issuer (the holder of an Autonomous System identifier), can authorize one or more other Autonomous Systems (ASes) as its customers and lateral peers. When validated, an ASRA's eContent can be used for detection and mitigation of BGP AS path manipulation attacks together with Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA). ASRA is complementary to ASPA.</t>
