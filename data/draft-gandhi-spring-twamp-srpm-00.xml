    <abstract>
      <t>Segment Routing (SR) is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. This document specifies procedures for sending and processing in-band probe query and response messages for Performance Measurement. The procedure uses the mechanisms defined in RFC 5357 (Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP)) for Delay Measurement, and also uses the mechanisms for direct-mode loss measurement defined in this document. The procedure specified is applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes for both links and end-to-end measurement for SR Policies.</t>
