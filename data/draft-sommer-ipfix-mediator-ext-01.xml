      <t>IPFIX supports the concept of a Mediator, a device that receives,transforms, and exports data streams using IPFIX. One of the mostimportant requirements is the reduction of the volume of IPFIXtraffic by aggregating and discarding received information. Thisdocument introduces a number of extensions to the IPFIX InformationModel that support the export of aggregated IPFIX data, introducingabstract data types and Information Elements that optimize thetransport of descriptive information in terms of flow records' amountand size. All extensions are directly applicable to the IPFIXMediator but can be used in many different applications as well.</t>
