      <t>This memo describes IP-SVC that is another ATM signaling protocol for implementing IP protocols. IP-SVC restricts the range of signaling to an IP subnet, and this restriction makes the IP-SVC structure simple. IP-SVC provides easy implementation of the mechanism of ARP and IP multicasting without any servers. IP-SVC can not establish VCs across IP subnet boundaries by itself. However, adapting CSRs (Cell Switching Routers) with RSVP (Resource ReSerVation Protocol) enables end-to-end VC establishment across IP subnet boundaries in IP/ATM LANs based on IP-SVC. This method also shows one solution of RSVP over ATM.</t>
