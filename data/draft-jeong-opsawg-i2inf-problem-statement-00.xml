    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the problem statement for Interface to In- Network Functions (I2INF) for a user's services involved in both networks and applications. In-Network Functions (INF) include In- Network Computing Functions (INCF) in Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). They also include In-Network Application Functions (INAF) in Internet-of- Things (IoT) Devices, Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Intent-Based Networking (IBN) can be used to realize the user's services consisting of a combination of INFs in a target network. This document analyzes the gap for an IBN-based system to perform the user's service and specifies the requirements for the I2INF for intelligent service provisioning.</t>
