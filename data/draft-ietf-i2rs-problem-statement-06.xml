      <t>As modern networks grow in scale and complexity, the need for rapid and dynamic control increases. With scale, the need to automate even the simplest operations is important, but even more critical is the ability to quickly interact with more complex operations such as policy-based controls. In order to enable network applications to have access to and control over information in the Internet's routing system, we need a publicly documented interface specification. The interface needs to support real-time, asynchronous interactions using data models and encodings that are efficient and potentially different from those available today. Furthermore, the interface must be tailored to support a variety of use cases. This document expands upon these statements of requirements to provide a detailed problem statement for an Interface to the Routing System (I2RS).</t>
