      <t>This draft proposes a new packet format motivated with the goal of having a single protocol for constrained IoT and unconstrained infrastructure segments of an ICN network. The packet format focuses on reducing the transport overhead compared to the one proposed in [1]. The resulting savings in terms of energy and computing is significant for low power radios with restricted payload size.</t>
