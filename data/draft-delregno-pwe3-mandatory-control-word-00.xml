      <t>Of the many variations of PWE3 Encapsulations and Modes (e.g. Ethernet, Port Mode, VLAN Mode, etc), only five have the Control Word (CW) as being optional. As a result, this causes an issue with VCCV Control Channel selection. This draft endeavors to resolve the issue going forward by making the Control Word, and subsequently the CW- based VCCV Control Channel, mandatory for all PWE3 Encapsulations.</t>
