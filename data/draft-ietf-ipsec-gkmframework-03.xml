    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides a framework for group key management for multicast security, motivated by three main considerations, namely the multicast application, scalability and trust-relationships among entities. It introduces two planes corresponding to the network entities and functions important to multicasting and to security. The key management plane consists of two hierarchy-levels in the form of a single 'trunk region' (inter-region) and one or more 'leaf regions' (intra-region). The advantages of the framework among others are that it is scalable, it has reduced complexity and allows the independence in regions of group key management.</t>
