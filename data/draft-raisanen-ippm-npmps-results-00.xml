      <t>Actual measurement results obtained with npmps-like [2] measurement setup are described and their relation to the npmps draft are discussed. The presented results use a subset of the npmps metric, and are presented to give an example of the use of the metric for reporting real results. An example of derivative use of measurement results is provided. A full text of the draft, including figures, can be downloaded in PDF format from http://www-nrc.nokia.com/netperf/results.pdf.</t>
