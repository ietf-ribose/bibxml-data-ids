      <t>During RSVP-TE graceful restart (GR), the LSR communicates with its directly connected neighbors to synchronize LSP state to recover from control plane failure conditions. However, when the LSP has undergone a Fast Re-route (FRR), the directly connected neighbor of the Point of Local Repair (PLR) or Merge Point (MP) could be down. The FRR condition of the LSP could exist for a substantial period of time. During this period the network is vulnerable to traffic loss if control plane experiences a failure on the PLR or MP. This draft describes a mechanism to extend RSVP- TE GR to work under conditions where FRR has occurred.</t>
