      <t>Interoperation of Instant Messaging and Presence systems has been defined in IMPP Working Group. IMPP WG has come up with baseline interoperable operations and formats for Presence and Instant Messaging systems. However, these base formats might need standardized extensions in order to enable building rational applications using Presence and Instant Messaging. This memo proposes an extension to PIDF presence document format to be used in SIMPLE based Presence systems [1] but may also be applied to other protocols as well.</t>
