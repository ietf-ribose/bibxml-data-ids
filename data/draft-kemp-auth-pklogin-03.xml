      <t>This document defines the Public Key Login (PKL) protocol, a challenge-response authentication mechanism using digital signatures. It providesstart-of-session authentication for firewall proxies, dial-up NetworkAccess Servers, remote email servers, and interactive protocols such asTelnet and FTP. It provides functionality similar to One Time Passwordsand handheld authentication tokens, and it supports both one-way andmutual authentication. PKL uses the authentication exchanges specifiedin ISO/IEC 9798-3 and NIST FIPS Pub 196. The PKL protocol provides strong authentication at the beginning of asession, but does not by itself provide communication channel integrityor confidentiality. PKL should be used in conjunction with a channelintegrity mechanism, for example to provide authentication of individualusers over (host-keyed) Virtual Private Network connections. This Internet Draft is intended to be the last version of the PKLspecification prior to publication as an Informational RFC. Comments arerequested no later than the expiration date of this draft.</t>
