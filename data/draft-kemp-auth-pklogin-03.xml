      <t>This document defines the Public Key Login (PKL) protocol, a challenge- response authentication mechanism using digital signatures. It provides start-of-session authentication for firewall proxies, dial-up Network Access Servers, remote email servers, and interactive protocols such as Telnet and FTP. It provides functionality similar to One Time Passwords and handheld authentication tokens, and it supports both one-way and mutual authentication. PKL uses the authentication exchanges specified in ISO/IEC 9798-3 and NIST FIPS Pub 196. The PKL protocol provides strong authentication at the beginning of a session, but does not by itself provide communication channel integrity or confidentiality. PKL should be used in conjunction with a channel integrity mechanism, for example to provide authentication of individual users over (host-keyed) Virtual Private Network connections. This Internet Draft is intended to be the last version of the PKL specification prior to publication as an Informational RFC. Comments are requested no later than the expiration date of this draft.</t>
