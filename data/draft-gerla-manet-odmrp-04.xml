      <t>The On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) is a multicast routing protocol designed for ad hoc networks with mobile hosts. ODMRP is a mesh-based, rather than a conventional tree-based, multicast scheme and uses a forwarding group concept (only a subset of nodes forwards the multicast packets via scoped flooding). It applies on-demand procedures to dynamically build routes and maintain multicast group membership, without relying on pre-existing unicast routing protocols. ODMRP is well suited for ad hoc wireless networks with mobile hosts where bandwidth is limited, topology changes frequently and rapidly, and power is constrained.</t>
