      <t>Documents in the RFC series normally use only plain-text ASCIIcharacters and a fixed-width font. However, there is sometimes aneed to supplement the ASCII text with graphics or picture images.The historic solution to this requirement, allowing secondary PDF andPostscript files, is seldom used because it is awkward for authorsand publisher. This memo suggests a more convenient scheme forattaching authoritative diagrams, illustrations, or other graphics toRFCs. It further proposes conventions for additional input anddisplay formats, to improve readability. This proposal is based ondraft-rfc-image-files-00, by Braden and Klensin, and revises it aslittle as possible, while expanding the goals of the effort.</t>
