      <t>The Host Identity Protocol [RFC5201] is a secure signaling protocol with a cryptographic namespace. It provides the communicating peers with a cryptographic puzzle mechanism to protect against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks exploiting the computation and memory overheads of the protocol exchange. This document specifies an extension of the protocol that enables an on-path network entity to assist in the choice of the puzzle difficulty in case of an attack. Furthermore, it defines a modification of the puzzle mechanism that enables a host to delegate puzzle solving to an on-path network entity.</t>
