      <t>Limiting and preventing SPAM for Internet Telephony (SPIT) is seen as an important task for future security work in the Voice over IP environment. This document addresses the problem by utilizing the concept introduced by the SIP Identity Framework in combination with the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) to warrant certain security relevant attributes from one administrative domain to another. This approach allows the destination domain to make intelligent filtering decisions when receiving voice calls.</t>
