      <t>An IoT-specific IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration is suggested for diverse types of IoT devices. Both domain type and device type are defined and combined with 16-bit hexadecimal number, which is called the IoT type identifier. Then, this IoT type identifier is reflected in generating EUI-64 for each IoT device. An IoT-specific IPv6 address is developed using the stateless address autoconfiguration with the network prefix and the modified EUI-64.</t>
