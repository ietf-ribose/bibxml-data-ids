      <t>Endpoint congestion avoidance and control mechanisms typically rely on measured network performance parameters such as the round-trip- time and packet loss seen by the receiver, without any explicit help from the network. Packet loss being the primary congestion indicator, these approaches first need to exceed the available network capacity to obtain the information needed to react. Additionally, relying on packet loss leads to misinterpretation of transmission errors as a sign of congestion.</t>
