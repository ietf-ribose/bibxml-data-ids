      <t>Endpoint congestion avoidance and control mechanisms typically relyon measured network performance parameters such as the round-trip-time and packet loss seen by the receiver, without any explicit helpfrom the network. Packet loss being the primary congestion indicator,these approaches first need to exceed the available network capacityto obtain the information needed to react. Additionally, relying onpacket loss leads to misinterpretation of transmission errors as asign of congestion.</t>
