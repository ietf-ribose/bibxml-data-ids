      <t>This document describes an extension of the Stateless IP/ICMP Translation for IPv6 Internet Data Centre Environments architecture (SIIT-DC), which allows applications, protocols, or nodes that are incompatible with IPv6, and/or Network Address Translation to operate correctly in an SIIT-DC environment. This is accomplished by introducing a new component called an SIIT-DC Edge Relay, which reverses the translations made by an SIIT-DC Border Relay. The application and/or node is thus provided with seemingly native IPv4 connectivity that provides end-to-end address transparency. The reader is expected to be familiar with the SIIT-DC architecture described in I-D.ietf-v6ops-siit-dc.</t>
