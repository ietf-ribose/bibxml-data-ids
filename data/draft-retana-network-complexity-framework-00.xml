      <t>Network architecture revolves around the concept of fitting the design of a network to its purpose; of asking the question, "what network will best fit these needs?" A part of fitting network design to requirements is the problem of complexity, an idea often measured by "seat of pants" methods. When would adding a particular protocol, policy, or configuration be "too complex?" This document suggests a series of continuums along which network complexity might be measured. No suggestions are made in measuring complexity for each of these continuums are provided; this is left for future documents.</t>
