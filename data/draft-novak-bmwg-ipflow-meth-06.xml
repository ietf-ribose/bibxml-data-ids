      <t>This document provides methodology and framework for quantifying performance impact of monitoring of IP flows on a network device and export of this information to a collector. It identifies the rate at which the IP flows are created, expired and exported as the performance metric. The metric is only applicable to the devices compliant with the Architecture for IP Flow Information Export [RFC5470].</t>
