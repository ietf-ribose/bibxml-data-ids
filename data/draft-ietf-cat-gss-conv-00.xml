      <t>Traditionally, the GSSAPI specification has not included in its scopethe acquisition of initial credentials, or mechanisms which haverequired interaction with the user in the course of the securitycontext. This has limited the applicability of the GSSAPIspecification.This specification allows an application program to register acallback function so that a GSSAPI mechanism can request conversationservices from the application program. The application program isresponsible for displaying messages to the user and requesting inputfrom the user via the callback function.The goal of this specification is to allow certain low-infrastructure-requiring mechanisms to prompt the user for ausername, password, SecureID response, etc. It might also be used bymechanisms such as Kerberos when the GSSAPI library wishes to obtaininitial credentials itself, instead of assuming that they are alreadypresent in the process.</t>
