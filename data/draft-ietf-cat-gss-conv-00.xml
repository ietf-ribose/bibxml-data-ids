      <t>Traditionally, the GSSAPI specification has not included in its scope the acquisition of initial credentials, or mechanisms which have required interaction with the user in the course of the security context. This has limited the applicability of the GSSAPI specification. This specification allows an application program to register a callback function so that a GSSAPI mechanism can request conversation services from the application program. The application program is responsible for displaying messages to the user and requesting input from the user via the callback function. The goal of this specification is to allow certain low- infrastructure-requiring mechanisms to prompt the user for a username, password, SecureID response, etc. It might also be used by mechanisms such as Kerberos when the GSSAPI library wishes to obtain initial credentials itself, instead of assuming that they are already present in the process.</t>
