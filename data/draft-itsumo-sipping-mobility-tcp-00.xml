      <t>This document proposes an approach for using SIP to support mobility for TCP-based applications in a mobile Internet. The proposed approach utilizes a TCP tracking agent, dubbed as SIP_EYE, in mobile stations as well as SIP INFO method to spoof constant endpoints for mobile TCP connections and supports mobile TCP applications in a SIP environment without any changes to TCP.</t>
