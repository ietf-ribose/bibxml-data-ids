      <t>Although the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) needs no special mechanism to enable network services and applications, in complex architectures, feature composition and service invocation become unmanageable without a mechanism for specifying the services that are associated with routes. This draft introduces distributed application architectures that span multiple administrative domains and proposes the use of ServiceCodes in SIP to allow service providers to compose chains of features across application servers.</t>
