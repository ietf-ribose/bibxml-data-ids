      <t>It is often useful for a single user to have multiple email addresses which can be used to assist categorizing incoming email. One way of doing this is to divide the local-part of an email address into user and detail parts. The user part is used to route the message within the specified domain and the detail part is used to route the message according to a particular user's wishes. This specification formalizes the de-facto standard for subaddressing in use today and includes advice and requirements for final delivery agents, MUAs and mail list servers which wish to support subaddressing.</t>
