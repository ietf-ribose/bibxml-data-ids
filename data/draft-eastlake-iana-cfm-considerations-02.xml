      <t>IEEE 802.1 has specified Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) facilities. CFM messages are structured with an OpCode field and have provision for the inclusion of TLV-structured information. IEEE 802.1 has allocated blocks of CFM OpCodes and TLV Types to the IETF. This document specifies the IANA considerations for the assignment of values from these blocks.</t>
