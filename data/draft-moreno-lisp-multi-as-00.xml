      <t>As multiple organizations interconnect their networks through peering agreements, it is desirable to preserve the services enabled by a LISP overlay over such interconnection of independent networks. This specification documents the requirements imposed by the deployment scenario in which multiple organizations federate their backbones with the objective of running a LISP overlay to enable services such as mobility or VPNs. The requirements for policies, enforcement and authoritative control of network assets are captured from the perspective of the operator.</t>
