      <t>This document specifies the way of discovering the NAT64 pools in use as well as DNS servers providing DNS64 service to the local clients. The discovery is done via SRV records, which also allows asignment of priorities to the NAT64 pools as well as DNS64 servers. It also allows clients to have diferent DNS providers than NAT64 provider, while providing a secure way via DNSSEC validation of provided SRV records. This way, it provides DNS64 service even in case where DNS over HTTPS is used.</t>
