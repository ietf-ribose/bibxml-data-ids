      <t>A number of protocols have been defined at the IETF to handle IPmobility and multi-homing - each of the defined protocols satisfies adifferent set of requirements - however, there is an overlap on someof the requirements and features among many of these protocols. Inpractice, a combination of the protocols are likely to be deployed ina system. There are various such combinations plausible, but somecombinations are more realistic than others. This document analyzesthe overall mobility and multi-homing architecture and highlightssome key points to consider while deploying an architectureconsisting of one or more of these protocols. The protocolsconsidered in scope for this document include Mobile IPv4 (MIPv4),Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6), Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6), Fast MobileIPv6 (FMIPv6), Network-based Local Mobility Management (NetLMM),MOBIKE, Host Identity Protocol (HIP), and Shim6.</t>
