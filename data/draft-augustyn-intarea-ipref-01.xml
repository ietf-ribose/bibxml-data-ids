      <t>This document describes IP addressing with references (referred to as IPREF) and how it can be used with IPv4 and IPv6. It uses special addresses called IPREF addresses which use references to IP addresses instead of actual addresses. IPREF provides highly scalable means of traversing private address spaces end-to-end. It can traverse private address spaces both within the same protocol domain and across protocol domains. For example, it allows NAT traversal for IPv4, or for IPv6 with NAT6 or filters. It also allows direct communication between IPv4 and IPv6 networks, including over NAT, NAT6, or filters. IPREF addresses are publishable via Domain Name System (DNS). Any host on any private network may publish its services via DNS. These services are reachable from any network, whether IPv4 or IPv6, provided IPREF is supported on both ends.</t>
