      <t>The work so far on Privacy Enhanced RTP Conferencing, which allows end-to-end security also in centralized switch RTP based conference, has not considered WebRTC in detail. This document looks at the use case of WebRTC based endpoints, it also considers implications of using external providers for both conference applications and centralized media distribution devices. From this a number of challenges have been determined, and requirements are derived from these. Finally the draft presents some straw man for possible solutions.</t>
