      <t>A number of competing methods for integrating legacy remote access user authentication into IPsec have been proposed, resulting in confusion as to which method(s) might be best for solving the problems at hand. This document briefly compares these proposals in an effort to clarify the relative standing of each with respect to the problem space and requirements.</t>
