      <t>Most of the message types defined by the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) make provision for optional trailing data. However, Route Monitoring messages (which provide a snapshot of the monitored Routing Information Base) and Peer Down messages (which indicate that a peering session was terminated) do not. Supporting optional data in TLV format across all BMP message types allows for a homogeneous and extensible surface that would be useful for the most different use-cases that need to convey additional data to a BMP station. While it is not intended for this document to cover any specific utilization scenario, it defines a simple way to support optional TLV data in all message types.</t>
