      <t>Software Defined Networks (SDN) provide a way to virtualize and abstract the network and presents the virtual/abstract resources to the third-party applications/software. The applications/software can, by the programmable interface or Northbound API, request, manipulate and monitor the services that the network provided. With this SDN capability, more innovative services can be introduced and rapidly deployed. Additionally, existing services can be deployed and managed in a much more simple way. This document outlines two use cases that leverage the SDN architecture/model to implement a kind of "self-help" and automated set of network services: Virtual Connection on Demand (VCoD) and Virtual Network on Demand (VNoD).</t>
