    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a scalable approach to name-based packet forwarding, a fundamental component of content semantic network architectures. Unlike IP-based forwarding, name-based forwarding must address the challenges of handling variable-length, unbounded keys and significantly larger namespaces. The proposed approach leverages two key insights to enable scalable forwarding for billions of prefixes. First, by representing names as binary strings, forwarding tables with millions of entries can be effectively compressed using Patricia tries to fit within contemporary line card memory. Second, the data structure is designed and optimized to ensure its size is dependent only on the number of rules, not the length of the rules themselves.</t>
