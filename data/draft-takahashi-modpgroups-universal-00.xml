      <t>This Internet Draft offers seven MODP ?Diffie-Hellman? groups whichcan be used in conjunction with other IETF standards to providesecurity for Internet communications. The groups are designed toallow implementers to use the same groups with different securityprotocols such as SMIME, SSH, TLS and IKE. The prime numbers whichform part of the definition of these groups are designed to allowfor fast, small signatures and be of the correct form for compliancewith standards bodies such as ANSI, NIST and the IEEE. This draftincludes groups with bit sizes of 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096, 6144, and8192. These may be used in addition to the groups already specifiedor in place of them. Since these groups are acceptable for all cryptographic applications involving the difficulty of discrete logarithms over GF(p) they are referred to as</t>
