      <t>This Internet Draft offers seven MODP ?Diffie-Hellman? groups which can be used in conjunction with other IETF standards to provide security for Internet communications. The groups are designed to allow implementers to use the same groups with different security protocols such as SMIME, SSH, TLS and IKE. The prime numbers which form part of the definition of these groups are designed to allow for fast, small signatures and be of the correct form for compliance with standards bodies such as ANSI, NIST and the IEEE. This draft includes groups with bit sizes of 1024, 2048, 3072, 4096, 6144, and 8192. These may be used in addition to the groups already specified or in place of them. Since these groups are acceptable for all cryptographic applications involving the difficulty of discrete logarithms over GF(p) they are referred to as</t>
