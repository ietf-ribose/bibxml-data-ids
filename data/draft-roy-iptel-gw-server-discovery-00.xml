      <t>This contribution describes a discovery protocol that can be used between gateways (GWs) and severs as well as among servers in intra- ITAD communications environment. The entities work in peer-to-peer mode to discover each other. A peer can find which peer(s) to register with based on policy. Each peer can also decide whether capabilities should also be taken into consideration during the discovery process before they proceed for registration. The discovery protocol will be a part for building a single unified intra-ITAD protocol described in a following contribution. The message formats of the intra-ITAD protocol including the discovery message are similar to TRIP.</t>
