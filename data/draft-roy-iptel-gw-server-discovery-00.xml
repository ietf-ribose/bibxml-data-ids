      <t>This contribution describes a discovery protocol that can be usedbetween gateways (GWs) and severs as well as among servers in intra-ITAD communications environment. The entities work in peer-to-peermode to discover each other. A peer can find which peer(s) toregister with based on policy. Each peer can also decide whethercapabilities should also be taken into consideration during thediscovery process before they proceed for registration. Thediscovery protocol will be a part for building a single unifiedintra-ITAD protocol described in a following contribution. Themessage formats of the intra-ITAD protocol including the discoverymessage are similar to TRIP.</t>
