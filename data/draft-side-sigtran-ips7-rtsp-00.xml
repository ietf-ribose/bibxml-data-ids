      <t>This document provides a functional description of the services providedby the Service Specific Connection Oriented Protocol (SSCOP) asdescribed in ITU Recommendation Q.2110. SSCOP performs connectioncontrol, transfer of variable length user data units, sequenceintegrity, error correction, and flow control functions to its users.These services are currently used to support the transport requirementsof signalling applications which require reliable, ordered, low-latencytransfer over large bandwidth paths. Although SSCOP is currentlydefined to transfer information between Layer 3 entities across theUNI and NNI using ATM virtual channels it may be possible to apply thesame concepts to provide transfer of information over UDP/IP.</t>
