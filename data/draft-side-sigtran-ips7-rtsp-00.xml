      <t>This document provides a functional description of the services provided by the Service Specific Connection Oriented Protocol (SSCOP) as described in ITU Recommendation Q.2110. SSCOP performs connection control, transfer of variable length user data units, sequence integrity, error correction, and flow control functions to its users. These services are currently used to support the transport requirements of signalling applications which require reliable, ordered, low-latency transfer over large bandwidth paths. Although SSCOP is currently defined to transfer information between Layer 3 entities across the UNI and NNI using ATM virtual channels it may be possible to apply the same concepts to provide transfer of information over UDP/IP.</t>
