    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a simple client/server model for supporting policy for RSVP, and is designed to be extensible so that other kinds of client types may be supported in the future. The model does not make any assumptions about the algorithm of the policy server, but is based on the server returning a single priority value in response to a policy request. The objective is to use this very basic model to begin policy experimentation.</t>
