      <t>The IETF's Transport Area Working Group (TSVWG) has finalized experimental RFCs for Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput (L4S) and new Non-Queue-Building (NQB) per hop behavior. These documents do a good job of describing a new architecture and protocol for deploying low latency networking. But as is normal for many such standards, especially those in experimental status, certain design decisions are ultimately left to implementers. This document explores the potential implications of key deployment design decisions and makes recommendations for those decisions that may help drive adoption.</t>
