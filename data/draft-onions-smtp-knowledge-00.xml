      <t>This memo describes a number of folklore issues associated with the SMTP protocol and attempts to tie down some loose ends. This document is an extension to RFC-821 and its extensions, not a replacement. This document is for information and does not set any standard. It indicates what is correct, what is pragmatic, and what is religious.</t>
