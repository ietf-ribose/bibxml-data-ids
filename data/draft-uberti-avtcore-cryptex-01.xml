    <abstract>
      <t>While the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) provides confidentiality for the contents of a media packet, a significant amount of metadata is left unprotected, including RTP header extensions and contributing sources (CSRCs). However, this data can be moderately sensitive in many applications. While there have been previous attempts to protect this data, they have had limited deployment, due to complexity as well as technical limitations. This document proposes a new mechanism to completely encrypt header extensions and CSRCs as well a simpler signaling mechanism intended to facilitate deployment.</t>
