      <t>This document presents a new, uniform method of mapping IP addresses, service identifiers and service-specific info. It does the ame work that is done by DNS and URLs. I realize this would be extremally hard to implement, as there is already an immense working base of DNS, but the idea provides so much benefits that I thought I did not have the right not to post it (so maybe the URN folks use it for something).</t>
