      <t>TCP-ENO negotiates encryption at the transport layer. It also defines a few parameters that are intended to be used or configured by applications. This document specifies operating system interfaces for access to these TCP-ENO parameters. We describe the interfaces in terms of socket options, the de facto standard API for adjusting per-connection behavior in TCP/IP, and sysctl, a popular mechanism for setting global defaults. Operating systems that lack socket or sysctl functionality can implement similar interfaces in their native frameworks, but should ideally adapt their interfaces from those presented in this document.</t>
