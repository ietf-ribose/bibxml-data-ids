    <abstract>
      <t>This OAuth 2.0 authorization flow for browserless and input- constrained devices, often referred to as the device flow, enables OAuth clients to request user authorization from devices that have an Internet connection, but don't have an easy input method (such as a smart TV, media console, picture frame, or printer), or lack a suitable browser for a more traditional OAuth flow. This authorization flow instructs the user to perform the authorization request on a secondary device, such as a smartphone. There is no requirement for communication between the constrained device and the user's secondary device.</t>
