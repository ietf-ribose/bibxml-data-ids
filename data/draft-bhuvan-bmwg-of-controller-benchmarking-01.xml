    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the metrics and methodologies for measuring performance of SDN controllers. SDN controllers have been implemented with many varying designs, in order to achieve their intended network functionality. Hence, in this document the authors take the approach of considering an SDN controller as a black box, defining the metrics in a manner that is agnostic to protocols and network services supported by controllers. The intent of this document is to provide a standard mechanism to measure the performance of all controller implementations.</t>
