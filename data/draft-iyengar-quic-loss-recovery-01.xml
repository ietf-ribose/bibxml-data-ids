      <t>QUIC is a new multiplexed and secure transport atop UDP. QUIC builds on decades of transport and security experience, and implements mechanisms that make it attractive as a modern general-purpose transport. QUIC implements the spirit of known TCP loss detection mechanisms, described in RFCs, various Internet-drafts, and also those prevalent in the Linux TCP implementation. This document describes QUIC loss detection and congestion control, and attributes the TCP equivalent in RFCs, Internet-drafts, academic papers, and TCP implementations.</t>
