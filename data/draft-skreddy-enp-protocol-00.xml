      <t>As the complexity of distributed applications increases, anincreasing amount of processing is done using distributed processes,which typically execute without the direct supervision of an enduser. The user must poll these processes periodically to check ifthey are completed successfully or not. This polling results inunnecessary wastage of network bandwidth as well as computingresources. The user generally cannot see intermediate results orprogress reports for long running processes, they must wait till theprocess is completely finished before viewing the results.Thus the problem of monitoring events is central in distributedapplications and protocols. A repeated need in such applications isreceive notifications when a resource property value changes orevent state changes. Current database systems provides mechanismslike constraints, triggers and active database rules. Thesefacilities provides an automated means to ensure the databaseintegrity or perform specific action when data changes. Need forsuch kind of requirement is fundamental is network applications</t>
