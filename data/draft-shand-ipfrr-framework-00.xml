      <t>This document provides a framework for the development of IP fast re- route mechanisms which provide protection against link or router failure by invoking locally determined repair paths. Unlike MPLS Fast-reroute, the mechanisms are applicable to a network employing conventional IP routing and forwarding. An essential part of such mechanisms is the prevention of packet loss caused by the loops which normally occur during the re-convergence of the network following a failure.</t>
