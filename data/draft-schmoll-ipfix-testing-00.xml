      <t>This document presents a list of tests which implementers of IP FlowInformation Export (IPFIX) compliant systems are encouraged toperform on their IPFIX system. This document has been created tohelp implementers test the functionality of their IPFIX exporterand/or collector component. The goal of these tests is to ensurethat all important functions are covered by tests and thereby to gaina level of confidence in the system which allows the implementer toperform interoperabilty or plug tests with other IPFIX systems.</t>
