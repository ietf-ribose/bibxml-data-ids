      <t>[1] describes a mechanism for BGP that would help minimize the negative effects on routing caused by BGP restart. This document extends this mechanism to also minimize the negative effects on MPLS forwarding when BGP is used to carry MPLS labels [2]. The mechanism described in this document is agnostic with respect to the types of the addresses carried in the BGP NLRI. As such it works in conjunction with any of the address famililies that could be carried in BGP (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, etc...)</t>
