      <t>[1] describes a mechanism for BGP that would help minimize thenegative effects on routing caused by BGP restart. This documentextends this mechanism to also minimize the negative effects on MPLSforwarding when BGP is used to carry MPLS labels [2]. The mechanismdescribed in this document is agnostic with respect to the types ofthe addresses carried in the BGP NLRI. As such it works inconjunction with any of the address famililies that could be carriedin BGP (e.g., IPv4, IPv6, etc...)</t>
