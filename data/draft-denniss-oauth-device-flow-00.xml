      <t>The device flow is suitable for OAuth 2.0 clients executing on devices which do not have an easy data-entry method (e.g., game consoles, TVs, picture frames, and media hubs), but where the end- user has separate access to a user-agent on another computer or device (e.g., desktop computer, a laptop, a smart phone, or a tablet). Note: This version of the document is a continuation of an earlier, long expired draft. The content of the expired draft has been copied almost unmodified. The goal of the work on this document is to capture deployment experience.</t>
