      <t>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting qualityof service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. Theoverall PCN architecture is described in RFC5559. This memo is oneof a series describing possible boundary node behaviours for a PCNdomain.This document proposes an admission control method. It assumes thatPCN nodes perform threshold-marking configured with the PCN-admissible-rate on any link. The decision point uses the PCN markingstate of an initial signaling message of a flow to determine whetherthe flow should be admitted or blocked.</t>
