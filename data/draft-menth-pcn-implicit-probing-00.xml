      <t>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting quality of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. The overall PCN architecture is described in RFC5559. This memo is one of a series describing possible boundary node behaviours for a PCN domain. This document proposes an admission control method. It assumes that PCN nodes perform threshold-marking configured with the PCN- admissible-rate on any link. The decision point uses the PCN marking state of an initial signaling message of a flow to determine whether the flow should be admitted or blocked.</t>
