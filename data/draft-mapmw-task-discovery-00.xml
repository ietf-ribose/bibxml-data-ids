    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an architectural framework for an open, interoperable ecosystem in which task owners publish tasks—represented as structured task cards—to a task-posting platform, enabling autonomous agents to discover tasks, negotiate execution terms, and coordinate multi-agent collaboration. The architecture introduces a set of functional layers—including the Task Owner Layer, Task Owner Access Layer, Task-Posting Platform, Agentic Layer, Agent Access Layer, and an optional Communication Link—that collectively support secure task publication, agent discovery, capability evaluation, and bilateral negotiation. The framework is designed to accommodate heterogeneous agents with diverse skill sets, trust requirements, and operational models, while ensuring consistent interaction patterns across platforms and vendors. The document also surveys existing agent-discovery approaches, such as A2A, agntcy/OASF, ARDP, and DNS-AID, and identifies gaps that motivate a unified, interoperable model for task-centric and agent-initiated discovery and interaction. It also explores possible ways by which the current approached can enhance the proposed framework. The goal of this architecture is not to replace existing mechanisms but to provide a complementary framework that enables agent–task interactions in scenarios that are difficult to support using traditional agent-to-agent or platform-centric interaction models. The document is concluded with some potential standardization venues for the IETF.</t>
