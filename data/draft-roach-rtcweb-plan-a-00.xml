      <t>A recurrent theme in WebRTC has been the need to handle very large numbers of media flows. Unfortunately, naive uses of SDP do not handle this case particularly well. This document describes a modest set of extensions to SDP which allow it to cleanly handle arbitrary numbers of flows while still retaining a large degree of backward compatibility with existing and non-RTCWEB endpoints.</t>
