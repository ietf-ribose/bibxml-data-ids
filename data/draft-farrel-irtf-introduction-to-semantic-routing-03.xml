      <t>Many proposals have been made to add semantics to IP packets by placing additional information in existing fields, by adding semantics to IP addresses themselves, or by adding fields. The intent is to facilitate enhanced routing/forwarding decisions based on these additional semantics to provide differentiated forwarding paths for different packet flows distinct from simple shortest path first routing. The process is defined as Semantic Routing. This document provides a brief introduction to Semantic Routing.</t>
