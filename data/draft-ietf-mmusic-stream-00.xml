      <t>This strawman proposal presents a revised version of the RTSP proposal put forward to the MMUSIC group, borrowing liberally from the original. The Real Time Streaming Protocol, or RTSP, is an application-level protocol for control over the delivery of data with real-time properties. RTSP provides an extensible framework to enable controlled, on-demand delivery of real- time data, such as audio and video. Sources of data can include both live data feeds and stored clips. This protocol is intended to control multiple data delivery sessions, provide a means for choosing delivery channels such as UDP, multicast UDP and TCP, and delivery mechanisms based upon RTP (RFC 1889).</t>
