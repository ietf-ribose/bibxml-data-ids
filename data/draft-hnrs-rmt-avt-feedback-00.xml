      <t>When distributing information through multicast, it is often neccessary to solicit feedback from receivers. This feedback can be to report on reception quality, indicate loss of packets, or acknowledge receipt of data. There is a range of feedback mechanisms possible, ranging from polling to periodic multicast feedback. This document presents a taxonomy of these various mechanisms, with a discussion of the pros and cons of each approach and a discussion of applicability.</t>
