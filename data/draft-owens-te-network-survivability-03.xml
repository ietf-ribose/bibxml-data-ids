      <t>Network survivability refers to the capability of the network to maintain service continuity in the presence of faults within the network [1]. This can be accomplished by recovering quickly from network failures quickly and maintaining the required QoS for existing services. With the increasing sophistication of network technologies, survivability capabilities are becoming available at multiple layers, allowing for protection and restoration to occur at any layer of the network. This makes it important to: scrutinize the recovery features of different network layers, understand the pros and cons of performing recovery at each layer, and assess how the interactions between layers impact network survivability. With these objectives in mind, this draft examines the considerations for network survivability at different layers of the network.</t>
