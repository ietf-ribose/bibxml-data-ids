    <abstract>
      <t>We present a novel architecture for providing reliable multicast transport service over the existing Internet protocol stack. This protocol stack ordinarily supports reliable unicast transport layer (TCP) connections over a network layer (IP) which is capable of providing an unreliable multicasting service. We propose the addition of a new Single Connection Emulation (SCE) sublayer between TCP and multicast IP. This added layer mimics the single destination network layer interface to TCP and interfaces with multicast IP to provide the necessary multicast functionality. The new architecture also enables interactions between applications and the SCE, thus allowing the applications to control the semantics of the reliable multicast connection. We discuss the design issues that need to be considered when such a sublayer is to be introduced. A set of specifications for implementing the SCE is presented. We also describe an implementation of this new approach on a BSD-based system.</t>
