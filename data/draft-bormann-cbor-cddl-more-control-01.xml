    <abstract>
      <t>The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), standardized in RFC 8610, provides "control operators" as its main language extension point. RFCs have added to this extension point both in an application-specific and a more general way. The present document defines a number of additional generally application control operators for text conversion (Bytes, Integers, JSON), operations on text, and deterministic encoding. // Revision -01 of this draft reflects comments from initial // discussion of the specification in the CBOR working group. It is // intended to be ready for working group adoption.</t>
