      <t>The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) used for the World Wide Web (Web PKI) is a vital component of trust in the Internet. In recent years, there have been a number of improvements made to this infrastructure, including improved certificate status checking, automation, and transparency of governance. However, additional improvements are necessary. This document identifies continuing areas of concern and provides recommendations to the Internet community for additional improvements, moving toward a more robust and secure Web PKI.</t>
