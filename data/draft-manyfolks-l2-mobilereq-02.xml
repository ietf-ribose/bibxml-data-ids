      <t>A critical factor in achieving good performance for IP mobility protocols is the design of L2 handover. Handover occurs when a Mobile Node moves from one radio Access Point to another. If the new radio Access Point is associated with a new subnet, a change in routing reachability may occur and require L3 protocol action on the part of the Mobile Node or Access Routers. If no change in subnet occurs, the Access Point may still need to take some action to inform the Access Router about a change in on-link reachability. In either case, prompt and timely information from L2 to the parties involved about the sequencing of handover can help optimize handover at the IP level. This draft discusses requirements for an L2 handover protocol or API to support optimized handover.</t>
