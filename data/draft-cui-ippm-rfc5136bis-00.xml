      <t>This document defines the metric of network capacity, including linkcapacity aspect, router capacity aspect and path capacity aspect.RFC5136 has defined link capacity and path capacity, where the routerimpact is implicitly considered in link capacity. However, in thisdocument, router capacity is considerred as a separate factor of pathcapacity, no longer a factor of link capacity. This documentexplicitly describes the router capacity and its impact to networkcapacity, e.g. how to evaluate path capacity.This document is derived from RFC5136 and obsoletes RFC5136.</t>
