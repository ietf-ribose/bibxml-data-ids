      <t>This document specifies an update of TLS 1.2 for long-term support on systems that can have multi-year or even decade-long update cycles, one that incoporates as far as possible what's already deployed for TLS 1.2 but with the security holes and bugs fixed. This document also recognises the fact that there is a huge amount of TLS use outside the web content-delivery environment with its resource-rich hardware and software that can be updated whenever required and provides a long-term stable, known-good version that can be deployed to systems that can't roll out ongoing changes on a continuous basis.</t>
