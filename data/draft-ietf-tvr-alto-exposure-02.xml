      <t>Time-Variant Routing (TVR) involves predictable, scheduled changes to network topology elements such as nodes, links, and adjacencies that impact routing behavior over time. All those changes can alter the connectivity in the network in a predictable manner, which is known as Time-Variant Routing (TVR). This document proposes mechanisms for exposing TVR information to both internal and external applications, focusing on off-path solutions that decouple the advertisement of scheduled changes from the routing control plane signaling.</t>
