    <abstract>
      <t>Bluetooth protocol suite defines a set of security mechanisms between its devices. All the authentication procedure is based on the knowledge of a shared secret called PIN. Bluetooth suggests to use systems such as Diffie-Hellman method or others else to initiate the PIN between two unknown devices. This draft proposes a simple mechanism that help two entities already presented to an AAA infrastructure share the PIN and start secured Bluetooth communications with Bluetooth Security protocols.</t>
