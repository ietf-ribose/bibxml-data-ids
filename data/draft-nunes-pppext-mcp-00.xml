      <t>This document defines the encapsulation and mechanisms that allows PPP packets to be transported over low-bitrate links such as modem lines, ISDN B-channels, and sub-T1 links with guarantee of quality of service for time sensitive services. A mechanism of channel preemption is defined, allowing the immediate occupation of the channel with the most priority packet, resuming the transmission of the lower priority frame without need to retransmit the octets already sent. This mechanism allows a dynamic packet fragmentation, guaranteeing simultaneously a low transmission delay for the services more sensitive to transmission delays and an efficient channel occupation. It is a recursive mechanism, which means that the packet that made the channel preemption can itself be preempted by another higher priority packet, and this process can be repeated whenever a higher priority packet requests transmission. The proposed mechanism is compatible with existing hardware and drivers for asynchronous and synchronous HDLC controllers.</t>
