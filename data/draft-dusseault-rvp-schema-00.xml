      <t>The RVP protocol [2] can be used to query properties of objects, subscribe to certain kinds of events, and send instant messages to objects. These objects are often users, but there are other classes of objects as well. A schema needs to be defined which applies to all kinds of RVP objects, as well as more detailed schemas for the most commonly used objects, users and groups. The required properties for all RVP objects include common name (Cn), schema type and access control list. The required properties for a user object, which represents a single human user of the system, include status, status message, email address and directory server address. The required properties for a group object, which represents a list of objects which may be messaged all at once by messaging this group, include member- count and owner.</t>
