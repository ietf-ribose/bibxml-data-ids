      <t>This document describes the requirements and desired properties of Network Mobility (NEMO) Route Optimization techniques for use in global-networked communications systems for aeronautics and space exploration. Substantial input to these requirements was given by aeronautical communications experts outside the IETF, including members of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and other aeronautical communications standards bodies. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>
