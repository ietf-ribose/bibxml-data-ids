    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a header compression scheme and fragmentation functionality for IPv6/UDP protocols. These techniques are especially tailored for LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) networks and could be extended to other protocol stacks. The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) offers a great level of flexibility when processing the header fields. Static context means that information stored in the context which, describes field values, does not change during the packet transmission, avoiding complex resynchronization mechanisms, incompatible with LPWAN characteristics. In most of the cases, IPv6/UDP headers are reduced to a small identifier. This document describes the generic compression/decompression process and applies it to IPv6/UDP headers. Similar mechanisms for other protocols such as CoAP will be described in a separate document. Moreover, this document specifies fragmentation and reassembly mechanims for SCHC compressed packets exceeding the L2 pdu size and for the case where the SCHC compression is not possible then the IPv6/UDP packet is sent.</t>
