      <t>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol is designed to allow entities with knowledge about the network infrastructure to export such information to applications, with the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving application performance. This document provides a framework that contains data structures, configurations, and message templates, to test the functionality and interoperability of an ALTO client and an ALTO server.</t>
