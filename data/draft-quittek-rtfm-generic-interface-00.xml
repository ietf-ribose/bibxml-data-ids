      <t>This memo specifies a high-level application-oriented interface tothe Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM) Architecture. Theabstract interface models the RTFM architecture while hiding many ofthe details not relevant to an application programmer who want tointegrate IP traffic measurements into an application. Particularlythe interaction between manager, reader, and meter is hidden by theinterface, and rule sets used for traffic measurement specificationare replaced by simpler data structures. Furthermore, the RTFMinterface supports complex actions like modifying a trafficmeasurement specification while it is already being applied. Theinterface is defined in an abstract way. It can be implemented by anapplication programming interface as well as by a network protocol.</t>
