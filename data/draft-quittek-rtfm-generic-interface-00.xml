      <t>This memo specifies a high-level application-oriented interface to the Realtime Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM) Architecture. The abstract interface models the RTFM architecture while hiding many of the details not relevant to an application programmer who want to integrate IP traffic measurements into an application. Particularly the interaction between manager, reader, and meter is hidden by the interface, and rule sets used for traffic measurement specification are replaced by simpler data structures. Furthermore, the RTFM interface supports complex actions like modifying a traffic measurement specification while it is already being applied. The interface is defined in an abstract way. It can be implemented by an application programming interface as well as by a network protocol.</t>
