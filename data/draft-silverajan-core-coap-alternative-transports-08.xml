      <t>CoAP has been standardised as an application level REST-based protocol. A single CoAP message is typically encapsulated and transmitted using UDP or DTLS as transports. These transports are optimal solutions for CoAP use in IP-based constrained environments and nodes. However compelling motivation exists for allowing CoAP to operate with other transports and protocols. Examples are M2M communication in cellular networks using SMS, more suitable transport protocols for firewall/NAT traversal, end-to-end reliability and security such as TCP and TLS, or employing proxying and tunneling gateway techniques such as the WebSocket protocol. This draft examines the requirements for conveying CoAP messages to end points over such alternative transports. It also provides a new URI format for representing CoAP resources over alternative transports.</t>
