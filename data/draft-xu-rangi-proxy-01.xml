      <t>The Routing Architecture for the Next Generation Internet (RANGI) described in [RANGI] is a proposal for solving routing scalability, mobility, multihoming, traffic engineering and other issues facing the current Internet. This document describes some transition mechanisms for the RANGI. With these mechanisms, legacy IPv4 and IPv6 hosts can communicate with RANGI hosts, and vice versa.</t>
