      <t>In the DNS architecture, two kinds of record types for maintaininghost's IP addresses are supported: one is A type which records IPv4and AAAA for IPv6 addresses. This document defines a new TYPE, whichis mainly used in queries in order to get both IPv4 and IPv6addresses. The main advantage is to avoid sending several requestsin order to resolve the location of a given resource. A singlerequest may be sufficient. The proposed solution does not requirethe definition of any new record type.</t>
