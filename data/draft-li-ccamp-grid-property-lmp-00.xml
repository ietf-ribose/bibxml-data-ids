      <t>The recent updated version of ITU-T [G.694.1] has introduced the flexible grid DWDM technique which provides a new tool that operators can implement to provide a higher degree of network optimization than is possible with fixed grid systems. This document describes the extensions to the Link management protocol (LMP) to negotiate link grid property between the adjacent DWDM nodes before the link is brought up.</t>
