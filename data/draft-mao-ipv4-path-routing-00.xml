      <t>This document describes a solution to the IPv4 address shortage problem. The solution is to be implemented within the IPv4 framework, rather than inside a "next generation" IP protocol. By organizing local networks as an "intranet hierarchy" attached to the Internet, nodes inside the hierarchy can be uniquely addressed with path descriptions. Two IPv4 options, Source-Side Path-info and Destination-Side Path-info, are added into the IPv4 protocol, so that up to 2 path descriptions can be carried in the IPv4 header. Further, a currently unused flag bit in the IPv4 header is used to extend the logical IPv4 header, so that options can also be carried "out-band". Core routers in the Internet will ignore the unrecognized new options and the extension, and thus need not be replaced or updated.</t>
