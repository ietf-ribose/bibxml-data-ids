    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a solution for point-to-multipoint (P2MP) Traffic Engineering (TE) which extends 'RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels', RFC 3209, and 'Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions', RFC 3473, to support P2MP TE LSPs. A P2MP TE LSP is established by setting up multiple standard point- to-point (P2P) TE LSPs from a sender node and all the downstream branch nodes along the P2P TE LSP to one of the leaf nodes of the P2MP TE LSP. A branched LSP is associated with original trunk LSP by newly defined Association object so that the P2MP LSP tunnel is established over the P2MP path. Because only a single standard LSP will be present on any given link along the P2MP LSP, the defined approach realizes maximum compatibility with existing implementations. The solution supports standard tree operations: setup, graft/join, and prune/leave. As the (G)MPLS signaling is used, the P2MP TE LSP can be built using any switching technology supported by GMPLS. This includes non-packet technologies.</t>
