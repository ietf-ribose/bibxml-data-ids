    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines a new extensibility point to OAuth 2.0 which allows clients to identify through different methods to an authorization server using an identifier not assigned or managed by the authorization server. Beyond this general extensibility point, the specification defines one client ID scheme "urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-id-scheme:oauth-discoverable-client", including the nessary rules around how the client makes its metadata available for an authorization server and how an authorization server can obtain this metadata without the need for a registration process.</t>
