      <t>This document is one of two reports on the Integrated ISIS protocol. The other report documents operational experience with the protocol. These two reports are required by the IAB/IESG in order for an Internet routing protocol to advance to Draft Standard Status. Integrated ISIS is an Interior Gateway Protocol and is designed to carry both IP and ISO CLNP routing information. Integrated ISIS is currently designated as a Proposed Standard. The protocol was first published in RFC 1195. Internet Draft [2] was published subsequently to RFC 1195 and documents the current version of the protocol. This report summarizes the key features of Integrated ISIS. It also attempts to analyze how the protocol will perform and scale in the Internet. Please send comments to isis@merit.edu.</t>
