    <abstract>
      <t>This memo defines a profile of the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol by which the owner of an identifier (e.g., a domain name) can allow a third party to obtain an X.509 certificate such that the certificate subject is the delegated identifier while the certified public key corresponds to a private key controlled by the third party. A primary use case is that of a Content Delivery Network (CDN, the third party) terminating TLS sessions on behalf of a content provider (the owner of a domain name). The presented mechanism allows the owner of the identifier to retain control over the delegation and revoke it at any time. A key property of this mechanism is it does not require any modification to the deployed TLS ecosystem.</t>
