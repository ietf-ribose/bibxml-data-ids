    <abstract>
      <t>This specification entails enabling power and performance management in Routers (multi-chassis and single chassis) with respect to TCAM and SRAM usage on intelligent router line cards that implement Virtual Aggregation of routes. The previous version of this document had several errata that have been addressed in this version. This scheme relates to unicast alone since multicast entries are programmed only after consultation with the unicast entries in the software plane in the Route processor. Hence this scheme does not apply to multicast.</t>
