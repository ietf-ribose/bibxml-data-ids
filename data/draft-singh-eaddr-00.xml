      <t>ENUM uses NAPTR DNS Resource Records (RRs) to map an E.164 telephone number to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) of other ways of contacting (for example, by email) a specific resource. This memo proposes an ENUM-like service called EADDR where an email address, instead of a telephone number, is used as the key to fetch other contact URIs. At human level, EADDR seems more useful than ENUM because it is easier to remember an email address than a telephone number as the key. At machine level, both services are equally useful.</t>
