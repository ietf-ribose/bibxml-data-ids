      <t>ENUM uses NAPTR DNS Resource Records (RRs) to map an E.164 telephonenumber to Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) of other ways ofcontacting (for example, by email) a specific resource. This memoproposes an ENUM-like service called EADDR where an email address,instead of a telephone number, is used as the key to fetch othercontact URIs. At human level, EADDR seems more useful than ENUMbecause it is easier to remember an email address than a telephonenumber as the key. At machine level, both services are equallyuseful.</t>
