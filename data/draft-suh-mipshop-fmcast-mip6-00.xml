      <t>This document defines the Fast Multicast Protocol for Mobile IPv6 [2] in the Fast Handovers environments whereby a mobile node (MN) can receive multicast data with reduced loss and delay after handoffs. The proposed protocol can be implemented by the simple modification of the Fast Handovers protocol [1] so that it can be easily applied to the Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6. This document does not need a certain assumption of a specific multicast routing protocol, so that any existing multicast routing protocol can be used with the proposed protocol.</t>
