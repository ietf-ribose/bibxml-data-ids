      <t>This document lists logging capabilities originally defined in RFC3871 and needed to support the current practices, including those described in the Operational Security Current Practices document[CURPRAC] Logging is defined as the delivery to another entity or system of messages about the device, the data passing through the device, or the device's interaction with another device. Capabilities are defined without reference to specific technologies. This is done to leave room for deployment of new technologies that implement the capability. Each capability cites the practices it supports. Current implementations that support the capability are cited. Special considerations are discussed as appropriate listing operational and resource constraints, limitations of current implementations, trade offs, etc.</t>
