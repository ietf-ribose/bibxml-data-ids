      <t>This memo defines directory information profiles for representing directory distribution knowledge for an X.500 or LDAP directory system, to be carried in an application/directory MIME Content-Type. The profiles consists of type definitions and the corresponding format of values that each type is allowed to contain. They are designed for simple generation and parsing by programs; the text-based format makes it easier for developers and directory administrators to debug problems. Additional documents will build on these specifications in defining text-based protocols for distributed directory server administration.</t>
