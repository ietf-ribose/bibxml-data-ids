      <t>XCAST6 (Explicit Multiunicast on IPv6) is a new protocol defined inRFC 5058. In XCAST, the list of destinations is explicitly encodedwithin the data packets instead of using a multicast group address.Research is currently ongoing on two versions of XCAST6 and thisdocument describes the design and implementation of a routing enginefor the new version in which the use of hop-by-hop options header hasbeen eliminated. This draft explains why there is a need for anXCAST6 routing engine, highlights the requirements for itsimplementation, the design process and how to eventually implementthe routing engine to allow for deployment of XCAST6 protocol.Conventions used in this documentThe key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALLNOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" inthis document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119[RFC2119].</t>
