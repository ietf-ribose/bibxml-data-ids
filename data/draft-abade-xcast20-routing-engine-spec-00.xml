      <t>XCAST6 (Explicit Multiunicast on IPv6) is a new protocol defined in RFC 5058. In XCAST, the list of destinations is explicitly encoded within the data packets instead of using a multicast group address. Research is currently ongoing on two versions of XCAST6 and this document describes the design and implementation of a routing engine for the new version in which the use of hop-by-hop options header has been eliminated. This draft explains why there is a need for an XCAST6 routing engine, highlights the requirements for its implementation, the design process and how to eventually implement the routing engine to allow for deployment of XCAST6 protocol. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].</t>
