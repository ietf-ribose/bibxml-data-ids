      <t>This draft describes the operational and administrative considerations encountered as part of the migration from a traditional Domain Name Service (DNS) infrastructure to one based on DNS Security (DNSSEC). The information presented in this draft is based on the implementation of DNSSEC in the Collaborative Advanced Inter-agency Research Network (CAIRN) testbed. CAIRN is a DARPA funded testbed used by Government, University, and Commercial researchers to conduct Internet Protocol (IP) network based research. Additional information on the CAIRN testbed is available at http://www.cairn.net. Details on the DNSSEC implementation in CAIRN can be found at http://www.cairn.net/DNSSEC. It is envisioned that the information presented in this draft can be used as a starting reference for sites interested in deploying DNSSEC. It is also hoped that reporting on the experience of CAIRN DNSSEC implementation will provide a forum for general discussions regarding DNSSEC implementation.</t>
