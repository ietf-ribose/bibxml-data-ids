      <t>Routing and routing functions in enterprise and carrier networks are typically performed by network devices (routers and switches) using a routing information base (RIB). Protocols and configuration collectively push data into RIB and the RIB manager installs state information into the hardware; for packet forwarding. This draft specifies a data model for the RIB in order to define and enable a standardized data model. Such a data model can be used to define an interface to the RIB by using an entity that may even be external to the network device. This interface can be used to support new use- cases being defined by the IETF I2RS WG. This document introduces a yang data for I2RS RIB that aligns with the I2RS RIB use cases and I2RS RIB infomation model.</t>
