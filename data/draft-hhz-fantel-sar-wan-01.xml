    <abstract>
      <t>This document introduces the main scenarios related to AI services in WAN, as well as their requirements for FANTEL (FAst Notification for Traffic Engineering and Load balancing) in these scenarios. Traditional network management mechanisms are often constrained by slow feedback and high overhead, limiting their ability to react quickly to sudden link failures, congestion, or load imbalances. Therefore, these AI services need FANTEL to provide real-time and proactive notifications for traffic engineering and load balancing, meeting the requirements of ultra-high throughput and lossless data transmission.</t>
