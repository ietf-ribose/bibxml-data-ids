    <abstract>
      <t>The proposal specifies a means for NTP instances that can establish a TCP connection between themselves to create secure ephemeral keys. With the known weaknesses of the public-key security protocol, Autokey, which is defined by RFC 5906 [RFC5906], a replacement for Autokey that supports at least Client/Server and Symmetric modes must be provided.</t>
