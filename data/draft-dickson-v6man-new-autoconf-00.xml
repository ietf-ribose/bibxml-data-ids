      <t>This Internet Draft discusses a proposed extension to the set ofInterface Identifier construction methods for 802 networks. Thepurpose of this is to allow autoconf RA announcments of prefix lengthother than 64 bits. It is intended to be fully backward compatiblefor /64 announcements. Instead of having one Interface Identifierconstruction method for all purposes, this adds an alternate methodwhich is only used for autoconf, and only if the prefix length is not/64. No other IPv6 methods or protocols require modification.However, without modification, use of prefixes other than /64 likelywon't support many IPv6 enhanced functions.The ultimate goal it providing enough bits between the top levelallocation by Regional Internet Registristry (RIR) and the smallestautoconfiguration allocation, to allow both external aggregation byISPs into one prefix, as well as internal hierarchical aggregation tosupport a variety of ISP topologies and practices. Current policiesare driven from below by the current 64 bit Interface Identifier.Only by relaxing this to 48 bits for such technologies as 802(Ethernet), does the number of bits available reach a level deemed"sufficient".Author's NoteThis Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft or a relateddraft(s) being placed on the Standards Track for 6man.The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in [5].</t>
