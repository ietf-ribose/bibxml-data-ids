    <abstract>
      <t>The Remote Authentication Dial-In User Server (RADIUS) Protocol can use the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and the Transport Control Protocol (TCP) as its underlying transport layer. But it permits TCP to be used as a transport protocol for RADIUS only when a transport layer such as TLS or IPsec provides confidentiality and security. QUIC inherently supports encryption (using TLS 1.3), which could provide a higher level of security. And QUIC supports multiple streams over a single connection, enhancing throughput and efficiency. This document defines RADIUS over the QUIC transport protocol, named RADIUSoQUIC.</t>
