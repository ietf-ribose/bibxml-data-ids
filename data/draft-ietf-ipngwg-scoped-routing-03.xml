      <t>This document outlines a mechanism for generating forwarding tables that include scoped IPv6 addresses. It defines a set of rules for routers to implement in order to forward packets addressed to scoped unicast or multicast addresses regardless of the routing protocol. These rules apply to all scoped addresses.</t>
