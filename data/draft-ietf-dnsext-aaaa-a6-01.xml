      <t>At this moment, there are two DNS resource record types defined for holding IPv6 address in the DNS database; AAAA [Thomson, 1995] and A6 [Crawford, 2000]. AAAA has been used for IPv6 network operation since 1996. Questions arose whether we really need A6 or not, or whether it is really possible to migrate to A6 or not. Some says AAAA is enough and A6 is not necessary. Some says A6 is necessary and AAAA should get deprecated.</t>
