      <t>This document describes the architecture of Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) Service Function Chaining (SFC) with SR-aware functions. This architecture provides the following benefits: * Comprehensive Management: a centralized controller for SFC, handling SR Policy, link-state, and network metrics. * Simplicity: no SFC proxies, so that reduces nodes and address resource consumption.
