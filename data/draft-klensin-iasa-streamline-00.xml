      <t>There have been many opportunities to examine the functioning of the IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) since its creation in 2005 and the subsequent addition of the IETF Trust to its scope. Suggestions to do so have generally not progressed, in part because of constraints imposed by the IETF Trust. Those constraints have now expired.

This document proposes to change the workload requirements.</t>
