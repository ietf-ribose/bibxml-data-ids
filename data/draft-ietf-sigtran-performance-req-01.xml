      <t>This document serves as input into the IETF SIGTRAN requirements process. It includes call setup delay requirements, derived from relevant ISDN and SS7 standards published by ITU-T (International Telecommunications Union--Telecommunications Standardization Sector) and generic requirements published by Telcordia Technologies (formerly Bellcore). To gain user acceptance of Voice-over-IP (VoIP) services and to enable interoperability between Switched Circuit Networks (SCNs) and VoIP systems, it is imperative that the VoIP signaling performance be comparable to that of the current SCNs. The requirements given in this Internet Draft are intended to be the worst-case requirements, for at least in the United States SCN calls are typically set up at a faster speed than the derived requirements. At the end of the draft, several VoIP call connection scenarios based on the latest megaco protocol are analyzed and compared with similar cases in the PSTN. It indicates the PDD performance of VoIP systems is somewhat worst but not by much. An improvement in some network element can bring VoIP systems to have comparable PDD performance as the PSTN.</t>
