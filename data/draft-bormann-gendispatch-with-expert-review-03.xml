    <abstract>
      <t>This document updates RFC 8126, adding registry policies that augment an existing policy that is based on a review body action with the additional requirement for a Designated Expert review. It also updates RFC 7120 with the necessary process to perform early allocations for registries with one of the augmented policies. To support its objectives for the period of time while the above updates have not yet been finalized, this document offers text that can be copy-pasted into specifications that want to make use of the augmented policies. // —— Editors' note: —— As to augmenting existing policies, the // provided proposals have been considered in // [I-D.baber-ianabis-rfc8126bis] within the IANABIS Working Group. // This topic is covered by Section 2 of our draft and there is a // placeholder "ADD NEW PROCEDURE" about it at Section 4 of // [I-D.baber-ianabis-rfc8126bis]. However, compared to our draft, // this is not augmenting the policy "IESG Approval". On the topic // of early registration covered by Section 3 of our draft, we were // under the impression that something similar could be argued about // it too, but not quite (yet). Looking at // [I-D.baber-ianabis-rfc7120bis], there seems to be no text or // placeholders on that topic yet. We expect such text to come in // the future, to ensure that the early allocation procedure is fully // specified also for registries that use the augmented policies.</t>
