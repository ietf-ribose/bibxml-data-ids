      <t>This document is a compilation of special IPv6 addresses defined in other RFCs. It can be used as a checklist of invalid routing prefixes for developing filtering policies for routes and IP packets. It does not discuss addresses that are assigned to operators and users through the Regional Internet Registries. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>
