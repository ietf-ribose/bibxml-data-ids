      <t>Internet Protocol security mechanisms, such as IP Security (IPsec) [IPSEC], provides various security services for IP traffic. However, the benefits offered by IPsec may come at the cost of increased overhead. This document identifies a methodology for integrating header compression (HC) over IPsec (HCoIPsec). HCoIPsec proposes to reduce the amount of packet overhead associated with the transmission of traffic over tunnel mode security associations.</t>
