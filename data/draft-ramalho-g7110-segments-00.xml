      <t>This document describes use cases for ITU-T Recommendation G.711.0 compression of ITU-T Recommendation G.711 payloads when deployed in transport system segments using the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP). ITU-T Rec. G.711.0 defines a lossless and stateless compression for G.711 packet payloads typically used in IP networks. Although the use of ITU-T Rec. G.711.0 can be negotiated end-to-end, being lossless and stateless it can also be applied as a compression mechanism "in-the-middle" of an end-to-end ITU-T G.711 negotiated session. These "in-the-middle" applications of ITU-T Rec. G.711.0 are called "G.711.0 Compression Segments" in this document. This document outlines considerations and best practices (a.k.a. use cases) for these "G.711.0 compression segments".</t>
