      <t>This document specifies an extension of OSPF for IPv6 to supportmobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). The extension, called OSPF-MDR, isdesigned as a new OSPF interface type for MANETs. OSPF-MDR is basedon the selection of a subset of MANET routers, consisting of MANETDesignated Routers (MDRs) and Backup MDRs. The MDRs form a connecteddominating set (CDS), and the MDRs and Backup MDRs together form abiconnected CDS for robustness. This CDS is exploited in two ways.First, to reduce flooding overhead, an optimized flooding procedureis used in which only (Backup) MDRs flood new LSAs back out thereceiving interface; reliable flooding is ensured by retransmittingLSAs along adjacencies. Second, adjacencies are formed only between(Backup) MDRs and a subset of their neighbors, allowing for muchbetter scaling in dense networks. The CDS is constructed using 2-hopneighbor information provided in a Hello protocol extension. TheHello protocol is further optimized by allowing differential Hellosthat report only changes in neighbor states. Options are specifiedfor originating router-LSAs that provide full or partial topologyinformation, allowing overhead to be reduced by advertising lesstopology information.</t>
