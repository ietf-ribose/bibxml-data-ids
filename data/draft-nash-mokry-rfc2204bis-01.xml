      <t>This memo describes a file transfer protocol to facilitate electronic data interchange between trading partners. The protocol, denoted the ODETTE File Transfer Protocol, supports both direct communication between installations and indirect communication via a third party clearing centre. It was developed by the Organisation for Data Exchange by Tele Transmission in Europe to facilitate communication within the European motor industry and is presented here to allow for wider use within the Internet community.</t>
