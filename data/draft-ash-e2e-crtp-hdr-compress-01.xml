    <abstract>
      <t>VoIP typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP, wherein the packet header is at least 40 bytes, while the voice payload is typically no more than 30 bytes. VoIP header compression can significantly reduce the VoIP overhead through various compression mechanisms. This is important on access links where bandwidth is scarce, and can be important on backbone facilities, especially where costs are high (e.g., some global cross-sections). In this draft we propose to re-use the methods in cRTP to determine the header compression context and to use the cRTP session context ID to route a compressed packet between the ingress and egress routers.</t>
