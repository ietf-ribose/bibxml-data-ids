      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in TCP/IP-based internets. In particular, it defines objects for management of Digital Dataphone Service (DDS) interfaces. Along with the Definition of Managed Objects for RS-232-like Hardware Devices using SMIv2 [TBD], this memo also provides basic management capabilities for DDS DSU/CSU-like interfaces. This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1 definitions. This document reflects the work being done by the trunk-mib working group (trunk-mib@cisco.com).</t>
