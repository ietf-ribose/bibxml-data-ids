    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a lawful basis extension for Virtualized Conversations (vCon) that provides standardized mechanisms for recording, verifying, and managing the lawful basis for processing data within conversation containers. The lawful basis extension addresses privacy compliance challenges through structured attachment metadata, including the specific lawful basis being asserted, temporal validity periods where applicable, and cryptographic proof mechanisms. The extension is designed as a Compatible vCon extension that introduces lawful basis management capabilities without altering existing vCon semantics. It defines a "lawful_basis" attachment type with structured records for each of the six lawful bases defined in regulations like GDPR, including consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task, and legitimate interests. Key features include automated lawful basis detection during conversation processing, auditable records with cryptographic proofs, granular purpose-based permissions for all lawful bases, documented justifications for other lawful bases, and integration with privacy regulations including GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA.</t>
