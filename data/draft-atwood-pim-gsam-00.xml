      <t>This document specifies a Group Security Association Management (GSAM) protocol, which manages the IPsec Group Security Associations that are used to protect some packets of Secure IGMP (SIGMP) and Secure MLD (SMLD). In GSAM, one router is elected as the group controller / key server to create group security associations for all the interesting secure groups and distribute them to authorized users and other routers.</t>
