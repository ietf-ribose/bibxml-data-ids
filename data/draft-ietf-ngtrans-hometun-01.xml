      <t>Many Internet access providers for residential customers provide only one dynamic IPv4 address to their clients. This document proposes in such cases to use an IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel with IPSec (this gives a static global routable address or prefix with security) and to implement the processing at the server end of unsolicited neighbor advertisements for overriding the IPv4 address at the client end when it changes.</t>
