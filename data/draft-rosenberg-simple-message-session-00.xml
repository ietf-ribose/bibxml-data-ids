      <t>The SIMPLE working group has been debating the issue of the IM session model for quite some time. The primary issue is what transport to use for the IMs once the session is established with SIP. Proposals have included the SIP MESSAGE request itself, IMSX, and a SIP spin-off, called IMTP. The usage of SIP MESSAGE, the very first proposal, had been rejected by the group because of several technical issues. This document revists that decision, based on the recent enhancements made to SIP itself. We believe that SIP MESSAGE now represents the ideal transport choice for the IM session model.</t>
