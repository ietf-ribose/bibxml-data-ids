      <t>This draft describes a solution to enable an emulated LAN Service or Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) by decoupling the bridging and tunneling of Ethernet traffic into Customer Located Equipment (CLE) or Customer Edge (CE) and Provider Edge (PE), respectively. This decoupling of functions allows an operator to provision point-to- point transport of Ethernet services for customer on PEs, while leveraging bridging functions at CLEs to forward traffic towards the appropriate point-to-point Ethernet service leading to the destination node. This decoupling of functions also allow providers to leverage existing network infrastructures to enable VPLS while easing migration to new network infrastructures. This approach scales as the number of customers and sites increases, and as customers' emulated LAN sites span over a large wide area network. It is also the intention to show that an interface like Ethernet can be offered to customers and emulated LAN services can be enabled, but it is not mandatory to introduce VLAN like technologies (or PE-based type of VPLS) in the provider's network. In addition, existing and heterogeneous access technologies can be supported in a common network infrastructure.</t>
