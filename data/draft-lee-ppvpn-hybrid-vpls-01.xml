      <t>This draft describes a solution to enable an emulated LAN Service orVirtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) by decoupling the bridging andtunneling of Ethernet traffic into Customer Located Equipment (CLE)or Customer Edge (CE) and Provider Edge (PE), respectively. Thisdecoupling of functions allows an operator to provision point-to-point transport of Ethernet services for customer on PEs, whileleveraging bridging functions at CLEs to forward traffic towards theappropriate point-to-point Ethernet service leading to thedestination node. This decoupling of functions also allow providersto leverage existing network infrastructures to enable VPLS whileeasing migration to new network infrastructures. This approach scalesas the number of customers and sites increases, and as customers'emulated LAN sites span over a large wide area network. It is alsothe intention to show that an interface like Ethernet can be offeredto customers and emulated LAN services can be enabled, but it is notmandatory to introduce VLAN like technologies (or PE-based type ofVPLS) in the provider's network. In addition, existing andheterogeneous access technologies can be supported in a commonnetwork infrastructure.</t>
