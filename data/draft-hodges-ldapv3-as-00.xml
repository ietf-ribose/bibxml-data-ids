    <abstract>
      <t>The specification for the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol version 3 (LDAPv3) nominally comprises eight separte RFCs which were issued in two distinct subsets at separate times (RFCs 2251..2256 first, then RFCs 2229 and 2830 following later), but this has never been formally stated. Additionally, RFCs 2251..2256 each are embellished with an 'IESG Note' warning implementors and deployers of potential interoperability prob- lems due to the lack of a specification of mandatory-to-implement authentication mechanism(s). This document corrects both situations by explicitly specifying the set of RFCs comprising LDAPv3 and rescinding the 'IESG Note' due to the specification of mandatory-to-implement authentication mechanisms in RFC 2829.</t>
