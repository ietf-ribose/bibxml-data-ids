      <t>This document proposes an extension format for the Ultra-Lightweight Encapsulation (ULE) protocol. The proposed method allows ULE to carry both optional (with an explicit extension length) and mandatory (with an implicit extension length) header information to assist in network/Receiver processing of a SNDU. These functions modify the behaviour of ULE, and introduce header processing operations that will simplify the addition of new headers. This Internet Draft is presented as a separate document to allow ipdvb working group discussion of the design trade-offs involved. If accepted, the techniques will be incorporated within a future revision of ULE.</t>
