      <t>This memo describes the security framework for the InstantMessaging and Presence Protocols. It identifies the entities thatuse IMPP protocol elements, the trust relationships between them,security threats that are against which defence is to be provided,and the consequent security responsibilities of the activeentities. Specific cryptographic and other security mechanisms areNOT defined here.NOTE: The security framework for IMPP is inherently bound up withthe IMPP protocol design, and this memo is expected to evolve asdecisions are made about the protocol design. In its current form,this memo makes some assumptions about the IMPP structure that mustbe reviewed as design proceeds.</t>
