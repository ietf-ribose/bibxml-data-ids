      <t>This memo describes the lifecycle of MUD as seen from the perspective of a network operator. It is informational and intended to help provide perspective around the operation of a network which connects MUD-supporting devices and uses MUD- supporting network infrastructure. All phases of network operation that involves or affects MUD will be described. Considerations specific to device manufacturers will be described elsewhere. Considerations relevant to network equipment manufacturers and networking software authors will be described where appropriate where MUD behavior is affected.</t>
