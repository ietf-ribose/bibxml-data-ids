      <t>This document contains several updates to RFC 2418 designed to give more responsibility and authority to IETF Working Group Chairs. In particular, Working Group Chairs are given the responsibility of ensuring the technical quality, completeness and suitability of work produced by their Working Groups, and the authority to refuse to advance any work that does not meet the acceptance criteria for its proposed publication level. The importance of meeting minutes is emphasized, and Working Group chairs are also given more responsibility and authority for the management of working group mailing list discussions.</t>
