      <t>This document explains how to use the TCP Security Filter mechanism to initiate a Transport Layer Security (TLS) session to secure HTTP connections over the Internet. This allows unsecured and secured HTTP traffic to share the same well known port (in this case, http: at 80 rather than https: at 443). As an additional point, a similar mechanism like the described here could be used to provide other different kind of layers to HTTP connections.</t>
