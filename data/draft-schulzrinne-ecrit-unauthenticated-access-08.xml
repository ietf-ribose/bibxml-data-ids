      <t>The IETF emergency services architecture assumes that the callingdevice has acquired rights to use the access network or that noauthentication is required for the access network, such as for publicwireless access points. Subsequent protocol interactions, such asobtaining location information, learning the address of the PublicSafety Answering Point (PSAP) and the emergency call itself arelargely decoupled from the underlying network access procedures.In some cases, the device does not have credentials for networkaccess, does not have a VoIP provider or application service provider(ASP), or the credentials have become invalid, e.g., because the userhas exhausted their prepaid balance or the account has expired.This document provides a problem statement, introduces terminologyand describes an extension for the base IETF emergency servicesarchitecture to address these scenarios.</t>
