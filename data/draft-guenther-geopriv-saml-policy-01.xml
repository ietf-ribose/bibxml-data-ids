      <t>Rules of an authorization policy prescribe under which conditions an entity or subject has which permissions. Existing policies support identity-based authorization by matching the authenticated identity of the entity requesting access to a resource with the available policies. This document is about formulating policy rules that express conditions with respect to SAML assertions, thereby supporting non-identity-based authorization and anonymity.</t>
