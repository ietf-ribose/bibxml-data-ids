      <t>As IP networks grow more complicated, these networks require a new interaction mechanism between customers and their networks based on intent rather than detailed specifics. An intent-based protocol language is need to enable customers to easily describe their diverse intent for network connectivity to the network management systems. This document describes the problem Intent-Based NEtwork Modeling (IB-Nemo) language is trying to solve, a summary of the use cases that demonstrate this problem, and a proposed scope of work. Part of the scope is the validation of the language as a minimal subset. The IB-NEMO language is a protocol language for interactions between an application and a network manager/controller. Some would call this boundary between the application and the network management system as northbound interface (NBI), and any protocol language that crosses this as an NBI. IB-Nemo focuses on creating minimal subset of the total possible Intent-Based desired commands. By creating a minimal subset (about 20% of the total possible), the IB-Nemo language can be a simple Intent interface for most applications (hopefully 80%). Part of validation of this language is to to determine what data models should result in the network controller from different use cases. This way as IB-Nemo protocol language is reduced the effort can verify that the critical information is stilled passed.</t>
