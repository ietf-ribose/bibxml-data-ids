      <t>In Internet telephony, the call control functions of a traditionalcircuit switch are replaced by a IP-based call controller that mustprovide features normally provided by the traditional switch,including operating as a SSP for IN features. A traditional switchis armed with an IN call model that provides it a means to reach outand make service decisions based on intelligence stored elsewhere.Internet call controllers, by contrast, do not have an IN call model.</t>
