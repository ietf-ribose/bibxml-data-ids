      <t>In Internet telephony, the call control functions of a traditional circuit switch are replaced by a IP-based call controller that must provide features normally provided by the traditional switch, including operating as a SSP for IN features. A traditional switch is armed with an IN call model that provides it a means to reach out and make service decisions based on intelligence stored elsewhere. Internet call controllers, by contrast, do not have an IN call model.</t>
