      <t>Current Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) server discovery mechanisms are relatively static and limited to explicit configuration. These are usually under the administrative control of the application or TURN service provider, and not the enterprise or the ISP, the network in which the client is located.

This document describes two such mechanisms for TURN server discovery.</t>
