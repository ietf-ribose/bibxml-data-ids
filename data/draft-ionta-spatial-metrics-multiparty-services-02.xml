      <t>One of the best chances for a Service Provider to face the complexgrowth of IP Services, and their challenging requirements/SLAs alongthe Core network, is to enrich the current Performance metrics - mainlyderived from a Network-oriented point of view, and therefore a generalperspective, not focused on specific services - with some morePerformance factors, so to include a Service-oriented point of view,more centred on the particular kind of service, with its owncharacteristics in terms of protocol, application, manageability,and so on.To achieve the above goal, and starting from the one-to-groupperformance metrics outlined in RFC 5644 [RFC5644], an effort to adeeper analysis and definition of spatial aggregation metrics (as apart of the framework for metric composition defined in RFC 5835[RFC5835])is proposed in this memo, where the main focus is onmultiparty communications (e.g. video providers, online biding,online stock market, etc.).This memo lends itself to passive measurement as well as activemeasurement.Finally this memo is tuned to RFC 6390 [RFC6390] in terms of scopes,framework concepts, and need to widen the current performance metricsdepending on the application, service etc.</t>
