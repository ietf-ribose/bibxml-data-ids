      <t>This document specifies version 4+ of the Internet Protocol (IPv4+). IPv4 is very successful,simple and elegant. continuation and expansion of the IPv4 is necessary. Existing systems, devices only need to upgrade the software to support IPv4+, without the need to update new hardwares,saving investment costs.
