    <abstract>
      <t>The current Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) all-active multi- homing procedures in Network Virtualization Over Layer-3 (NVO3) networks provide the required Split Horizon filtering, Designated Forwarder Election and Aliasing functions that the network needs in order to handle the traffic to and from the multi-homed CE in an efficient way. In particular, the Aliasing function supports load balancing of unicast traffic from remote Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) devices to NVEs that are multi-homed to the same CE, regardless of whether the CEâ€™s MAC/IP information has been learned on all those NVEs. This document introduces an optional enhancement to the EVPN multi-homing Aliasing function, referred to as EVPN Anycast Multi- homing. This optimization is specific to EVPN deployments over NVO3 tunnels (i.e., IP-based tunnels) and may offer benefits in typical data center designs, which are discussed herein.</t>
