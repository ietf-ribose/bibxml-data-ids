      <t>This memo describes a mechanism providing database exchange and reliable transmission capabilities in a way which is adapted to link state routing on ad hoc networks. This mechanism is specified in this document for wireless OSPF interfaces as specified in draft- spagnolo-manet-ospf-wireless-interface-00.txt. A signature exchange technique is proposed, providing a very compact way for the nodes to communicate and compare the state of their respective link-state databases. Upon receiving such a signature, a node can quickly detect if a discrepancy is present and, furthermore, determine which information must be exchanged in order to alleviate this discrepancy.</t>
