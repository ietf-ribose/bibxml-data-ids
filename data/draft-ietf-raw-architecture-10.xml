      <t>Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) provides for high reliability and availability for IP connectivity across any combination of wired and wireless network segments. The RAW Architecture extends the DetNet Architecture and other standard IETF concepts and mechanisms to adapt to the specific challenges of the wireless medium, in particular intermittently lossy connectivity. This document defines a network control loop that optimizes the use of constrained spectrum and energy while maintaining the expected connectivity properties, typically reliability and latency. The loop involves OAM, PCE, and PREOF extensions, and a new Controller plane Function called the Path Selection Engine, that dynamically selects the DetNet path for the next packets to route around local failures.</t>
