    <abstract>
      <t>RFC4762 describes a mechanism to remove or unlearn MAC addresses that have been dynamically learned in a Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) Instance for faster convergence on topology change. The procedure also removes MAC addresses in the VPLS that do not require relearning due to such topology change. This document defines an enhancement to the MAC Address Withdrawal procedure with empty MAC List from RFC4762, which enables a Provider Edge(PE) device to remove only the MAC addresses that need to be relearned. Additional extensions to RFC4762 MAC Withdrawal procedures are specified to provide optimized MAC flushing for the Provider Backbone Bridging (PBB)VPLS specified in RFC7041.</t>
