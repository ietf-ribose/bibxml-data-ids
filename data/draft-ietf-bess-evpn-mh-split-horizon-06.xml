    <abstract>
      <t>Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) is commonly used along with Network Virtualization Overlay (NVO) tunnels, as well as MPLS and Segment Routing tunnels. The EVPN multi-homing procedures may be different depending on the tunnel type used in the EVPN Broadcast Domain. In particular, there are two multi-homing Split Horizon procedures to avoid looped frames on the multi-homed CE: ESI Label based and Local Bias. ESI Label based Split Horizon is used for MPLSoX tunnels, E.g., MPLSoUDP, whereas Local Bias is used for other tunnels, E.g., VXLAN tunnels. The existing specifications do not allow the operator to decide which Split Horizon procedure to use for tunnel encapsulations that could support both. Examples of tunnels that may support both procedures are MPLSoGRE, MPLSoUDP, GENEVE or SRv6. This document updates the EVPN Multi-Homing procedures in RFC8365 so that an operator can decide the Split Horizon procedure for a given tunnel depending on their own requirements.</t>
