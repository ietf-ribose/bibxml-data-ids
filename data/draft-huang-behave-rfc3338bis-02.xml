      <t>This document describes the "Bump-In-the-API" (BIA) host basedprotocol translation mechanism that allows applications supportingonly one IP address family to communicate with peers that arereachable or supporting only the other address family.This specification addresses scenarios where a host is provided dualstack or IPv6 only network connectivity. In the dual stack networkcase, single address family applications in the host sometime willcommunicate directly with other hosts using the different addressfamily. In the case of IPv6 only network or IPv6 only destination,IPv4-originated communications have to be translated into IPv6.Technically, the BIA-enabled host resolves both A and AAAA addressesof the destination and behaves according to received responses.Acknowledgement of previous workThis document is an update to and directly derivative from SeungyunLee, Myung-Ki Shin, Yong-Jin Kim, Alain Durand, and Erik Nordmark's[RFC3338], which similarly provides a dual stack host means tocommunicate with other IPv6 host using existing IPv4 appliations.Theoriginal document was a product of the NGTRANS working group.The changes in this document reflect four components1. Supporting IPv6 only network connections2. IPv4 address pool use private address3. Extending ENR and address mapper to operate differently4. Adding an alternative way to implement the ENRThe goal of this mechanism is the same as that of the Bump-in-the-stack mechanism, but this mechanism provides the translation methodbetween the IPv4 APIs and IPv6 APIs. Thus, the goal is simplyachieved without IP header translation.</t>
