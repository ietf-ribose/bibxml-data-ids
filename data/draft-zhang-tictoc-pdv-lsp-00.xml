      <t>This document defines a mechanism for the setup,reoptimization and recovery of PTP LSP based on the PDV metrics between the 1588 Master and the 1588 Slave. When a PTP communication path goes through the third party networks (e.g. the MPLS networks), the PDV noise caused by the third party networks will have a significant impact on the synchronization performance. So, the PDV metrics should be considered in the setup of PTP LSP. In addition, when the PDV noise exceeds to a certain degree, it is necessary to notify the head-end LSR(i.e. the 1588 Master) to switch to the backup PTP LSP and to reoptimize the primary PTP LSP in order to improve the PTP reliability.</t>
