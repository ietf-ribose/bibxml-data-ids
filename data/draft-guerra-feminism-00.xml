      <t>This document aims to describe how internet standrds and protocols and its implementations may impact diverse groups and communities. The research on how some protocol can be enabler for specific human rights while possibly restricting others has been documented in [RFC8280]. Similar to how RFC 8280 has taken a human rights lens through which to view engineering and design choices by internet standardisation, this document addreses the opportunities and vulnerabilities embedded within internet protocols for specific, traditionally maginalised groups.</t>
