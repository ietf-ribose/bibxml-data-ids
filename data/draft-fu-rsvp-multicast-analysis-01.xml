      <t>RSVP version 1 has been designed for optimum support multicast.However, in reality multicast is being used much less frequently thananticipated. Still, even for unicast (one sender, one receiver)full-fledged multicast-enabled RSVP signaling must be used. Aspointed out in the NSIS requirement draft, multicast would not benecessarily required for an NSIS signaling protocol. This draftanalyses ingredients of RSVP Version 1 which are affected bymulticast, and derives how these ingredients may look like ifmulticast is not supported in the generic RSVP signaling protocol andadapt related functionalities accordingly - we call the resultingfeature set 'RSVP Lite', a potentially more light-weight version ofRSVP.</t>
