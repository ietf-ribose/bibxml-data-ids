      <t>This document describes implications of applying end-to-end encryption at the transport layer. It identifies in-network uses of transport layer header information. It then reviews the implications of developing encrypted end-to-end transport protocols on transport protocol design and the implications on network operation. Since transport measurement and analysis of the impact of network characteristics have been important to the design of current transport protocols, it also considers some anticipated implications on transport and application evolution.</t>
