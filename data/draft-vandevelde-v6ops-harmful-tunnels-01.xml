      <t>IPv6 is ongoing and natively being deployed by a growing communityand it is important that the quality perception and traffic flows areas optimal as possible. Ideally it would be as good as the IPv4perceptive experience.This paper looks into a set of transitional technologies where theactual user has IPv6 connectivity through the means of IPv6-in-IPv4tunnels. A subset of the available tunnels has the property of beingnon-managed (i.e. 6to4 [RFC3056] and Teredo [RFC4380] ).While native IPv6 deployments will keep growing it is uncertain oreven expected that non-managed IPv6 tunnels will be providing thesame user experience and operational quality as managed tunnels ornative IPv6 connectivity.This paper will detail some considerations around non-managed tunnelsand will document the harmful element of these for the future growthof networks and the Internet.</t>
