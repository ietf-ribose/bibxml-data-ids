      <t>SPAN-A (pronounced 'spanner') is a candidate for the pre-midcom SPANprotocol. The scope of SPAN (Simple Protocol for Augmenting NATs) isto enable protocols involving multiple associated sessions to operateacross NATs. Such protocols typically use transport addresses toidentify associated sessions. This works well for environments whereend-to-end addressing is in force, but is broken by the introductionof NATs. SPAN is intended to operate with symmetric NATs by using arelay outside the NAT. It complements STUN [STUN] which operateswith various kinds of cone NAT.</t>
