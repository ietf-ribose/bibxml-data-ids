      <t>*This version of the document is aimed to be a base reference point to compare against to see how YANG Push Lite compares to the two core RFCs [RFC8639] &amp; [RFC8641] that it is based on. The next draft revision would serve as a better starting point to see the proposed protocol &amp; data model for YANG Push Lite.* YANG Push Lite is a simplified specification of YANG Push, specifically optimized for observability of operational data. This early draft proposes some enhancements to YANG-Push to optimize its behavior for operational data telemetry. It also lists some additional issues that could potentially be discussed if there is further interest in this work, in particular whether we should be attempting extensions to YANG-Push (as this document is currently framed) or instead should attempt to define a new 'YANG-Push lite'.</t>
