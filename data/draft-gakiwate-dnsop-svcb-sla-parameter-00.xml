    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a new SvcParamKey for use in Service Binding (SVCB) and HTTPS DNS resource records which enables authoritative DNS servers to indicate that a service should be used by clients having specific service levels or use types, such as "interactive", "background" or "realtime". By providing this information, clients can make informed decisions about which service endpoints to use based on specific applications needs at that time of making connections.</t>
