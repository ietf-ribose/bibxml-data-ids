      <t>The Site Security Handbook(SSH) Working Group(WG) of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has been working since 1994 to produce a pair of documents designed to educate the Internet community in the area of security. The first document is a complete reworking of RFC 1244, and is targeted at system and network administrators, as well as decision makers (middle management). The second document is targeted at end users of computer and network systems, including individuals using a modem and computer at home.</t>
