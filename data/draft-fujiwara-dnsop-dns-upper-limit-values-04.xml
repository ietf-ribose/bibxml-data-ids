      <t>DNS was designed to have as few hard upper limits as possible to allow for future extensibility. However, the lack of a clear upper limit leads to vulnerabilities, and several attack methods have been reported. This document collects upper limit values implemented by DNS software to avoid vulnerabilities.</t>
