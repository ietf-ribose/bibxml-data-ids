      <t>The purpose of the Incident Report Format is to facilitate the exchange of incident information and statistics among involved parties and responsible Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) for reactionary analysis of current intruder activity and proactive identification of trends that can lead to incident prevention. A common and well defined format will help in retrieving, archiving and exchanging Incident Reports across organizations, regions and countries. This document describes the requirements for an Incident Report format.</t>
