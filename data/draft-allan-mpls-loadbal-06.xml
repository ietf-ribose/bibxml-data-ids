      <t>RFC 3031 permits MPLS load balancing while making no specific representations as to implementation requirements. This has subsequently become an issue with respect to the reliability of path test mechanisms. Load balancing algorithms may separate path test probes from the path of interest. This document proposes guidelines for implementation of load balancing such that path test mechanisms are not impacted.</t>
