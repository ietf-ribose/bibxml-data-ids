      <t>This document defines a new report block type within the framework of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports (XR). One of the initial XR report block types is the Loss Run Length Encoding (RLE) Report Block. This report conveys the information regarding the individual Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packet receipt and loss events experienced during the RTCP interval preceding the transmission of the report. The new report, which is referred to as the Post-repair Loss RLE Report, carries the information regarding the remaining lost packets after all error-repair techniques are applied.

This document also defines the signaling of the Post-repair Loss RLE Report in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).</t>
