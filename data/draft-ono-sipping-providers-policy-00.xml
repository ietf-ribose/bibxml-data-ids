      <t>Some service providers who operate SIP proxy servers and registrars need to be able to express various types of policies to their customers, such as media policies and security policies. Discussion needs to take place about the types of policies and how they will have an impact on SIP User Agents (UA)s. This document presents an overview of the types of policies that might be available, and how the operations of policies might be executed to aid in advancing the current discussions on session policies.</t>
