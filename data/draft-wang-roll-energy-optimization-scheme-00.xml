      <t>Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) are composed of devices that have constraints on processing power, memory, and energy (battery power). It is obvious that conserving energy is especially important in the LLNs. This document is aimed at proposing an efficient and effective scheme to optimize the energy in the process of seeking the DAG root node.</t>
