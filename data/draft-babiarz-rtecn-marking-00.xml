      <t>At the 62nd IETF meeting, it was requested that the authors of Congestion Notification Process for Real-Time Traffic (RT-ECN) draft look at rate proportional marking as an method of indicating that traffic has exceeded a configured rate. In version 03 of RT-ECN draft (draft-babiarz-tsvwg-rtecn-03) we stated, when the rate exceeds the engineered traffic level, all packets as indicated by a DS codepoint from ECN-capable end-systems are marked to indicate congestion for the duration of the experienced congestion. In this memo, we looked at the two approaches, provide analysis as well our conclusions.</t>
