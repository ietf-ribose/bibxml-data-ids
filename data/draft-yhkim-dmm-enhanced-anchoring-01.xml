      <t>This document presents a new perspective for the solution design of enhanced mobility anchoring in a distributed mobility management deployment. Based on the definition of anchor function, location management function, and forwarding management function in RFC7429, we propose four cases of distributed deployment models and enhanced anchoring models over them.</t>
