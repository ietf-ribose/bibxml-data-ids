      <t>This document specifies automated bootstrapping of a remote secure key infrastructure (BRSKI) using vendor installed IEEE 802.1AR manufacturing installed certificates, in combination with a vendor based service on the Internet. Before being authenticated, a new device has only link-local connectivity, and does not require a routable address. When a vendor provides an Internet based service devices can be redirected to a local service. In limited/ disconnected networks or legacy environments we describe a variety of options that allow bootstrapping to proceed. Support for lower security models, including devices with minimal identity, is described for legacy reasons but not encouraged.</t>
