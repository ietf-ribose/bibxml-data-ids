      <t>The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 and co-existence of IPv4 and IPv6 is a subject of much debate. However, the big picture of the transition doesn't seem to have been discussed sufficiently.

This memo tries to point out some issues that will need consideration in the transition architecture.</t>
