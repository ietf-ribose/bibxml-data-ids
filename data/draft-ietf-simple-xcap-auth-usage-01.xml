      <t>This document describes three usages of the Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) that allow a client to provide authorization decisions regarding watchers of their presence. The first of these usages, called permission-statements, contains statements about what permissions are to be granted to watchers of presence. The second of these usages, called compound-permissions, allows a client to define new permissions as combinations of other defined permissions. The third usage, called supported-permissions, allows a client to determine what permissions are understood by the provider.</t>
