      <t>This memo defines Name-based sockets. name-based sockets allowapplication developers to refer to remote hosts (and it self) by nameonly, passing on all IP (locator) management to the operating system.Applications are thus relieved of re-implementing features such asmulti-homing, mobility, NAT traversal, IPv6/IPv4 interoperability andaddress management in general. The operating system can in turn re-use the same solutions for a whole set of guest applications. name-based sockets aims to provide a whole set of features without addingnew indirection layers, new delays or other dependences whilemaintaining transparent backwards compatibility.</t>
