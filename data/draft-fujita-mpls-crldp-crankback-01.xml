      <t>This draft proposes crankback routing extensions for CR-LDP signaling. Recently, several routing protocol extensions for advertising resource information in addition to topology information have been proposed for use in distributed constraint-based routing. In such a distributed routing environment, however, the information used to compute a constraint-based path may be out of date. This means that label requests may be blocked by links or nodes without sufficient resources. This draft specifies crankback routing extensions for CR-LDP so that the label request can be retried on an alternate path that detours around the blocked link or node upon a setup failure. Furthermore, the proposed crankback routing schemes can be also applied to end-to-end LSP restoration by indicating the location of the failure link or node. This would significantly improve the recovery ratio for failed LSPs, especially in situations where a large number of setup requests are triggered at the same time.</t>
