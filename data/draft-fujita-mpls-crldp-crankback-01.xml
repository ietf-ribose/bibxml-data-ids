      <t>This draft proposes crankback routing extensions for CR-LDPsignaling. Recently, several routing protocol extensions foradvertising resource information in addition to topology informationhave been proposed for use in distributed constraint-based routing.In such a distributed routing environment, however, the informationused to compute a constraint-based path may be out of date. Thismeans that label requests may be blocked by links or nodes withoutsufficient resources. This draft specifies crankback routingextensions for CR-LDP so that the label request can be retried on analternate path that detours around the blocked link or node upon asetup failure. Furthermore, the proposed crankback routing schemescan be also applied to end-to-end LSP restoration by indicating thelocation of the failure link or node. This would significantlyimprove the recovery ratio for failed LSPs, especially in situationswhere a large number of setup requests are triggered at the sametime.</t>
