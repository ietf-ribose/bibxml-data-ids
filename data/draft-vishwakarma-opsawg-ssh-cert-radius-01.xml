      <t>A scalable and centralized mechanism is required for a certificate- based administrative access to multitude of virtualized and physical network functions. While there are mechanisms that exist today to provide secure administrative command-line and API-based access, there are certain management and maintenance overheads as well as certain scalability challenges related to it. In this draft we discuss these challenges and propose a standardized, centralized server-based mechanism to authenticate a user over an SSH session using its client certificate.</t>
