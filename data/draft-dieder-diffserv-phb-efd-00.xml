    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a new per-hop behavior (PHB) for Differentiated Services, the so-called 'Expedited Forwarding with Dropping' PHB. Packets marked for this PHB are forwarded with the same low-delay, low-jitter characteristics as packets marked with the Expedited Forwarding PHB, but may experience a certain probability of packet loss. This PHB is especially suited to provide low-delay services in cellular wireless networks</t>
