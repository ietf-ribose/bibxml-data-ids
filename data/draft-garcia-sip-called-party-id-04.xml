      <t>This memo describes a private extension to SIP in the form of aP-Called-Party-ID header. A proxy inserts this header typically in anINVITE, en-route to its destination. The header is populated with theRequest-URI received by the proxy in the request. The UAS identifieswhich ID out of several IDs the invitation was sent to (for example,the user may be using simultaneously a personal and a business SIP URIto receive invitation to sessions). The UAS may use the information torender different distinctive audiovisual alerting tones, depending onthe ID used to receive the invitation to the session.</t>
