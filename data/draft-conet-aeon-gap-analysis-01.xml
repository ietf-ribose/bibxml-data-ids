      <t>Identification and treatment of application flows have become more and more important for network operators. In order to efficiently distinguish ICPs' traffic, coordination between ISPs and ICPs is required. IP flow identification can be based on ICPs' traffic carrying some mutually agreed identifiers. This document analyzes the technical gap between the current network functions and required network capability to enable such functionality.</t>
