    <abstract>
      <t>This document outlines a set of services enabled by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), that allow for access to voice services by people who are hearing impaired. SIP has gained much attention as a tool for voice communications on the Internet. Therefore, considerations for universal access of its services are important. This document does not propose any extensions or new capabilities to SIP, but rather a set of services enabled by it.</t>
