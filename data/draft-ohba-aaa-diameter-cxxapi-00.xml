      <t>The Diameter authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) protocol provides support for peering AAA transactions across the Internet. This document describes a standardized API for the Diameter protocol. The API is defined for the C++ language. The intent of the API is to foster source code portability across multiple programming platforms, leveraging the object-oriented nature of C++ and reusing what is already defined in the Diameter C API as much as possible. The C++ API can also be used as a basis to define more platform-independent API such as Java-based API.</t>
