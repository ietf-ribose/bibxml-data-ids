    <abstract>
      <t>Recent Internet applications, such as the World Wide Web, tie together a great diversity in data formats, client and server platforms, and communities. This has created a need for various kinds of negotiation mechanisms, which tailor the data which is exchanged, or the exchange process itself, to the capabilities and preferences of the parties involved. Extensible negotiation mechanisms need a vocabulary to identify various things which can be negotiated on. To promote interoperability, a registration process is needed to ensure that that this vocabulary, which can be shared between negotiation mechanisms, is developed in an orderly, well-specified, and public manner. This document discusses requirements and scenarios the registration of this vocabulary, which is the vocabulary of feature tags. Feature tag registration is foreseen as an ongoing, open process which will keep pace with the introduction of new features by software vendors, and other parties such as standards bodies.</t>
