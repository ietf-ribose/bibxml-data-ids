      <t>In COPS-PR, the (clients of the) PEPs use special structures, called Policy Information Bases (PIBs) that store the policies that are sent by the PDPs. PIBs are well-defined structures that are not meant to be modified to adapt to the needs of each network. This makes COPS-PR PEPs rigid and inflexible. This document describes an extension of the COPS-PR protocol that allows the PEPs to store meta-policies that control the content of their PIBs. The set of meta-policies that the PEPs can store is not predefined and customized policies can be supported. The use of meta-policies pushes intelligence towards the PEPs and makes them more self- dependent. In this way, the model becomes more distributed, scalable and fault-tolerant, while the bandwidth consumption and the (real- time) processing load of the PDP are reduced.</t>
