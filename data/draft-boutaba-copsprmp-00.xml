      <t>In COPS-PR, the (clients of the) PEPs use special structures, calledPolicy Information Bases (PIBs) that store the policies that aresent by the PDPs. PIBs are well-defined structures that are notmeant to be modified to adapt to the needs of each network. Thismakes COPS-PR PEPs rigid and inflexible. This document describes anextension of the COPS-PR protocol that allows the PEPs to storemeta-policies that control the content of their PIBs. The set ofmeta-policies that the PEPs can store is not predefined andcustomized policies can be supported. The use of meta-policiespushes intelligence towards the PEPs and makes them more self-dependent. In this way, the model becomes more distributed, scalableand fault-tolerant, while the bandwidth consumption and the (real-time) processing load of the PDP are reduced.</t>
