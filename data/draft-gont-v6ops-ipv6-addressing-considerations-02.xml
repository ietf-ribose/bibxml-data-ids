      <t>IPv6 addresses can differ in a number of properties, such as scope, stability, and intended usage type. This document analyzes the impact of these properties on aspects such as security, privacy, interoperability, and network operations, with the goal of providing guidance about IPv6 address usage. Additionally, it identifies challenges and gaps that currently prevent systems and applications from leveraging the increased flexibility and availability of IPv6 addresses.</t>
