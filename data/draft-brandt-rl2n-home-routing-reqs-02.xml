      <t>This document presents the home control and automation applicationspecific requirements for Routing in Low power and Lossy Networks(RL2N). In a modern home, a high number of wireless devices are usedfor a wide set of purposes. Examples include lighting controlmodules, heating control panels, light sensors, temperature sensors,gas/water leak detector, motion detectors, video surveillance,healthcare systems and advanced remote controls. Because suchdevices only cover a limited radio range, multi-hop routing is oftenrequired. Such devices are usually highly constrained in terms ofresources such as battery and memory and operate in unstableenvironments. The aim of this document is to specify the routingrequirements for networks comprising such constrained devices in ahome network environment.</t>
