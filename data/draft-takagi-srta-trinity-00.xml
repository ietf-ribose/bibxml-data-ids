      <t>This document proposes a conceptual architecture for ensuring the safety of autonomously coordinating AI systems, particularly future Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Starting from the reliability challenges facing current multi-agent AI, we outline the Structured Responsibility and Traceability Architecture (SRTA) as a practical framework for their resolution. We then extend the philosophy of SRTA to present the "Trinity Configuration," an advanced role-based model for AI agents that draws an analogy from the theological doctrine of the Trinity. This paper comparatively examines the evolutionary stages of this configuration and introduces a novel concept, the "Filioque Command," to define dynamic information flows between agents. While this series of considerations includes concepts that are not fully verifiable at present, its purpose is to provide a crucial theoretical foundation for the governance structure of a safe superintelligence -- a "North Star" for AI research to aim for.</t>
