    <abstract>
      <t>Online users have demonstrated a desire to know instantly whether another individual is online, to be notified when another individual arrives online, and to send instant messages. These applications currently use independent, non-standard and usually non-interoperable protocols. The goal is to define a standard protocol so that independently written client and server implementations can participate in a global network of ''online'' users. This draft outlines requirements for a Presence Information Protocol to support these applications. Distribution of this document is unlimited.
