      <t>When security vulnerabilities are discovered by independent security researchers, they often lack the channels to report them properly. As a result, security vulnerabilities may be left unreported. This document defines a format ("security.txt") to help organizations describe the process for security researchers to follow in order to report security vulnerabilities.</t>
