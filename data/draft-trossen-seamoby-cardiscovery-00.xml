      <t>A critical requirement in the protocols being designed for seamless IP-level handovers, such as fast handover and context transfer, is that the target access router (TAR) for the mobile node's (MN) handover is known to the current access router (AR). The TAR needs to have the capability set necessary to meet the MN's requirements, and meet any local policy requirements. While the TAR selection process happens at the time of handover, the ARs which have the capabilities to meet the MN's requirements can be identified in advance. These ARs are called candidate access routers (CARs).</t>
