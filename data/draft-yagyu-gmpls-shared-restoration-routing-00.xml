      <t>Shared mesh restoration technique efficiently uses network resourcessince restoration capacity is shared across multiple independentfailures. In this scheme, when a new working LSP is established, itscorresponding backup LSP is pre-calculated and resources along therestoration route are reserved. The resources reserved on each linkalong the restoration path may be shared across different workingLSPs that are not expected to fail simultaneously. To make the methodfor selection of backup LSPs more efficient in terms of utilizationof network resources, each link should provide the route calculatorwith information about its restoration capacity and SRLGs of workingLSPs whose backup LSPs share the link restoration capacity. In thisdocument we propose extensions to OSPF-TE in support of carrying link'Sharable Bandwidth' information.</t>
