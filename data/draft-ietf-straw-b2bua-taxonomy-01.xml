      <t>In many SIP deployments, SIP entities exist in the SIP signaling path between the originating UAC and final terminating UAS, which go beyond the definition of a Proxy, performing functions not defined in standards-track RFCs. The only term for such devices provided in [RFC3261] is for a Back-to-Back User Agent (B2BUA), which is defined as the logical concatenation of a User Agent Server (UAS) and User Agent Client (UAC). There are numerous types of SIP Back-to-Back User Agents (B2BUAs), performing different roles in different ways. For Example IP-PBXs, SBCs and Application Servers. This document identifies several common B2BUA roles, in order to provide taxonomy other documents can use and reference.</t>
