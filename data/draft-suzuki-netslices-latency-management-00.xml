      <t>This draft provides a use case that addresses the need for latency management for end-to-end data transmissions through multiple domains. Specifically, examples of latency management schemes are described. In addition, the necessity of a common latency management framework and of interfaces to gather latency information between edges in each domain and to determine data transmission paths is addressed.</t>
