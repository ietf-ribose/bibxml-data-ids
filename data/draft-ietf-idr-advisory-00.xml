      <t>The BGP routing protocol is used with external as well as internalneighbors to propagate route advertisements. In the case of externalBGP sessions, there is typically a demarcation of administrativeresponsibility between the two entities. Provisioning, maintenanceand administrative actions are communicated via off-line methods suchas email or telephone calls. While these methods have been used formany years, it can be troublesome for an operator to correlate a BGP-related event in the network with a notice that was transmitted inemail.This document proposes a new BGP message type, the Advisory message,which can be used to convey advisory information to a BGP speaker'speer. A capability is used to ensure that the recipient of theAdvisory message is capable of supporting it.</t>
