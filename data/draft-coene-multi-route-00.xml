      <t>This document describes a way to loadshare the different paths of amultihomed SCTP association at the same moment while keepingcongestion control per path. The document also describes a possiblesolution to multihoming which would require no routing tables on thehost and which would try to guarantee non-overlapping multihomedpaths. It could possibly reduce the growth of the routing table in arouter. The selection of which link to take would be a localone. The solution is similar to the use of links and linksets withina routeset in SS7.</t>
