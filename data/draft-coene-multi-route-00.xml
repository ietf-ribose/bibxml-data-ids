      <t>This document describes a way to loadshare the different paths of a multihomed SCTP association at the same moment while keeping congestion control per path. The document also describes a possible solution to multihoming which would require no routing tables on the host and which would try to guarantee non-overlapping multihomed paths. It could possibly reduce the growth of the routing table in a router. The selection of which link to take would be a local one. The solution is similar to the use of links and linksets within a routeset in SS7.</t>
