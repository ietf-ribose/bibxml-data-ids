      <t>Mobile IP protocol ensures correct routing of packets to mobilenode as the mobile node changes its point of attachment with theInternet. However, it is also required to provide proper QoSforwarding treatment to mobile node's packet stream at theintermediate nodes in the network, so that QoS-sensitive IPservices can be supported over Mobile IP. This document describesrequirements of an IP QoS mechanism for its satisfactory operationwith Mobile IP.</t>
