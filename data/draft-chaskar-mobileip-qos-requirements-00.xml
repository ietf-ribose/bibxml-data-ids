      <t>Mobile IP protocol ensures correct routing of packets to mobile node as the mobile node changes its point of attachment with the Internet. However, it is also required to provide proper QoS forwarding treatment to mobile node's packet stream at the intermediate nodes in the network, so that QoS-sensitive IP services can be supported over Mobile IP. This document describes requirements of an IP QoS mechanism for its satisfactory operation with Mobile IP.</t>
