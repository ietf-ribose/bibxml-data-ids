    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a YANG data model corresponding to the information model for Network Security Functions (NSF)-Facing Interface in Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF). It describes a data model for the features provided by generic security functions. This data model provides vendors with generic components that they understand well, so these generic components can be used even if they have some vendor specific functions. These generic functions represent a point of interoperability, and can be provided by any product that offers the required capabilities. Also, if they need additional features for their network security functions, the vendors can easily add the features by extending the YANG data model in this document.</t>
