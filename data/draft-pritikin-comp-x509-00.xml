      <t>This note defines the Compressed X.509 Format (CXF), a compact format for X.509 certificates and CRLs, and a way to translate between the compact format and standard X.509 encoding. The translation consists of the lossless compression algorithm DEFLATE with a particular predefined dictionary. Protocol bindings for TLS and IKE are designated. This format is useful in a constrained environment, where bandwidth and/or storage is low, and it preserves interoperability with standards-compliant X.509 certificates and the systems for certificate processing, issuance, and management.</t>
