      <t>This note defines the Compressed X.509 Format (CXF), a compact formatfor X.509 certificates and CRLs, and a way to translate between thecompact format and standard X.509 encoding. The translation consistsof the lossless compression algorithm DEFLATE with a particularpredefined dictionary. Protocol bindings for TLS and IKE aredesignated.This format is useful in a constrained environment, where bandwidthand/or storage is low, and it preserves interoperability withstandards-compliant X.509 certificates and the systems forcertificate processing, issuance, and management.</t>
