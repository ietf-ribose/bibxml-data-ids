      <t>This memo discusses how routers do, can, and should decide how to use the routing information available to them to route packets. It is particularly concerned with the problems of border routers and other routers which have to choose from among routes learned from the multiple routing domains, often using different routing protocols. Although this memo is not an official product of the Router Requirements working group, it is being published as an Internet Draft because it is required reading for those who wish to actively participate in the Router Requirements sessions during the IETF meeting in Atlanta.</t>
