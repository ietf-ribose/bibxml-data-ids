      <t>The Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) is an XML document format for exchanging emergency alerts and public warnings. Different organizations issue alerts for specific geographic regions. The Location-to-Service Translation (LoST) protocol provides a way to discover servers that distribute these alerts for a geographical region. This document defines the Service Uniform Resource Names (URN)s for warnings in the same way as they have been defined with RFC 5031 for citizen-to-authority emergency services. Additionally, this document suggests to use LoST for the discovery of servers distributing alerts.</t>
