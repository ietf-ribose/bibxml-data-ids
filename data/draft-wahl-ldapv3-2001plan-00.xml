      <t>The IESG prefers to avoid having RFCs linger in Proposed Standard Status. In general, RFCs which have demonstratable interoperability and usefulness should become Draft Standards, and eventually may become full Standards, as described in RFC 2026 [1] section 6.2. When a Proposed Standard RFC is reissued to become Draft, corrections, clarifications and other changes can be integrated into the update. However, if changes to the protocol are 'very significant', then the document needs to be issued as Proposed Standard again. This document describes an approach to reissue the core RFCs which describe LDAPv3, all of which are currently at Proposed Standard status. It also summarizes the status of other existing and upcoming standards-track LDAP RFCs.</t>
