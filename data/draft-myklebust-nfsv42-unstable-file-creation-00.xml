      <t>This document describes an extension to the NFSv4 protocol to allowclients to create and write files with greater efficiency.The first proposal allows the server to defer creating the file onstable storage when replying to an OPEN call. The aim is to improveserver efficiency and scalability by reducing the number of requireddisk accesses when writing a file from scratch.The second proposal allows the server to share information about theimplementation of its change attribute with the client. The aim isto improve the client's ability to determine the order in whichparallel updates to the same file were processed.KeywordsThe key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</t>
