      <t>NAT devices are available from a number of vendors and are in use by several residential and enterprise users. Yet, there is much variation in how the NAT devices work. Application developers, network administrators and users of NAT devices seek some level of uniformity and predictability in how various of the NAT devices operate. The objective of this document is to specify the operational and behavioral requirements on the NAT devices while processing TCP packets. A NAT device that conforms to the requirements listed in the document will bring predictability in how NATs operate with regard to TCP packet processing. A NAT device is said to be IETF behave compliant when it complies with the requirements outlined in this document and other companion BEHAVE documents like [BEH-UDP], which outlines the requirements for processing UDP and some generic requirements.</t>
