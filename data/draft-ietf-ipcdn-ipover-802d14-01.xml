      <t>This memo defines an initial application of classical IP and ARP in an IEEE 802.14 Community Access Television (CATV) Residential Access Network environment. IEEE 802.14 services provide two independent link layer service interfaces which are available to support IP residential access networking services: traditional Ethernet bridging (via IEEE 802.1D layer services) and residential ATM networking services. In this memo, the term Logical IP Subnetwork (LIS) is defined to apply to Classical IP over ATM LIS's operating over IEEE 802.14 services as well as traditional IP over Ethernet operating over IEEE 802.14 services. The recommendations in this draft rely on existing IETF standards for the family of Classical IP and ARP over ATM (IPOA) services and for IP and ARP over Broadcast Ethernet networks. The tree-based hierarchic nature of the IEEE 802.14 MAC subnetwork permits convenient extensions to Classical IPOA model for broadcast and multicast in the downstream direction of the CATV plant.</t>
