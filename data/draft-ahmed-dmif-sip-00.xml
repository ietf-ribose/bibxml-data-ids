      <t>This draft proposal discusses technical issues related to deliveryand control of IP multimedia services, such as video-conferencing,involving heterogeneous end terminals. In particular, it describesthe design and implementation of an experimental system forinterworking between IETF SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) and ISOMPEG-4 DMIF (Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework) session andcall control signaling protocols. This IP videoconferencinginterworking system is composed of two core units for supportingdelivery of audio-video streams from a DMIF domain to a SIP domain(i.e. DMIF2SIP unit) and from a SIP domain to a DMIF domain (i.e.SIP2DMIF unit). These units perform various translation functionsfor transparent establishment and control of multimedia sessionsacross IP networking environment, including, session protocolconversion, service gateway conversion and address translation.</t>
