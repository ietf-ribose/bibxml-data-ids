      <t>The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) model and protocols describe a set of conventions for the automation of operations traditionally seen as barriers to the use and deployment of secure, privacy-preserving end- to-end messaging. These include, but are not limited to, key management, key discovery, and private key handling (including peer- to-peer synchronization of private keys and other user data across devices). This document specifies the pEp KeyReset protocol that allows applications to provide simple high-level functionality to users needing to perform some of the aforementioned functions while still ensuring that the appropriate low-level changes in keyrings and trust management are handled consistently, and that communication of these changes to active partners (where necessary) happens seamlessly, without explicit action on the part of the user.</t>
