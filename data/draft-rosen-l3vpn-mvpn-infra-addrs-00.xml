      <t>To provide Multicast VPN service, a provider edge router originates"MCAST-VPN" BGP routes. These routes encode addresses from thecustomer's address space as well as addresses from the provider'saddress space. The customer's address space may be either IPv4 orIPv6. Independently, the provider's address space may be either IPv4or IPv6. The MCAST-VPN BGP routes always contain an "address family"field that specifies whether the customer addresses are IPv4addresses or whether they are IPv6 addresses. However, there is nofield that explicitly specifies whether the provider addresses areIPv4 addresses or whether they are IPv6 addresses. The existingspecifications do not explicitly say how to determine whether a givenprovider address is IPv4 or IPv6, and there are differing precedentsabout the method used to encode IPv4 addresses in messages that alsocontain IPv6 addresses. This document removes any ambiguity byspecifying that MCAST-VPN routes always encode provider IPv4addresses as four-octet addresses, and that the distinction betweenan IPv4 address and an IPv6 address is signaled solely by the lengthof the address field.</t>
