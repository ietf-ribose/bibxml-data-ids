      <t>This document describes the methodology for benchmarking SessionInitiation Protocol (SIP) performance as described in SIPbenchmarking terminology document. The methodology and terminologyare to be used for benchmarking signaling plane performance withvarying signaling and media load. Both scale and establishment rateare measured by signaling plane performance. The SIP Devices to bebenchmarked may be a single device under test (DUT) or a system undertest (SUT). Benchmarks can be obtained and compared for differenttypes of devices such as SIP Proxy Server, SBC, and server pairedwith a media relay or Firewall/NAT device.</t>
