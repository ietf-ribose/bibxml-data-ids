      <t>This specification defines a simple mechanism for streaming media data from a server to a client in a constrained network over CoAP. The mechanism take advantage of the observer design pattern described in CoAP, extending it, to support streaming media transfer between nodes. Note Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to core@ietf.org.</t>
