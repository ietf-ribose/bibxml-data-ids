      <t>This document describes the Relative Distance Micro-discovery AdHoc Routing (RDMAR) protocol for use in mobile ad hoc networks(MANETs). The protocol is highly adaptive, bandwidth-efficientand scaleable. A key concept in its design is that protocolreaction to link failures is typically localised to a very smallregion of the network near the change. This desirable behaviour isachieved through the use of a novel mechanism for route discovery,called Relative Distance Micro-discovery (RDM). The concept behindRDM is that a query flood can be localised by knowing the relativedistance (RD) between two terminals. To accomplish this, everytime a route search between the two terminals is triggered, aniterative algorithm calculates an estimate of their RD, given anaverage nodal mobility and information about the elapsed time sincethey last communicated and their previous RD. Based on the newlycalculated RD, the query flood is then localised to a limitedregion of the network centred at the source node of the routediscovery and with maximum propagation radius that equals to theestimated relative distance. This ability to localise query floodinginto a limited area of the network serves to increase scalabilityand minimise routing overhead and overall network congestion.</t>
