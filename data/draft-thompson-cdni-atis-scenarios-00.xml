      <t>The ATIS IPTV Interoperability Forum (IIF) is a leading developer ofrequirements, standards, and specifications for Internet ProtocolTelevision, or IPTV. IIF has specified an architecture for ContentOn Demand applications which was published as the [ATIS-0800042] IPTVContent on Demand (CoD) Service specification. ATIS IIF is nowworking on revision 2 of this document. Revision 2 of ATIS CoDspecification includes an additional work item called "InternetSourced Content" which includes "off net delivery". Both InternetSourced Content and off net delivery will address scenarios thatinclude delivery of content from a Content Service Provider throughmultiple CDNs operated by different organizations to a user agent.This document provides information on [ATIS-0800042], and theInternet Sourced Content and off net Delivery use cases that arerelevant to CDNI.The ATIS IIF architecture group focuses on developing architecturesand prefers to reference existing protocols where ever possible. If,and as, the IETF CDNI effort progresses, the ATIS IIF architecturegroup will be evaluating the protocols defined by the CDNI workinggroup for inclusion in the CDN interconnect scenarios defined as partof the Internet Sourced Content and off net Delivery use cases.A goal of the present document is to illustrate the Internet SourcedContent and off net Delivery use cases defined in revision 2 of theATIS CoD architecture that are relevant to the IETF CDNI work. It ishoped that these use cases can also be used to guide requirements forthe development of IETF CDNI protocols.</t>
