      <t>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) is an enhancement to VPN technology to enable it to support the needs of new applications, particularly applications that are associated with 5G services. These applications require better isolation from both control and data plane's perspective and have more stringent performance requirements than can be provided with overlay VPNs. The characteristics of an enhanced VPN as perceived by its tenant needs to be comparable to those of a dedicated private network. This requires tight integration between the overlay VPN and the underlay network resources in a scalable manner. An enhanced VPN may form the underpinning of 5G network slicing, but will also be of use in its own right. This document describes the use of segment routing based mechanisms to provide the enhanced VPN service with dedicated network resources. The proposed mechanism is applicable to both SR with MPLS data plane and SR with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</t>
