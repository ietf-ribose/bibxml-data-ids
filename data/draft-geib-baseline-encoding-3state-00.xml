      <t>Layer 2 transport services like MPLS offer only 2 states to encodeECN state, if DiffServ based Class of Service is operated. Still, amechanism by which PCN egress nodes can differentiate between thenormal behaviour state, admission stop state control state and flowtermination state, by using PCN marking of packets is desirable.This document describes how threshold and excess marking can becombined with PCN baseline encoding. A minimalistic approach likethe one described in the following has some obvious shortcomings.These shortcomings are also presented and discussed. Currently, theaim of this document is to trigger experimentation feasabilitystudies. Standardisation will be pursued in the future based on theresults of the studies.</t>
