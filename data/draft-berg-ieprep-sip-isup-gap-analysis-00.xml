      <t>This document begins a gap analysis of SIP-ISUP mapping from the perspective of ieprep. Draft-ietf-sipping-isup-02 does not addressmapping/translation for two ISUP IAM parameters of specific interest to ieprep: the mandatory Calling Party's Category and the optionalPrecedence parameters. On the assumption that both of these parametersshould be mapped/translated in SIP-ISUP interworking, this ID beginswith the proposal for a new SIP Resource-Priority header in work inprogress in ieprep. Several variations on the proposed new headerare formulated and assessed for use in mapping/translating the two IAM parameters. The ID concludes that either a single header with namespace differentiation of instances or two distinct headers would meet the needs of ieprep. It is recommended that this choice be made and reflected into draft-ietf-sipping-isup-02.</t>
