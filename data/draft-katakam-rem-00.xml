      <t>This RFC document envisages the need and necessity in utilizing or extending the compute resource technologies in such as networking(NW), remote computing(RC),cloud computing(CC),distributed computing(DC), Machine Learning(ML) and other related fields of AI to the biological field of electron microscopy(EC) for use in rapid and timely identification or diagnosis of virological/bacterial elements in clinical samples in the current world scenario, within the given time frame irrespective of the place of origin and with having geographical presence. Electron microscopy (EM) is a pioneering methodology used in identification and diagnosing of viral and microbiological elements. It is able to identify in morphological form the tiniest of the viruses in minimum amount of time by clinical scientists.</t>
