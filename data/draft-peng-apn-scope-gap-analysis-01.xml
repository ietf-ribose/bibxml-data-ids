    <abstract>
      <t>The APN work in IETF is focused on developing a framework and set of mechanisms to derive, convey and use an identifier to allow for the implementation of fine-grain user (group)-, application (group)-, and service-level requirements at the network layer. APN aims to apply various policies in different nodes along a network path onto a traffic flow altogether, that is, at the headend to steer into corresponding path, at the midpoint to collect corresponding performance measurement data, and at the service function to execute particular policies. Currently there is still no way to realise this composite network service provisioning along the path very efficiently. This document further clarifies the scope of the APN work and describesthe solution gap analysis.</t>
