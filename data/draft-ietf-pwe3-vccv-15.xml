      <t>This document describes Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV), which provides a control channel that is associated with a pseudowire (PW), as well as the corresponding operations and management functions (such as connectivity verification) to be used over that control channel. VCCV applies to all supported access circuit and transport types currently defined for PWs. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
