      <t>The Simple Roaming Authentication Protocol is intended to provide an authentication facility for other non-authenticated protocols. It utilises registered SASL [SASL] mechanisms. This protocol has been developed in order that an ISP's roaming customers can be authenticated when connecting via other networks or ISPs. Rather than deploying new client software to handle authenticating versions of all protocols (SMTP, POP3, NNTP etc) a single SRAP applet is deployed that handles the authentication for all other protocols. When the server of a non-authenticated protocol wishes to authenticate a client the server starts another connection back to the client using SRAP. The SRAP conversation authenticates the client to the server. The original non-authenticated protocol can now proceed. For example with SMTP consider two machines Alice's and Bob's. Alice's runs an SMTP client and a SRAP authenticatee; Bob's runs an SMTP server and a SRAP authenticator. Alice's machine connects to Bob's using SMTP. SMTP does not support authentication so another connection is made back from Bob's machine to Alice's, this time using SRAP. The SRAP conversation authenticates Alice to Bob. The SMTP conversation can now proceed.</t>
