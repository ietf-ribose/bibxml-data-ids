      <t>The standardization of RPSL (Routing Policy Specification Language) isimminent, and there is a user community eager to make use of the power-ful features it offers in the Routing Registry (IRR). Thus, a plan ofaction is needed to assure a successful transition from the RIPE-181language currently employed to describe routing policies in the IRR tothe more expressive RPSL. This document describes such a plan, whichthe authors believe can be used to bring about a successful transitionin a timely fashion with a minimum of disruption to the IRR and its cur-rent role in Internet routing. This document will be modified toreflect the progress of the transition if appropriate.</t>
