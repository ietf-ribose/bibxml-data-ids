      <t>The standardization of RPSL (Routing Policy Specification Language) is imminent, and there is a user community eager to make use of the power- ful features it offers in the Routing Registry (IRR). Thus, a plan of action is needed to assure a successful transition from the RIPE-181 language currently employed to describe routing policies in the IRR to the more expressive RPSL. This document describes such a plan, which the authors believe can be used to bring about a successful transition in a timely fashion with a minimum of disruption to the IRR and its cur- rent role in Internet routing. This document will be modified to reflect the progress of the transition if appropriate.</t>
