    <abstract>
      <t>RPKI ROAs and other digitally signed objects provide a practical solution to validate BGP routes for preventing route hijacks. During ROV operations, validation data may be sourced not only from issued ROAs but also from other local sources. These data sources can vary in terms of credibility, and ROV operations may therefore require different response actions for invalid or unknown routes. This document takes ROV as an example to describe a flexible RPKI-based route validation using multi-priority data, and outlines relevant use cases, framework, and requirements for ROV operations that involve multi-priority data.</t>
