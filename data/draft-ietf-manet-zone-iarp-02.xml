      <t>This document describes the Intrazone Routing Protocol (IARP), alimited scope proactive routing protocol used to improve theperformance of existing globally reactive routing protocols. Witheach node monitoring changes in its surrounding R-hop neighborhood(routing zone), global route discoveries to local destinations can beavoided. When a global route search is needed, the IARP's routingzones can be used to efficiently guide route queries outwards (viabordercasting) rather than blindly relaying queries from neighborto neighbor. The proactive maintenance of routing zones also helpsimprove the quality of discovered routes, by making them more robustto changes in network topology. Once routes have been discovered,IARP's routing zone offers enhanced, real-time, route maintenance.Link failures can be bypassed by multiple hop paths within therouting zone. Similarly, suboptimal route segments can be identifiedand traffic re-routed along shorter paths.</t>
