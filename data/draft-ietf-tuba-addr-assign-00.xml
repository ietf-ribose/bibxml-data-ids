      <t>There are currently two mechanisms defined for dynamic assignment of OSI NSAP addresses. This memo specifies a single mechanism for hosts to use that maximizes flexibility while allowing administrative control, and requires no configuration on the host. The method described in the memo is intended to be implemented universally in all end systems supporting CLNP, both for TUBA and pure OSI systems. This document will be submitted to ISO for consideration as a standard. Additionally, the method described could also be used in CATNIP networks.</t>
