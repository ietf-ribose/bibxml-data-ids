      <t>The Diameter Base specification, described in RFC 3588, provides anumber of ways to extend Diameter, with new Diameter commands, i.e.messages used by Diameter applications, and applications as the mostextensive enhancements. RFC 3588 illustrates the conditions thatlead to the need to define a new Diameter application or a newcommand code. Depending on the scope of the Diameter extension IETFactions are necessary. Although defining new Diameter applicationsdoes not require IETF consensus, defining new Diameter commandsrequires IETF consensus per RFC 3588. This has lead to questionabledesign decisions by other Standards Development Organizations whichchose to define new applications on existing commands rather thanasking for assignment of new command codes for the pure purpose ofavoiding bringing their specifications to the IETF. In some casesinteroperability problems were causes as an effect of the poor designcaused by overloading existing commands.This document aligns the extensibility rules of Diameter applicationwith the Diameter commands offering ways to delegate work on Diameterto other SDOs to extend Diameter in a way that does not lead to poordesign choices.</t>
