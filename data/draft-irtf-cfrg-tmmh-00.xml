      <t>TMMH is a 'universal' hash function suitable for message authentication in the Wegman-Carter paradigm. It is simple, quick, and especially appropriate for Digital Signal Processors and other processors with a fast multiply operation. This document specifies version two of TMMH, which eliminates the large storage requirement for hashing large messages that was present in version one.</t>
