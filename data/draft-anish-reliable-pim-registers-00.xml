      <t>This document introduces a hard-state, reliable transport for the existing PIM-SM registers states. This eliminates the needs for periodic NULL-registers and register-stop in response to each data- register or NULL-registers. This specification uses the existing PIM reliability mechanisms defined by PIM Over Reliable Transport [RFC6559]. This is simply a means to transmit reliable PIM messages and does not require the support for Join/Prune messages over PORT as defined in [RFC6559].</t>
