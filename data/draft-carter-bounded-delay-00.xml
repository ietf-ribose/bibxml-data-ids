    <abstract>
      <t>This document outlines a proposed new service class for the internet which is intended to provide for some small proportion of the total traffic on each link, a quantifiable, low-delay service having essentially no packet-loss. We call this proposed service, Bounded- delay (BD). The approach is consistent with the architecture and philosophy of diff-serv, and could potentially make use of the proposed EF PHB. BD is similar in many respects to Premium service which has been described previously [Twobit], except that BD is intended specifically to allow control of end-to-end delay in a quantifiable manner.</t>
