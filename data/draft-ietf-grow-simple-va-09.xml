      <t>The continued growth in the Default Free Routing Table (DFRT) stresses the global routing system in a number of ways. One of the most costly stresses is Forwarding Information Base (FIB) size: ISPs often must upgrade router hardware simply because the FIB has run out of space, and router vendors must design routers that have adequate FIB. FIB suppression is an approach to relieving stress on the FIB by NOT loading selected RIB entries into the FIB. Simple Virtual Aggregation (S-VA) is a simple form of Virtual Aggregation (VA) that allows any and all edge routers to shrink their RIB and FIB requirements substantially and therefore increase their useful lifetime. S-VA does not increase FIB requirements for core routers. S-VA is extremely easy to configure considerably more so than the various tricks done today to extend the life of edge routers. S-VA can be deployed autonomously by an ISP (cooperation between ISPs is not required), and can co-exist with legacy routers in the ISP.</t>
