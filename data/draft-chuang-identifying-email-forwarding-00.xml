      <t>Forwarded email often becomes unauthenticated because it breaks SPF (RFC7208) authentication and DKIM (RFC6376) authentication. For example mailing-lists distribute email to multiple recipients through a separate server than the original sending server that breaks IP based SPF authentication and potentially may modify the message that breaks the DKIM signature. This document calls for using ARC (RFC8617) to identify and authenticate forwarded emails by further specifying the naming of the two digital signatures present in ARC headers- the message signature and the seal. Because this uses ARC digital signature, the receiver has confidence that a valid signature corresponding to some forwarder only could have been generated by the named domain. This document also specifies that all forwarded mail flows have associated ARC headers and the means to characterize the mail flows.</t>
