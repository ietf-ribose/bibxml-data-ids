    <abstract>
      <t>To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion, an IPv6 prefix is reserved for use in private testing or as examples in other RFCs, documentation, and the like. Since site local addresses have special meaning in IPv6, these cannot be used in many example situations and are confusing. Instead, an IPv6 prefix is reserved in the range of the test address space.</t>
