      <t>This document defines a 6top Scheduling Function called "Scheduling Function Zero" (SF0). SF0 dynamically adapts the number of reserved cells between neighbor nodes, based on the currently allocated bandwidth and the neighbour nodes' requirements. Neighbor nodes negotiate in a distributed neighbor-to-neighbor basis the cell(s) to be added/deleted. SF0 uses the 6P signaling messages to add/delete cells in the schedule. Some basic rules for deciding when to add/ delete cells and for selecting the cells to be added/deleted within the schedule are also provided.</t>
