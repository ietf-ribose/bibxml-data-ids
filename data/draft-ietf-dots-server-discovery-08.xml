      <t>It may not be possible for a network to determine the cause for an attack, but instead just realize that some resources seem to be under attack. To fill that gap, Distributed-Denial-of-Service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) allows a network to inform a DOTS server that it is under a potential attack so that appropriate mitigation actions are undertaken. This document specifies mechanisms to configure DOTS clients with their DOTS servers. The discovery procedure also covers the DOTS Signal Channel Call Home.</t>
