      <t>There are requirements in diverse industries to establish multi-hop paths for characterized flows with bounded end-to-end latency and extremely low packet loss rate. Deterministic Networking (DetNet) can provide service satisfying the requirements. This document describes extensions to IGP-TE, including OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE to distribute information of DetNet, which can be used for DetNet path computation/selection. This document only covers the mechanisms by which DetNet information is distributed. The mechanisms for measuring, calculating or configuring DetNet capabilities, resources and other relevant parameters are out of the scope.</t>
