      <t>This document provides guidance to aid in the understanding of collaboration on standards development between Project 802 of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It is an almost complete rewrite of, and is intended to replace, RFC 4441. The updates reflect changes in the IETF and IEEE, and in the relationship between the two organizations, since RFC 4441 was written.</t>
