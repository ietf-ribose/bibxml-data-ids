    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes Network Management Automation (NMA) of cellular network services in 5G networks. For NMA, it proposes a framework empowered with Intent-Based Networking (IBN). The NMA in this document deals with a closed-loop network control, network intent translator, and network management audit. To support these three features in NMA, it specifies an architectural framework with system components and interfaces. Also, this framework can support the use cases of NMA in 5G networks such as the data aggregation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, network slicing, and the Quality of Service (QoS) in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X).</t>
