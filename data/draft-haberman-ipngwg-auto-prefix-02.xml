      <t>The expansion of the IP address space provided by IPv6 makes it both possible and reasonable to allocate entire subnets to environments that had been previously limited to a few individual IP addresses. Other protocols such as Neighbor Discovery and Stateless Address Autoconfiguration allow hosts within those subnets to be automatically configured. The router between this subnet and the upstream world requires just one more piece to make this process automatic, a network prefix. This document describes a mechanism for the automated delegation of an IPv6 network prefix. It allows routers to request either a specific prefix or any prefix. Upon authorizing the request the delegating router then returns a prefix and a lifetime for the use of the prefix. Optionally, the delegating and requesting routers can exchange routing protocol information.</t>
