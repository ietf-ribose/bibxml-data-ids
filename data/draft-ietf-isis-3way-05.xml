      <t>The IS-IS routing protocol (ISO 10589) requires reliable protocols atthe link layer for point-to-point links. As a result, it does not usea three-way handshake when establishing adjacencies on point-to-pointmedia. This paper defines an backward-compatible extension to theprotocol that provides for a three-way handshake. It is fullyinteroperable with systems that do not support the extension.Additionally, the extension allows the robust operation of more than256 point-to-point links on a single router.This extension has been implemented by multiple router vendors; thispaper is provided as information to the Internet community in orderto allow interoperable implementations to be built by other vendors.</t>
