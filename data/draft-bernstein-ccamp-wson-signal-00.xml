    <abstract>
      <t>While the current GMPLS WSON formalism can deal with many types of wavelength switching systems there is a desire to extend this control plane to include other common optical or hybrid electro optical systems such as OEO switches, regenerators, and wavelength converters. This document provides a WSON signal definition and characterization based on ITU-T interface and signal class standards and describes the signal compatibility constraints of this extended set of network elements. The signal characterization and network element compatibility constraints enable GMPLS routing and signaling to control these devices and PCE to compute optical light-paths subject to signal compatibility attributes.</t>
