    <abstract>
      <t>Mobile IP [1] requires several security associations: the Mobile Node must share a security association with its Home agent and its Correspondent Nodes to send the binding update; these messages must be authenticated to prevent potential denial of service attacks [2]. The MN and the Home Agent can have a static security association, established at the configuration time, but the case of the Correspondent Node is more complex since it cannot be assumed that the MN and the CN have any pre-established security association.</t>
