      <t>Mobile IP [1] requires several security associations: the Mobile Nodemust share a security association with its Home agent and itsCorrespondent Nodes to send the binding update; these messages mustbe authenticated to prevent potential denial of service attacks [2].The MN and the Home Agent can have a static security association,established at the configuration time, but the case of theCorrespondent Node is more complex since it cannot be assumed thatthe MN and the CN have any pre-established security association.</t>
