      <t>As an increasing number of cellular hosts are being connected to the Internet, IPv6 becomes necessary. Examples of such hosts are GPRS, UMTS, and CDMA2000 terminals. Standardization organizations are also making IPv6 mandatory in their newest specifications, such as the IP multimedia terminals specified for UMTS.
