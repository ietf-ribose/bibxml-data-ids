    <abstract>
      <t>Software that handles electronic mailing list messages (servers and user agents) needs a way to reliably identify messages that belong to a particular mailing list. With the advent of list header fields, it has become even more important to provide a unique identifier for a mailing list regardless of the particular host that runs the mailing list manager at any given time. The List-Id header field provides a standard location for such an identifier. In addition, a namespace for mailing list identifiers based on fully qualified domain names is described. This namespace is intended to guarantee uniqueness for list owners who require it, while allowing for a less rigorous namespace for experimental and personal use. By including the List-Id field, mailing list managers can make it easier for mail user agents to provide automated tools for users to perform mailing list functions. The mailing list identifier can serve as a key for automated processing tasks</t>
