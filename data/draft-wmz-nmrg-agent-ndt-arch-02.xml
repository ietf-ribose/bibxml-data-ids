    <abstract>
      <t>A Network Digital Twin (NDT) provides a network emulation tool usable for different purposes such as scenario planning, impact analysis, and change management. Integrating a Network Digital Twin into network management together with AI, it allows the network management activities to take user intent or service requirements as input, automatically assess, model, and refine optimization strategies under realistic conditions but in a risk-free environment. Such environment that operates to meet these types of requirements is said to have AI driven Network Operations. AI driven Network Operations brings together existing technologies such as Network Digital Twin and AI which may be seen as the use of a toolbox of existing components enhanced with a few new elements. This document describes an architecture for AI driven network operations and shows how these components work together. It provides a cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy the architecture and realize intent-based networking to meet the needs of the network service.</t>
