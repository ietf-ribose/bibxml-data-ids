      <t>It is complex to support deterministic forwarding in a large scale network because there is too much dynamic traffic in the network and the data model becomes hard to predict after aggregation in the intermediate nodes. This document introduces the problem of micro- bursts in layer3 network, and analyses the method to decrease the micro-bursts in layer3 network for low-latency traffic.</t>
