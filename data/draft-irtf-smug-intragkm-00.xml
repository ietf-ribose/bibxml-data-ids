      <t>This document describes a protocol for intra-domain group key management for IP multicast security, based on the framework of [HCD00]. In order to support multicast groups, the domain is divided into a number of administratively-scoped 'areas'. A host-member of a multicast group is defined to reside within one (and only one) of these areas. The purpose of placing host-members in areas is to achieve flexible and efficient key management, particularly in the face of the problem of changes (joining, leaving, ejections) in the membership of a multicast group. A separate administratively-scoped area control-group is defined for each (data) multicast group, for the express purpose of key management and other control-message delivery.</t>
