      <t>This document describes a protocol for intra-domain group keymanagement for IP multicast security, based on the framework of[HCD00]. In order to support multicast groups, the domain is dividedinto a number of administratively-scoped 'areas'. A host-member ofa multicast group is defined to reside within one (and only one) ofthese areas. The purpose of placing host-members in areas is toachieve flexible and efficient key management, particularly in theface of the problem of changes (joining, leaving, ejections) in themembership of a multicast group. A separate administratively-scopedarea control-group is defined for each (data) multicast group, forthe express purpose of key management and other control-messagedelivery.</t>
