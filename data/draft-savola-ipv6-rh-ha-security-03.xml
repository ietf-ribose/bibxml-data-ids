    <abstract>
      <t>All IPv6 nodes must be able to process Routing Header [IPV6] and Home Address [MIPV6] Options. With these, packet filter access lists can be tricked (among other things) as the destination and source addresses, respectively, are being rewritten as the packet traverses the network. Some of the security considerations of these features are analyzed, and a few possible solutions presented. It will be shown that with the current architecture, the network-based security does not seem to scale to the requirements of Mobile IPv6; it seems possible that unless security is taken seriously when implementing the nodes, the new Mobile IPv6 requirements might not be allowed to be used at all in some circumstances.</t>
