      <t>All IPv6 nodes must be able to process Routing Header [IPV6] and HomeAddress [MIPV6] Options. With these, packet filter access lists canbe tricked (among other things) as the destination and sourceaddresses, respectively, are being rewritten as the packet traversesthe network. Some of the security considerations of these featuresare analyzed, and a few possible solutions presented. It will beshown that with the current architecture, the network-based securitydoes not seem to scale to the requirements of Mobile IPv6; it seemspossible that unless security is taken seriously when implementingthe nodes, the new Mobile IPv6 requirements might not be allowed tobe used at all in some circumstances.</t>
