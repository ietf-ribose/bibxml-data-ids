    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes to extend the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) Quality of Service (QoS) model to support energy-efficient networking. As a first draft, it discusses how such extensions could be done, bringing first examples of energy-efficiency metrics that could be applied to mark traffic, and providing routing applicability examples by interpreting existing or experimental DSCP codepoints to represent not only traditional QoS parameters (e.g., latency, jitter), but also application-level energy sensitivity. By incorporating energy metrics into traffic classification, network devices and orchestrators can make routing and resource allocation decisions that optimize both service performance and energy consumption.</t>
