      <t>This file is a proposal for P2P based Domain Name query strategy in IpV6. The DNS servers construct n-tuple overlay virtual hierarchical overlay network. With cached addresses of DNS servers, the overload of traffic in tree structure can be avoided and more security can be enhanced due to the random lookup paths. This strategy may use for Domain Name query and reverse Domain Name query in IpV6 for a large number of domain names.</t>
