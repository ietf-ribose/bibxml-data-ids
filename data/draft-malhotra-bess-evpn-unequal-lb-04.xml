    <abstract>
      <t>In an EVPN-IRB based network overlay, EVPN LAG enables all-active multi-homing for a host or CE device connected to two or more PEs via a LAG bundle, such that bridged and routed traffic from remote PEs can be equally load balanced (ECMPed) across the multi-homing PEs. This document defines extensions to EVPN procedures to optimally handle unequal access bandwidth distribution across a set of multi- homing PEs in order to: o provide greater flexibility, with respect to adding or removing individual PE-CE links within the access LAG o handle PE-CE LAG member link failures that can result in unequal PE-CE access bandwidth across a set of multi-homing PEs</t>
