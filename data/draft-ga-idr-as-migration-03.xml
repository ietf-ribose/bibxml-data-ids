      <t>This draft discusses common methods of managing an ASN migration using some BGP feaures that while commonly-used are not formally part of the BGP4 protocol specification and may be vendor-specific in exact implementation. It is necessary to document these de facto standards to ensure that they are properly supported in future BGP protocol work such as BGPSec.</t>
