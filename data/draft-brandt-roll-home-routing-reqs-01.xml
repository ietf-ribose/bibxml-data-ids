      <t>This document presents home control and automation application specific requirements for ROuting in Low power and Lossy networks (ROLL). In a modern home, a high number of wireless devices are used for a wide set of purposes. Examples include lighting control, heating control, sensors, leak detectors, healthcare systems and advanced remote controls. Because such devices only cover a limited radio range, multi-hop routing is often required. The aim of this document is to specify the routing requirements for networks comprising such constrained devices in a home network environment.</t>
