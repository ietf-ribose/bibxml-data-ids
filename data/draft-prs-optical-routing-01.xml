    <abstract>
      <t>The objective of this draft is to describe mechanisms for exchanging routing information between IP routers and optical networks, and between optical sub-networks. Such information exchange would allow automated establishment of end-to-end paths in an optical network comprising of multiple sub-networks. Furthermore, it would allow optical network clients, specifically IP routers, to discover their remote peers dynamically. Determination of reachability could be the first step in dynamic provisioning of optical paths using signaling. (A postscript version of this draft with figures is available as draft-optical-routing-00.ps).</t>
