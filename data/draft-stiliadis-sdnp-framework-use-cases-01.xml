    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents an application framework and associated use cases to help define the scope of the SDNP working group. The use cases start with an abstract representation of a multi-tier application and illustrate the composition of a network service that can meet the requirements of the particular application. The service composition process is split into several steps, including application requirement specification, network mapping, service binding, and policy control. We also provide examples of interactions between an SDNP controller and L2 and L3 control layer protocols in order to deliver the end-to-end service. Finally, as a derivate of that, an architecture framework for SDNP that meets these requirements is proposed.</t>
