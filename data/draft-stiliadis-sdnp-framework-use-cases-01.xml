      <t>This document presents an application framework and associated usecases to help define the scope of the SDNP working group. The use casesstart with an abstract representation of a multi-tier application andillustrate the composition of a network service that can meet therequirements of the particular application. The service compositionprocess is split into several steps, including application requirementspecification, network mapping, service binding, and policy control. Wealso provide examples of interactions between an SDNP controller and L2and L3 control layer protocols in order to deliver the end-to-endservice. Finally, as a derivate of that, an architecture framework forSDNP that meets these requirements is proposed.</t>
