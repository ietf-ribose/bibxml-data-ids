      <t>The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), standardized in 2009, has served the domain name industry well for domain name management. However, advancements in development, integration, and operational paradigms have led to a desire for a provisioning protocol leveraging the REST architectural style and JSON data-interchange format. This document defines the architecture for the RESTful Provisioning Protocol (RPP), aiming to standardize a REST-based protocol for provisioning services, initially focused on domain name, host, and contact management, while allowing for future extensibility. RPP is intended to co-exist with EPP, offering a modern alternative benefiting from the REST architectural style and widely adopted technologies. RPP aims for data model compatibility with EPP core objects.</t>
