      <t>Neighbor Discovery (ND) is the key protocol of IPv6 first-hop. ND uses multicast extensively and trusts all hosts. In some scenarios like wireless networks, multicast can be inefficient. In other scenarios like public access networks, hosts may not be trustable. Consequently, ND issues may happen in various scenarios. The issues and solutions are documented in more than 30 RFCs. It is difficult to keep track of all these issues and solutions, and how the various solutions fit together. Therefore, deployment guidelines are needed. This document firstly summarizes the known ND issues and optimization solutions into a one-stop reference. Analyzing these solutions reveals an insight: isolating hosts is effective in solving ND issues. Four isolation methods are proposed and their applicability is discussed. Guidelines are then described for selecting a suitable isolation method based on the deployment scenario.</t>
