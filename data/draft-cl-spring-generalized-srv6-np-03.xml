      <t>As the deployment of SRv6, some new requirements are proposed, such as SRv6 compression, transporting over SR-MPLS/MPLS and IPv4 domains. Therefore, it is necessary to consider other types of segments or sub-paths in the end-to-end SRv6 network programming. This document proposes Generalized Segment Routing over IPv6 (G-SRv6) Networking Programming, which supports to encode multiple types of Segments in a SRH, called Generalized SRH (G-SRH). These Segments can be called Generalized Segment, and the ID can be Generalized Segment Identifier (G-SID), which may include an SRv6 SID(128 bits), C-SIDs, MPLS labels, or IPv4 tunnel information. This document also defines the mechanisms of Generalized SRv6 Networking Programming and the requirements of related protocol extensions of control plane and data plane.</t>
