    <abstract>
      <t>This draft specifies OAM messages to indicate service disruptive conditions for MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). The notification mechanism employs a generic method for a service disruptive condition to be communicated to a Maintenance End Point (MEP). An MPLS Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) channel is defined along with messages to communicate various types of service disruptive conditions.
