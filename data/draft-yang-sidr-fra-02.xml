    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes Fast Route Attestation (FRA), an efficient mechanism for securing AS paths and preventing prefix hijacking by signing and verifying critical AS path segments (i.e., adjacent AS triples along AS path). When full-deployed, FRA can achieve similar level of security as S-BGP/BGPSec, but with much higher efficiency. Besides, when partial-deployed, FRA offers more security benefits than BGPSec, promoting ISPs to deploy the security mechanism.</t>
