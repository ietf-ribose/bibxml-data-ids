    <abstract>
      <t>Bundled session applications such as FTP, H.323, SIP and RTSP, which use a signaling/control connection to establish a data/media flow, are usually broken, en-route, by Middleboxes such as NAT. Midcom proposes to solve this problem by allowing the Middlebox to be controlled through a generalized control interface by an application-aware entity called Midcom Agent. Since ubiquitous deployment of Midcom is still a few years away, an interim solution is needed to allow applications traverse NAT and Firewalls seamlessly without the help of embedded Application Layer Gateways (ALG). In this draft, a pre-Midcom solution framework is developed. A solution for the problem of NAT/FW traversal is needed both for the signaling and media/data paths. Two key components of the proposed solution are: (1) a Signaling Proxy server on the signaling path, and (2) a Media Proxy server on the media path. The Signaling server interacts with the Media server through a control interface. Although the primary applicability of this framework is shown for real-time RTP/UDP-based SIP multimedia sessions, these concepts should be generally applicable to other types of data sessions established through a control connection.</t>
