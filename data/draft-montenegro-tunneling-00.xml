      <t>The Mobile IP specification uses tunneling from the home agent to the mobile node, but rarely in the reverse direction. Usually, a mobile node sends its packets through a router in the foreign net, and assumes that routing is independent of source address. When this assumption is not true, it is convenient to establish topologically correct bi-directional tunnels between the home agent and the mobile node's care-of address. This document proposes backwards-compatible extensions to Mobile IP in order to support topologically correct bi-directional tunnels. This document does not attempt to solve the problems posed by firewalls located between the home agent and the mobile node's care-of address.</t>
