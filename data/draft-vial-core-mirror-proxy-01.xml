      <t>The Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) working group aims at realizing the REpresentational State Transfer (REST) architecture in a suitable form for the most constrained nodes. Thanks to the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), REST is now applicable to constrained networks. However the most energy-constrained devices may enter sleep mode and disconnect their network link during several minutes to save energy, hence preventing them from acting as traditional web servers. This document describes how a sleeping device can store resource representations in an entity called Mirror Server and participate in a constrained RESTful environment.</t>
