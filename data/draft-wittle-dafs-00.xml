      <t>The Direct Access File System (DAFS) is a file access and management protocol designed for local file-sharing or clustered environments. It addresses two primary goals: o Provide low-latency, high-throughput, and low-overhead data movement that takes advantage of modern memory-to-memory networking technology. o Define a set of file management and file access operations for local file-sharing requirements.</t>
