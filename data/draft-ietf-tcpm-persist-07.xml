      <t>This document clarifies the Zero Window Probes (ZWPs) described in RFC 1122 ("Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers"). In particular, it clarifies the actions that can be taken on connections that are experiencing the ZWP condition. Rather than making a change to the standard, this document clarifies what has been until now a misinterpretation of the standard as specified in RFC 1122. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>
