    <abstract>
      <t>The early policy for the RFC Series was that RFCs could only contain characters from the ASCII character set. Later policy, from RFC 7997, allowed more characters and enforced an encoding for RFCs of UTF-8. Since RFC 7997 was published, the IETF community has had much more experience of using non-ASCII characters in RFCs. The policy for the RFC Series is that all displayable text is allowed as long as the reader of an RFC can interpret that text. This policy does not change language policy of the RFC Series, namely that English is the required language for the series. This document obsoletes RFC 7997 and updates the RFC Style Guide (RFC 7322). [[ A repository for this draft can be found here (https://github.com/ paulehoffman/7997bis). ]]</t>
