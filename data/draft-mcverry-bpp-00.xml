      <t>This document defines the Bitcoin Price Protocol (BPP), a lightweight, peer-to-peer protocol for synchronising a high-confidence Bitcoin price across untrusted networks. Modeled after the Network Time Protocol (NTP, RFC 5905), BPP enables any Internet host to obtain a volume-weighted median USD/BTC price that is accurate to within a few dollars and fresh to within a few seconds, without trusting any single exchange, oracle, or API provider. BPP is deliberately off-chain, runs over UDP/QUIC, and requires no blockchain interaction. It is suitable for wallets, trading bots, payment processors, DeFi front-ends, and hardware devices that need "NTP-grade" price agreement.</t>
