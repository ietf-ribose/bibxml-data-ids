    <abstract>
      <t>The DNSSEC protocol makes use of various cryptographic algorithms to provide authentication of DNS data and proof of non-existence. To ensure interoperability between DNS resolvers and DNS authoritative servers, it is necessary to specify both a set of algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidelines to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations support. This document replaces and obsoletes RFC8624 and moves the canonical source of algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance for DNSSEC from RFC8624 to an IANA registry. This is done both to allow the list of requirements to be more easily updated, and to allow the list to be more easily referenced. Future extensions to this registry can be made under new, incremental update RFCs. This document also incorporates the revised IANA DNSSEC considerations from RFC9157. The document does not change the status (MUST, MAY, RECOMMENDED, etc.) of the algorithms listed in RFC8624; that is the work of future documents.</t>
