      <t>The end-to-end network one-way delay is an important performance indicator of the arising 5G network. One type of existing methods requires the end-to-end deployment of accurate clock synchronization mechanism, such as PTP or GPS, which results in relatively high deployment cost. Another type of existing methods uses round-trip delay measurements to estimate the one-way delay. However, since the delay of the downlink and uplink of the 5G network may be asymmetric, the accuracy is relatively low. This document introduces a method to accurately measure end-to-end network one-way delay using reference delay without deploying clock synchronization.</t>
