    <abstract>
      <t>Confidential computing is the protection of data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment. Confidential computing could provide integrity and confidentiality for users who want to run application and process data in that environment. When confidential computing is used in network like MEC and CAN which provide computing resource to network users, TEEP protocol could be used to provision network user's data and application in TEE environment in confidential computing resource. This document focuses on using TEEP to provision network user's data and application in confidential computing in such network. This document is a use case and extension of TEEP and could provide guidance for MEC, CAN and other scenarios to use confidential computing.</t>
