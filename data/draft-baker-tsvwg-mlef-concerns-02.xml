      <t>The Defense Information Systems Agency of the United States Department of Defense, with is contractors, has proposed a service architecture for military (NATO and related agencies) telephone systems. This is called the Assured Service, and is defined in two documents: 'Architecture for Assured Service Capabilities in Voice over IP' and 'Requirements for Assured Service Capabilities in Voice over IP'. Responding to these are four documents: 'Reason Header Field for the Session Initiation Protocol', 'Extending the Session Initiation Protocol Reason Header to account for Preemption Events', 'Communications Resource Priority for the Session Initiation Protocol', and the 'Multi-Level Expedited Forwarding Per Hop Behavior' (MLEF PHB). MLEF, as currently defined, has serious problems, which this draft seeks to discuss.</t>
