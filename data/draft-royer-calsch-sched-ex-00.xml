      <t>A proposal to specify booked persistent data in calendar stores to track'SEQUENCE' and 'DTSTAMP' property values for CUAs with direct access tocalendar stores.With iMIP the iCalendar CUA's do not see the others stored CS data. WithWebDAV, HTTP, or FTP access, the CUA can see into the public data ofother calendars. The storage of persistent data mandated by [iTIP] has not been standardized yet. This memo proposes a way to standardize onthose persistent items.Also included are ways to make the various ways of using the [iCAL] and[iTIP] 'RECURRENCE-ID' property work between vendors and to document theprocedures to work with 'RECURRENCE-ID's.</t>
