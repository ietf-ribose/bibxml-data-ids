      <t>This document proposes a framework for intelligent network measurement using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). By treating network devices as MCP servers and network controllers as MCP clients, this framework enables natural language-driven, AI-assisted network measurement operations. The framework leverages MCP's standardized communication protocol to provide real-time network performance monitoring, intelligent fault diagnosis, topology discovery, and automated measurement workflows. This document describes the architecture, use cases, and security considerations for implementing MCP-based network measurement systems.</t>
