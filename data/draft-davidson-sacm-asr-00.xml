      <t>This specification defines the Asset Summary Reporting (ASR), a data model for expressing the data exchange format of summary information relative to one or more metrics. ASR reduces the bandwidth requirement to report information about assets in the aggregate since it allows for reporting aggregates relative to metrics, as opposed to reporting data about each individual asset, which can lead to a bloated data exchange. ASR is vendor neutral and leverages widely adopted, open specifications; it is flexible, and suited for a wide variety of reporting applications.</t>
