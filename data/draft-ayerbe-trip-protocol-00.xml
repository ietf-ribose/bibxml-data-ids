      <t>This document specifies the Trajectory-based Recognition of Identity Proof (TRIP) protocol, a decentralized mechanism for establishing claims of physical-world presence through cryptographically signed, spatially quantized location attestations called "breadcrumbs." Breadcrumbs are chained into an append-only log, bundled into verifiable epochs, and distilled into a Trajectory Identity Token (TIT) that serves as a persistent pseudonymous identifier. Trust in a TIT accumulates through spatiotemporal diversity of the underlying trajectory rather than through biometric capture or centralized credential issuance. TRIP is designed to be transport-agnostic and operates independently of any particular naming system, blockchain, or application layer.</t>
