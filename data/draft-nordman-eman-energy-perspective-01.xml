      <t>This memo discusses applicability for energy management features tovarious types of devices and buildings. It describes the variety ofapplications that can use the EMAN energy framework and associatedMIB modules. P otential examples are building networks, home energygateway, etc. Finally, the document will also discuss relationshipsof the framework to other architectures and frameworks (such assmartgrid). The applicability statement will explain therelationship between the work in this WG and the other existingstandards such as those from the IEC, ANSI, DMTF, and others.</t>
