      <t>This specification defines a mechanism enabling Web sites to declare themselves accessible only via secure connections, and/or for users to be able to direct their user agent(s) to interact with given sites only over secure connections. This overall policy is referred to as HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). The policy is declared by Web sites via the Strict-Transport-Security HTTP Response Header Field, and/or by other means, e.g. user agent configuration.</t>
