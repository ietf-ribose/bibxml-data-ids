      <t>This document reserves a string (ALT) to be used as a TLD label in non-DNS contexts or for names that have no meaning in a global context. It also provides advice and guidance to developers developing alternate namespaces. [ Ed note: This document lives in GitHub at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-alt-tld. Issues and pull requests happily accepted. ] [ Question for Working Group. It has been proposed that the string.ALT should be replaced with something else e.g..NOT-DNS. As naming discussions in the IETF are always short, simple, and not controversial, we figured we should open these for discussion now. We would appreciate clear feedback on preference and rationale. ]</t>
