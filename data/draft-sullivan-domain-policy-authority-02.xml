      <t>Some entities on the Internet make inferences about the administrative relationships among Internet services based on the domain names at which those services are offered. At present, it is not possible to ascertain organizational administrative boundaries in the DNS; therefore such inferences can be erroneous. Mitigation strategies deployed so far will not scale. This memo provides a means to make explicit assertions regarding certain kinds of administrative relationships between domain names.</t>
