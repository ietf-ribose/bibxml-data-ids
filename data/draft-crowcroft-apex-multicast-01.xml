      <t>This is a memo that presents an approach to do application layermulticast. Our intention is to present a design that produces a treedistribution structure within the existing design structure of APEXand BEEP. It is not our intention to present a design that replacesmulticast at the network layer. Where the need exists (and inscenarios where it would seem symbiotic), we would find itconstructive to integrate the two technologies and perspective (i.e.,application later and network layer multicast).</t>
