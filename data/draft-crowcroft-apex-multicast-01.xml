      <t>This is a memo that presents an approach to do application layer multicast. Our intention is to present a design that produces a tree distribution structure within the existing design structure of APEX and BEEP. It is not our intention to present a design that replaces multicast at the network layer. Where the need exists (and in scenarios where it would seem symbiotic), we would find it constructive to integrate the two technologies and perspective (i.e., application later and network layer multicast).</t>
