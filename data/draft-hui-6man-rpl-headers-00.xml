      <t>Routing for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is a routing protocol designed for Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). RPL includes routing information in IPv6 data plane datagrams to help maintain the routing topology. When forwarding a datagram into a RPL domain, a RPL router may need to expand the datagram to include routing information in IPv6 Extension headers. A generic solution has been defined that uses IP-in-IP tunneling to include RPL routing information. This document describes an alternative to inserting and removing RPL information in datagrams without the use of IP-in-IP tunneling.</t>
