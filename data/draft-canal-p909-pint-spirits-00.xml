      <t>This document is intended to provide input to the IETF SPIRITSWorking Group(SPIRITS WG) and to the IETF PINT Working Group (PINTWG) from the viewpoint of European network operators that areinvolved in EURESCOM P909 Project 'Enabling Technologies for INEvolution and IN-Internet Integration'. The input is based on current results that were achieved in the project. As the project title says P909 project deals with IN-Internet integration issues. The projecthas defined an architecture for IN-Internet inte gration and it hasselected and described some IN-Internet services which can beinteresting from the business perspective and challenging from thetechnical perspective. Some of these services are 'officially' chartered in IETF: ICW inSPIRITS, Click-to-Dial (Request to Call) as well as proposedConference Service in PINT. However, there are additional IN-Internet convergence services that P909 studies and that are included in thisdocument only as examples.</t>
