      <t>This document is intended to provide input to the IETF SPIRITS Working Group(SPIRITS WG) and to the IETF PINT Working Group (PINT WG) from the viewpoint of European network operators that are involved in EURESCOM P909 Project 'Enabling Technologies for IN Evolution and IN-Internet Integration'. The input is based on current results that were achieved in the project. As the project title says P909 project deals with IN-Internet integration issues. The project has defined an architecture for IN-Internet inte gration and it has selected and described some IN-Internet services which can be interesting from the business perspective and challenging from the technical perspective. Some of these services are 'officially' chartered in IETF: ICW in SPIRITS, Click-to-Dial (Request to Call) as well as proposed Conference Service in PINT. However, there are additional IN-Internet convergence services that P909 studies and that are included in this document only as examples.</t>
