      <t>This document contains additions to the R. Perlman's draft Understanding IKEv2: Tutorial, and rationale for decisions. Its purpose is to request for comments and to incorporate it into draft-ietf-ipsec-ikev2-tutorial-01. This document describes some of controversial issues discussed on the IPsec mailing list and described in various IETF documents that were written after the publication of draft-ietf-ipsec-ikev2-tutorial-01. Its additional purpose is to explain some of IKEv2 protocol parts that were not described in draft-ietf-ipsec-ikev2-tutorial-01. It follows the original R. Perlman draft's concept to be both a tutorial for understanding IKEv2 and a summary of IKEv2 issues.</t>
