    <title>Organizing Mobile IP Along Natural Architectural Boundaries</title>
    <date year="2003" month="February" day="25"/>
    <abstract>
      <t>A natural architectural split exists in Mobile IP between the mechanisms involved in global routing change and the mechanisms involved in local link routing change. The global mechanisms modify the mapping between a Mobile Node's routing identifier (care of address) and its global node identifier (home address). The local mechanisms allow the Mobile Node to obtain IP connectivity on the subnet and provide measures to locally mitigate routing failure while the global routing change is occurring. This draft makes a case for keeping the mechanisms involved in these two architectural components distinct and separate in Mobile IPv6, and suggests that the Mobile IP group might want to think about a separate working group specifically focused on local link routing changes for mobility in Mobile IPv6.</t>
