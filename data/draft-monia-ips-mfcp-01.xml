      <t>This document describes mFCP, a UDP-based [UDP] implementation of the iFCP Fibre Channel Protocol [iFCP] over metro- and local-scale IP networks. These networks are provisioned to have latency, reliability, and performance levels comparable to that of a Fibre Channel network. Storage devices use the Fibre Channel SCSI mapping in [FCP] for data transport and error recovery. mFCP leverages these existing mechanisms to facilitate high-performance interconnection of Fibre Channel- based storage devices over suitably provisioned IP networks. As in the case of iFCP, fibre channel frames may be transported natively over such a network without Fibre Channel switching and routing elements.</t>
