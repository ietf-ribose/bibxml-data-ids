      <t>This document describes the server-based threading extension to the IMAP4rev1 protocol. This extension provides substantial performance improvements for IMAP clients which offer threaded views. A server which supports this extension indicates this with more or more capability names consisting of 'THREAD-' followed by a supported threading algorithm name as described in this document. This provides for future upwards-compatible extensions.</t>
