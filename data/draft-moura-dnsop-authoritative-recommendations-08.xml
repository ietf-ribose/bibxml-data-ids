    <abstract>
      <t>Recent research work has explored the deployment characteristics and configuration of the Domain Name System (DNS). This document summarizes the conclusions from these research efforts and offers specific, tangible advice to operators when configuring authoritative DNS servers. It is possible that the results presented in this document could be applicable in a wider context than just the DNS protocol, as some of the results may generically apply to any stateless/short-duration, anycasted service. This document is not an IETF consensus document: it is published for informational purposes.</t>
