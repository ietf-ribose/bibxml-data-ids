      <t>This document describes a transformation method for representing non-ASCII characters in host name parts in a fashion that is completely compatible with the current DNS. It is a potential candidate for an ASCII-Compatible Encoding (ACE) for internationalized host names, as described in the comparison document from the IETF IDN Working Group. This method is based exclusively on long-established mechanisms for denoting the positions of characters in tables, but included variations for compressing that information, also based on long-established mechanisms.</t>
