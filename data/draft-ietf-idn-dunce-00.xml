      <t>This document describes a transformation method for representingnon-ASCII characters in host name parts in a fashion that iscompletely compatible with the current DNS. It is a potentialcandidate for an ASCII-Compatible Encoding (ACE) forinternationalized host names, as described in the comparisondocument from the IETF IDN Working Group. This method is basedexclusively on long-established mechanisms for denoting thepositions of characters in tables, but included variations forcompressing that information, also based on long-establishedmechanisms.</t>
