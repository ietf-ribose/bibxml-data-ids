      <t>In SIP, Register message normally don't carry message body, but a lot of things can be simplified by putting the one. User can configure their call preferences at any moment by just sending a Register message. In present scenario when users are becoming more and more demanding it's perfectly logical to allow them to configure their call preferences dynamically. The present draft present two such call preferences requested by user - call barring and advertising unavailability. It can, however, be extended for other scenarios as well.</t>
