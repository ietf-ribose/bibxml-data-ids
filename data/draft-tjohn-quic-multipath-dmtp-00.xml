    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes the Deadline-aware Multipath Transport Protocol (DMTP) concept as an extension to the Multipath Extension for QUIC (MP-QUIC). This extension aims to support data streams with strict latency requirements by enabling the signaling of a stream's deadline and by combining multipath scheduling, congestion control adaptations, and optional forward error correction (FEC). Moreover, DMTP leverages MP-QUIC's path identifiers to distinguish different end-to-end paths as they may be offered in a Path Aware Network (PAN) such as SCION. This allows an application to select its preferred paths while maintaining interoperability with standard MP-QUIC endpoints. In combination, DMTP enables endpoints to exchange and schedule deadline-aware streams across multiple network paths.</t>
