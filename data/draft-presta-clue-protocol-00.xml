      <t>This is a work-in-progress draft aimed at shedding light on the application-level protocol associated with the creation and management of a CLUE-enabled telepresence session between a Media Consumer and a Media Provider. The draft sketches the high-level interactions occurring between the above mentioned entities, as well as depicts the state transitions occurring at both ends during a telepresence session.</t>
