      <t>This draft describes a BGP Extension to protect the route information on the basis of authentication on the BGP message between BGP speakers,In this mechanism,an addtional Capabilty option(Authentication Code) and random number used for authentication are added to OPEN message,and the Authentication Capability is negotiated between BGP speakers,when they pass the negotiation and setup the Established relationship, all the successive message will be authenticated using MD5 algorithm,with the Marker field in the BGP message substituted with the MD5 digest of the combination including message body.This mechanism can guard against that the BGP message be intercepted and tampered by the attacker.</t>
