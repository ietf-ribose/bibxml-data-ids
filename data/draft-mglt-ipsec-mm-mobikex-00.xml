      <t>This draft provides a description of MOBIKE mobility and multihoming extension (MOBIKE-X). The extension is elaborated from the MOBIKE [RFC4555] protocol as well as mobility and multihoming requirements described in [I-D.mglt-ipsec-mm-requirements]. Extension concerns the Security Association facilities in a multihoming and mobile environment. More specifically this draft considers the use of multiple interfaces and the transport mode of IPsec. One of the goal of this draft was to make this extension compatible with MOBIKE [RFC4555]. We especially point out the differences from MOBIKE [RFC4555], as well as how its interacts with MOBIKE.</t>
