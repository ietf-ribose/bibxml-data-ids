      <t>Many real world problems require implementing and deploying cryptography as part of the solution. In general, there is no single standard or set of requirements by which applications determine what type of cryptographic solution is best for their problem. Different applications and deployments can lead to varying tradeoffs in computation, memory, network, and bandwidth properties of a solution. Moreover, practical aspects of modern software engineering, especially around long-term maintenance costs, may influence what type of cryptographic solutions are deployed in practice. This document attempts to cover different factors that influence what type of cryptography is deployed in practice with the goal of helping cryptographic researchers navigate the tradeoffs and assumptions made in new and emerging work.</t>
