      <t>MessageVortex Protocol is a protocol to achieve different degrees of anonymity. It specifies messages embedded within existing transfer protocols such as SMTP or XMPP to send them via peer nodes to one or more recipients. The protocol outperforms other protocols by decoupling transport from the final transmitter and receiver party. There is no trust put into any infrastructure except for the infrastructure of the sending and receiving party of a message. The creator of the routing block has full control over the message flow. Routing nodes gain no non- obvious knowledge about messages even when collaborating. Third- party anonymity is always achieved. Furthermore, the protocol allows achieving either sender or receiver anonymity.</t>
