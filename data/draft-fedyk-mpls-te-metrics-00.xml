      <t>There has recently been a lot of activity in defining the componentsfor MPLS-based traffic engineering. This includes the recentextensions of the Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) to carry metricsand resource class information about links. This memo exploresadditional metrics that are useful for traffic engineering. We alsodescribe some of the subtleties associated with the use of theresource class (or color) vector that has been defined in the IGPextensions.</t>
