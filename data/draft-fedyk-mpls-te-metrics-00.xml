      <t>There has recently been a lot of activity in defining the components for MPLS-based traffic engineering. This includes the recent extensions of the Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) to carry metrics and resource class information about links. This memo explores additional metrics that are useful for traffic engineering. We also describe some of the subtleties associated with the use of the resource class (or color) vector that has been defined in the IGP extensions.</t>
