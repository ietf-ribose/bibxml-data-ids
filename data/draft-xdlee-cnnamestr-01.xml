      <t>There are many requirements of developing internationalized and human-readable Internet identifiers/names now, thereby there are many systems based on DNS technology to meet such requirements. John C. Klensin has proposed a three-layer search-based access model for the DNS [DNSSEARCH]; this paper is only to explain some related problems mentioned in John C. Klensin's proposal. Especially it focuses on Traditional and Simplified Chinese problems and some other special Chinese requirements. The ultimate goal for any kinds of search-based access system is to help users to access network resources in more natural ways, which have different meaning for different user groups. On the premise of respecting Chinese user's language convention, it is very important for a valuable and human-friendly system to deal with traditional and simplified Chinese equivalence problems.</t>
