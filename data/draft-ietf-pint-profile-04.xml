      <t>This document contains the specification of the PINT Profile 1.0, which defines a protocol for invoking certain telephone services from an IP network. These services include placing basic calls, sending and receiving faxes, and receiving content over the telephone. The protocol is specified as a set of enhancements and additions to the SIP 2.0 and SDP 2.0 protocols. This document is intended for the PSTN-Internet Interworking (PINT) working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at pint@lists.research.bell-labs.com and/or the authors.</t>
