      <t>HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) is an HTTP authentication method with credentials that are not vulnerable to simple phishing attacks, and that does not require a server-side password database. It is an alternative to HTTP authentication that requires passwords and all the negative attributes that come with password-based systems. HOBA can be integrated with account management and other applications running over HTTP and supports portability, so a user can associate more than one device or origin-bound certificate with the same service. HOBA has many other useful features such as a mechanism to handle state-loss if one of a user's credentials is lost and a logout mechanism.</t>
