    <abstract>
      <t>Open Caching architecture is a use case of Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI) in which the commercial Content Delivery Network (CDN) is the upstream CDN (uCDN) and the ISP caching layer serves as the downstream CDN (dCDN). This document extends the Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement Interface (FCI) defined in RFC8008, to allow advertising of named footprint objects, that can be referenced in a consistent manner from Metadata Interface (MI), also defined in RFC8006, as well as from the FCI itself as well as additional interfaces in the Open Caching architecture. This document also supplements the CDNI Metadata Footprint Types defined in RFC8006 and modifies the CDNI operation as described in RFC7336.</t>
