      <t>This document describes requirements for Localized Mobility Management (LMM) for Mobile IP and Mobile Ipv6 protocols. These requirements are intended to guide the design of a protocol specification for LMM. Localized Mobility Management, in general, introduces enhancements to Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6 to reduce the amount of latency in binding updates sent to the Home Agent and, for route-optimization, Correspondent Nodes, upon Care of Address change. In addition, LMM seeks to reduce the amount of signaling over the global Internet when a mobile node traverses within a defined local domain. The identified requirements are essential for localized mobility management functionality. They are intended to be used as a guide for analysis on the observed benefits over the identified requirements for architecting and deploying LMM schemes.</t>
