      <t>This document describes SILK, a speech codec for real-time, packet-based voice communications. Targeting a diverse range of operatingenvironments, SILK provides scalability in several dimensions. Fourdifferent sampling frequencies are supported for encoding the audioinput signal. Adaptation to network characteristics is providedthrough control of bitrate, packet rate, packet loss resilience anduse of discontinuous transmission (DTX). And several differentcomplexity levels let SILK take advantage of available processingpower without relying on it. Each of these properties can beadjusted during operation of the codec on a frame-by-frame basis.</t>
