      <t>This Internet Draft describes a new Standards Action BGP community,LAST_RESORT.This community provides a simple and easily deployable solution to acertain class of BGP "wedgies".Initial deployment is expected to be achieved by voluntary use in thenetwork operator community-at-large.Long-term adoption via software enforcement of the community, willimprove global behavior, and simplify router configurations.The Standards Action range of communities (previously limited to the"well-known" communities) ensures that the expectation of (eventual)router support is reasonable.</t>
