      <t>This document reviews the security threats associated with the twocurrent work items of the ECRIT Working Group. The first is themarking of signalling messages to indicate that they are related toan emergency. The second is the process of mapping from locations toUniversal Resource Identifiers (URIs) pointing to Public SafetyAnswering Points (PSAPs). This mapping occurs as part of the processof routing emergency calls through the IP network. Based on thethreats, this document establishes a set of security requirements forthe the mapping protocol and for the handling of emergency-markedcalls.</t>
