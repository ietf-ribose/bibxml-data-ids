      <t>To solve the inefficient route problem of PMIPv6, a variety ofmechanisms were proposed. The mechanism was also proposed to supportPMIPv6 RO handover according mobile node's movements. EfficientPMIPv6 RO handover SHOULD be considered to reduce handover latencyand to support communication with route optimization disabled mobilenode's remote node. In this draft, we proposed a mechanism that cansolve handover latency in PMIPv6 RO handover. And we introduce a fewof messages to apply proposed mechanism.</t>
