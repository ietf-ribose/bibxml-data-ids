      <t>This draft wants to review the existing research and the open issues that relate to the addition of data plane programmability in Data Center. While some of the research hypotheses that are at the center of in-network-computing have been investigated since the time of active networking, recent developments in software defined networking, virtualization programmable switches and new network programming languages like P4 have generated a new enthusiasm in the research community and a flourish of new projects in systems and applications alike. This is what this draft is addressing.</t>
