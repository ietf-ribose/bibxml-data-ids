      <t>We define a REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) Usage for Application-Layer Multicast (ALM) as well as a mapping to the RELOAD experimental message type to support ALM. The ALM Usage is intended to support a variety of ALM control algorithms in an overlay-independent way. Two example algorithms are defined, based on Scribe and P2PCast. This document is a product of the Scalable Adaptive Multicast Research Group (SAM RG).</t>
