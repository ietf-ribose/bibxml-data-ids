      <t>We introduce Enhanced Forwarding from the Previous Care-of Address (eFWD) for fast handovers in Mobile IPv6. eFWD enables a mobile node to create and directly control a bi-directional tunnel between the mobile node’s previous and new subnet’s access routers subsequent to a link layer handover. eFWD reduces handover latency by expediting the mobile node’s movement detection and new subnet’s access router discovery via proposed Candidate Access Router Information Discovery (CARID) method and by eliminating time to acquire a new care-of address. Main advantage of eFWD is complete removal of link layer pre-triggers that are extremely complex mechanisms to implement in wireless technologies other than cellular systems.</t>
