      <t>Before placing a call, it is quite often useful for the Caller to know whether a Callee is in favorable state to receive a call or not. This document defines an optional tag "continue" and a header "Continue" to address the purpose. The "Continue" header field is to confirm the session continuity with the Callee from the Caller after an option for session continuity is placed by the Callee based on the unfavorable state of the Callee. This functionality is needed to resolve the unwillingness of the Callee to receive any call. An option is given to the Callee by the Service Provider or by the Handset Manufacturer or by the Carrier to establish this requirement.</t>
