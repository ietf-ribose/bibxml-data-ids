      <t>In 5G core network, all network functions are componentized,virtualized and grouped into VNF. Network management system will managethe functions based on VNF. This document presents YANG model proposalon overall structure of cloud native 5G core network. The structure isitself represented as an example YANG model, with all of the relatedcomponent models logically organized in a way that is operationallyintuitive, but this model is not expected to be implemented. Theidentified component modules are expected to be defined andimplemented.</t>
