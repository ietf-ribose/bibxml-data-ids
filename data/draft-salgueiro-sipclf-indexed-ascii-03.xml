      <t>The SIPCLF Workgroup has defined a common log format framework for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) servers. This common log format mimics the wildly successful event logging mechanism found in well- known web servers like Apache and web proxies like Squid. This document proposes an indexed text encoding format for the SIP Common Log Format (CLF) that retains the key advantages of a text-based format, while significantly increasing processing performance over a purely text-based implementation. This file format adheres to the SIP CLF data model and provides an effective encoding scheme for all mandatory and optional fields that appear in a SIP CLF record.</t>
