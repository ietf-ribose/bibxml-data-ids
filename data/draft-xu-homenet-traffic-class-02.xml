      <t>Home IT staff is generally unfamiliar with network operations, making it desirable to provide a configuration-free mode of operation. Policy-based routing (in the sense of configuring one router to redirect traffic to another based on access control) and multi- topology routing both require configuration, making them undesirable. In this document, we propose a configuration-free mechanism, in which packets will be routed towards the corresponding upstream ISPs based on both destination and source addresses.</t>
