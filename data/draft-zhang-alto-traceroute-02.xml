    <abstract>
      <t>Most P2P system performance suffers from the mismatch between the randomly constructed overlays topology and the underlying physical network topology, causing a large burden in the ISP and a long RTT time. This document describes how DHT overlay peers can interact with the routers by traceroute to get the path information, and execute 2- Means Classification, thereafter peers leverage the DHT itself to build efficient "closer" cluster. This scheme only requires the infrastructure to enable traceroute queries.</t>
