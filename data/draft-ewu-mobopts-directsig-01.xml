      <t>In Mobile IPv6, mobile nodes must complete Return Routability Procedure and binding process before route optimization for data packet transmission is performed. This requires signaling exchange between the mobile and correspondent node. For the current specification, signaling is restricted to be routed to the mobile's and correspondent node's home addresses. This document describes a mechanism to enable mobile and correspondent nodes to send the signaling packets directly to their care-of addresses.</t>
