      <t>Since small devices such as sensors are often required to bephysically small and inexpensive, an implementation of the Internetprotocols will have to deal with having limited computing resourcesand memory. This report describes the design and implementation of asmall TCP/IP stack called lwIP that is small enough to be used inminimal systems.</t>
