    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a series of cryptographic wide-block permutations referred to as Areion-256 and Areion-512. These permutations are constructed using AES round operations and are designed for ultra-low latency implementations on modern processors with AES instructions. The Areion permutations can be used as building blocks in various cryptographic constructions, including authenticated encryption and hashing of relatively short input data. Additionally, it describes AEAD schemes and hash functions constructed from Areion.</t>
