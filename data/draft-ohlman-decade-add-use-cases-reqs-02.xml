      <t>The DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) working group is specifying standardized interfaces for accessing in-network storage from applications to store, retrieve and manage data. The main objective is to provide a framework that is useful to P2P applications, without excluding other, possibly related applications that can benefit from accessing in-network storage. This memo presents Internet TV as a specific application scenario where access to in-netork storage would be required and lists a set of concrete requirements that should be considered for the DECADE architecture and protocol specifications.</t>
