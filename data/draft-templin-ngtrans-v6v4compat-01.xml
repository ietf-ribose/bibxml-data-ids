      <t>This document specifies an IPv6-IPv4 compatibility aggregatable global unicast address format and its application for incremental IPv6 deployment for hosts and routers within predominantly IPv4-based Intranets. This document assumes that, during the IPv4 to IPv6 co- existence and transition phase, many sites will deploy IPv6 incrementally (not all at once) on hosts and routers within their pre-existing IPv4 interior routing domains; especially those sites which have large and complex pre-existing IPv4 infrastructures. In such cases, the address format and methods described in this document will enable IPv6 deployment for hosts and routers which do not share a common multiple access datalink with their default IPv6 gateways.</t>
