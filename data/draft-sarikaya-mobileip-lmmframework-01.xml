    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an architectural framework for mobility management (MM) in general with an emphasis on localized mobility management (LMM). MM requires new architectural entities to be added to the Internet Protocol version 4 and version 6. Also the availability of mobility management must be advertised by these entities extending ICMPv4 and v6. The document identifies these entities as routing proxies (RP) and defines abstractly the behaviour of RPs and their interactions with the existing entities and the router/agent advertisements that RP needs to issue in order to let its presence known. Basic architecture can be optimized by either informing the end nodes in order to achieve route optimization and/ or by localizing mobility management. LMM itself requires new entities identified as localized routing proxies or localized mobility agents (LMA) to be introduced to the basic architectures of mobility management. The behaviour of LMA is abstractly defined. The document also identifies a number of open issues whose resolution is crucial to the standardization of LMM protocols.</t>
