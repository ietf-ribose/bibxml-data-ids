    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposed a network-based mobility control scheme in wireless/mobile networks using the Locator-Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP). In the existing host-based mobility control, LISP Tunnel Router (TR) is implemented at mobile node. In the proposed scheme, each TR is implemented at the first-hop access router that mobile nodes are attached to in the wireless network. For network- based mobility control, we present the data delivery and handover control operations. It is expected that the proposed network-based scheme can reduce implementation overhead and handover latency of MN, compared to the existing host-based scheme.</t>
