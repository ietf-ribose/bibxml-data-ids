      <t>This document proposed a network-based mobility control scheme inwireless/mobile networks using the Locator-Identifier SeparationProtocol (LISP). In the existing host-based mobility control, LISPTunnel Router (TR) is implemented at mobile node. In the proposedscheme, each TR is implemented at the first-hop access router thatmobile nodes are attached to in the wireless network. For network-based mobility control, we present the data delivery and handovercontrol operations. It is expected that the proposed network-basedscheme can reduce implementation overhead and handover latency of MN,compared to the existing host-based scheme.</t>
