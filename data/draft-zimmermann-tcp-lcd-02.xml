      <t>Disruptions in end-to-end path connectivity which last longer thanone retransmission timeout cause suboptimal TCP performance. Thereason for the performance degradation is that TCP interprets segmentloss induced by connectivity disruptions as a sign of congestion,resulting in repeated backoffs of the retransmission timer. Thisleads in turn to a deferred detection of the re-establishment of theconnection since TCP waits until the next retransmission timeoutoccurs before attempting the retransmission.This document describes how standard ICMP messages can be exploitedto disambiguate true congestion loss from non-congestion loss causedby long connectivity disruptions. Moreover, a revert strategy of theretransmission timer is specified that enables a more promptdetection of whether the connectivity to a previously disconnectedpeer node has been restored or not. The specified algorithm is a TCPsender-only modification that effectively improves TCP performance inpresence of connectivity disruptions.</t>
