      <t>This document defines an extension to the CONNECT-UDP HTTP method that adds specific optimizations for QUIC connections that are proxied. This extension allows a proxy to reuse UDP 4-tuples for multiple connections. It also defines a mode of proxying in which QUIC short header packets can be forwarded through the proxy rather than being re-encapsulated and re-encrypted.</t>
