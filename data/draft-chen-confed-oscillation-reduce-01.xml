      <t>This document proposes a simple revision to Confederation that allows a BGP speaker in a Confederation to send a route advertisement (instead of a route withdraw) in certain cases. The route advertisement helps narrow the gap between Confederation and IBGP full-mesh in terms of routing information. It has been shown that the proposed mechanism helps achieve stable route selection and eliminate a number of persistent route oscillations involving Confederation.</t>
