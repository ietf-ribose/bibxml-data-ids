      <t>This document proposes a simple revision to Confederation that allowsa BGP speaker in a Confederation to send a route advertisement(instead of a route withdraw) in certain cases. The routeadvertisement helps narrow the gap between Confederation and IBGPfull-mesh in terms of routing information. It has been shown that theproposed mechanism helps achieve stable route selection and eliminatea number of persistent route oscillations involving Confederation.</t>
