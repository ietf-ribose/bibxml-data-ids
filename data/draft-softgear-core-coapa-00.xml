      <t>This document defines ASCII encoding method for Constrained Application Protocol(CoAP). CoAP has defined a binary encoding method to exchange requests and responses between constrained nodes or gateways. However, some communication modules in constrained nodes support ASCII data only. These modules are cheaper and widely deployed. To support these modules, this document describes the method to convert binary CoAP messages to base64 styled ASCII messages.</t>
