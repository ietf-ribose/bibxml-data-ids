      <t>The Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol has been proposed for use with IPv4 as a network-layer protocol linking together mobile nodes in an ad hoc network. It offers quick adaptation to dynamic link conditions, low processing and memory overhead, low network utilization, and determines unicast routes between sources and destinations. It uses destination sequence numbers to ensure loop freedom at all times. In this specification, we detail the necessary modifications to the messages given in the IPv4 specification so that AODV will be able to work for nodes using IPv6 addresses.</t>
