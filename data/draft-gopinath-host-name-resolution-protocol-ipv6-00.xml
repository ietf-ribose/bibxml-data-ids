      <t>This document describes a new method, which will automatically acquire the host name of active IPv6 nodes and register it to the local Domain Name System (DNS) server. Active IPv6 nodes are nodes that are connected to a network. Our proposed new protocol, which is called Host Name Resolution Protocol (HNRP) [6], will automatically learn some useful information from all the IPv6 nodes, such as the host name and the IP address. All the information will be kept by HRRP and the host name together with the IPv6 address will be added to the DNS. This will be implemented without the need for any changes at the clients' site. The objective of this document is to specify the new Host Name Resolution Protocol and also the algorithm used in the protocol.</t>
