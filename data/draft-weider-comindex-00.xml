      <t>This protocol is designed to allow general indexing from most of the attribute-value based directory services. It is an extension of the current WHOIS++ indexing protocol. Also, this protocol is designed to be implemented in such a way as to allow many different types of protocols (X.500, WHOIS++, SOLO, LDAP, etc) to use a basic server which speaks all these protocols.</t>
