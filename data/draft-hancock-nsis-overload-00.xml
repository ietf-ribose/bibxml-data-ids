      <t>The NSIS working group is considering protocols for signaling for resources for a traffic flow along its path in the network. The requirements for such signaling are being developed in [2] and a framework in [3]. The framework describes a 2-layer protocol architecture, with a common lower NSIS 'transport' layer protocol (NTLP) supporting a variety of upper layer NSIS signaling layer protocols (NSLPs). It is an open issue where within this architecture to place the responsibility for handling overload conditions. These conditions relate both to overload of the IP layer itself, as well as overload of buffer/processing resources within the NTLP/NSLPs. This note discusses the requirements and the implications of various approaches, and proposes a way forwards.</t>
