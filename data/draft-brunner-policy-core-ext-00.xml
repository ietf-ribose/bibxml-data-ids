      <t>This memo should help starting the discussion on extensions of the Policy Framework Core Information Model (PCIM). It does not replace nor change concepts used in PCIM, but tries to add concepts, which could help different application areas to define policies more easily by reusing some of the concepts proposed in this draft. The draft basically tries to generalize concepts introduced by other drafts such as the Policy Framework QoS Information Model [PQIM]. The focus lies in means for specifying general conditions and actions. Additionally, group ordering, events, and variables are introduced.</t>
