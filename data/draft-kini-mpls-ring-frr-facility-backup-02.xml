      <t>Fast Re-route (FRR) using facility backup is a widely deployed MPLSprotection mechanism that can protect against link and node failure.It provides a fast protection switch mechanism to minimize trafficloss (typically sub 50msec) if the node that detects the failurelocally, does the repair by re-routing the protected traffic to goover the backup tunnel. A direct application of this mechanism to aring topology results in an inefficient use of link bandwidth thatcould also result in degraded service. This document describes amechanism to do it without such problems.</t>
