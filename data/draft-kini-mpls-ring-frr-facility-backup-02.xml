    <abstract>
      <t>Fast Re-route (FRR) using facility backup is a widely deployed MPLS protection mechanism that can protect against link and node failure. It provides a fast protection switch mechanism to minimize traffic loss (typically sub 50msec) if the node that detects the failure locally, does the repair by re-routing the protected traffic to go over the backup tunnel. A direct application of this mechanism to a ring topology results in an inefficient use of link bandwidth that could also result in degraded service. This document describes a mechanism to do it without such problems.</t>
