      <t>Exchange of routing information between IPsec security gateways, using standard routing protocols across IPsec tunnels, can be a straightforward operation. Using the routing information to choose the proper path is also straightforward, when routing is functionally separated from the IPsec gateway operation. One of the most significant obstacles to widespread implementation of dynamic routing in IPsec VPNs has been agreement on a way to exchange and use the routing information. This document describes a simple and secure method of exchanging dynamic routing information between IPsec security gateways, using standard IPsec messages. This method is currently in use in a large number of installations, and has been demonstrated to be interoperable across several IPsec implementations from different vendors.</t>
