      <t>Many services that SIP is anticipated to support require the ability to determine why and how the call arrived at a specific application. Examples of such services include (but are not limited to) sessions initiated to call centers via 'click to talk' SIP URLs on a web page, 'call history/logging' style services within intelligent 'call management' software for SIP UAs and calls to voicemail servers and call centers. While SIP implicitly provides the redirect/retarget capabilities that enable calls to be routed to chosen applications, there is currently no standard mechanism within SIP for communicating the history of such a request. This 'request history' information allows the receiving application to determine hints about how and why the call arrived at the application/user. This draft discusses the motivations in support of a mechanism for recording the 'request history', and proposes detailed requirements for such a generic 'request history' capability.</t>
