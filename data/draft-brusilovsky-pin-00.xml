      <t>The purpose of this Internet Draft is to start discussion on the issues involved in PSTN Internet Notification (PIN), as part of interconnecting IP and Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) with the intent of converging existing and creating new hybrid PSTN and IP services. PSTN Events Notification, based on open well-defined protocols, will promote interoperability of both the networks and systems built by different vendors. This Internet Draft is submitted with the goal of becoming an informational RFC. The rest of this document is as follows: Section 2 briefly describes the PIN services. Section 3 describes the scope of the proposed project by introducing its overall architecture and identifying the interfaces to be standardized. Sections 4, 5, and 6 respectively address security considerations, supply references, and provide the authors address, as required by [1]. Section 7 acknowledges individuals providing assistance in the creation of this document.</t>
