      <t>The current DS-TE requirements document [DSTEREQ] focuses on solutions that enable carrying a single Class of Service on an LSP. This document extends the work in [DSTEREQ] by motivating the need to support a DS-TE solution that enables multiple COS on an E-LSP. The document further defines the requirements for such an approach. The requirements are developed such that this approach would be an optional extension to the existing DS-TE.</t>
