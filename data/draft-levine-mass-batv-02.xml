      <t>The envelope of Internet mail contains an RFC2821.MailFrom command,which may supply an address to be used as the recipient oftransmission and delivery notices about the original message.Existing Internet mail permits unauthorized use of addresses in theMailFrom command, causing notices to be sent to unwitting andunwilling recipients. Bounce Address Tag Validation (BATV) definesan extensible mechanism for validating the MailFrom address. It alsodefines an initial use of that mechanism which requires noadministrative overhead and no global implementation.</t>
