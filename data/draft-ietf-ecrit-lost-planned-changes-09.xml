      <t>This document defines an extension to the Location to Service Translation (LoST) protocol (RFC5222) that allows a LoST server to notify a client of planned changes to the data it receives. This extension is only useful for the validation function of LoST. It is beneficial for LoST validation clients to be aware of planned changes, as records that previously were valid may become invalid as of a known future date, and new records may become valid after some future date. This extension adds an element to the &lt;findService&gt; request: namely, a date that allows the LoST client to request that the server perform validation as of the date specified. It adds an optional Time-To-Live element to the response, which informs clients of the current expected lifetime of a validation. It also adds a separate interface to the LoST server that allows a client to poll for planned changes. Additionally, this document provides a conventional XML schema for LoST, as a backwards compatible alternative to the RelaxNG schema in RFC5222.</t>
