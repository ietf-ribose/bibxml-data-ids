      <t>A range of Management Information Base (MIB) modules has been developed to help model and manage the various aspects of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks. These MIB modules are defined in separate documents that focus on the specific areas of responsibility of the modules that they describe. The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of MPLS functionality specific to the construction of packet-switched transport networks. This document describes the MIB-based architecture for MPLS-TP, and indicates the interrelationships between different existing MIB modules that can be leveraged for MPLS-TP network management and identifies areas where additional MIB modules are required.</t>
