      <t>This document provides a means to identify component links that are bundled within an unnumbered interface. This feature is required during Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) establishment of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) that utilize such component links. Similarly, it is useful in error reporting for such LSPs.</t>
