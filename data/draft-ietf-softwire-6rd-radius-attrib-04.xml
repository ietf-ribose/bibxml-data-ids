      <t>IPv6 Rapid Deployment (6rd) is one of the most popular methods to provide both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-existing period. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) 6rd option has been defined to configure 6rd Customer Edge (CE). However, in many networks, the configuration information may be stored in Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) servers while user configuration is mainly from Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) through DHC protocol. This document defines a Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) attribute that carries 6rd configuration information from AAA server to BNG.</t>
