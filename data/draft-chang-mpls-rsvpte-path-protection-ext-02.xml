      <t>To deliver reliable service, multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) requires a set of procedures to enable -protection of the traffic carried on - label switched paths (LSPs). Thus existing signaling mechanisms must be extended appropriately to support such functionality. Recently, RSVP-TE [1] has introduced extensions to RSVP to support the establishment of LSP tunnels. This draft extends RSVP-TE to support path protection [2] in MPLS. Specifically, we provide signaling support for establishing backup LSPs and for propagating fault notification upon LSP failure.</t>
