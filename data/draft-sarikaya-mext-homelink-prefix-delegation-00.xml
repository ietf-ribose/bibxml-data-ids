      <t>In Mobile IPv6 home link operation on point-to-point links requiresthat one prefix can only be assigned to one mobile node by the homeagent (HA) and different mobile nodes can not share this home networkprefix. Managing Per-MN home network prefixes is likely to increasethe processing load at the HA. Based on the idea that DHCPv6 serverscan manage prefixes, we propose a new technique in which HA offloadsdelegation and release tasks of the prefixes to the DHCPv6 server.HA requests a prefix for an incoming mobile station to the DHCPv6server. Based on this prefix, the mobile node can create a homeaddress. When the mobile node leaves the network, the prefix isreturned to the DHCPv6 server.</t>
