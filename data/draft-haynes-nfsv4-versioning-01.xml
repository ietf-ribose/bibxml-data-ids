      <t>This document describes the management of versioning within the NFSv4 family of protocols. It covers the creation of minor versions, the addition of OPTIONAL features to existing minor versions, and the correction of flaws in features already published as Proposed Standards. The rules for minor versioning set out in this document supersede the multiple sets of minor versioning rules in RFC3530 and RFC5661.</t>
