      <t>This document specifies an OSPF Router Information (RI) TLV to advertise the current Geo Coordinates of the OSPF router. For Point- to-Point (P2P)) and Point-to-Multi-Point (P2MP) networks, the Geo Coordinates can be used to dynamically computing the cost to neighbors. This is useful both from the standpoint of auto- configuration and situations where the OSPF routers are moving. The Geo Coordinates are also useful for other applications such as Traffic Engineering (TE) and network management.</t>
