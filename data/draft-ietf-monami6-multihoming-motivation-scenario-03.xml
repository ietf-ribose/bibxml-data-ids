      <t>In this document, multihoming is investigated from an end-node point of view, and not from a site point of view as the term "multihoming" is commonly understood so far. The purpose of this document is to explain the motivations for fixed and mobile nodes (hosts and routers) using multiple interfaces and the scenarios where this may end up using multiple global addresses on their interfaces. Such multihoming configurations can bring a number of benefits once appropriate support mechanisms are put in place. Interestingly, this analysis is generic, i.e. motivations and benefits of node multihoming apply to both fixed end nodes and mobile end nodes.</t>
