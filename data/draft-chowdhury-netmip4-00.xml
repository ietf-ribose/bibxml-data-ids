      <t>The layer 3 mobility management in a mobile wireless network can be performed with Mobile IPv4. The solution however requires the mobile nodes to have Mobile IPv4 clients. There may be scenarios where the mobile devices do not have Mobile IPv4 clients. The layer 3 mobility for these devices (often called simple IPv4 mobiles) can be done if the network has a Mobile IPv4 client function that can perform Mobile IPv4 procedures on behalf of the mobile nodes. This document defines such a mechanism.</t>
