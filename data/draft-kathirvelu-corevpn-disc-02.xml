      <t>An IPVPN consists of many routers, some physically discrete and some virtual, housed in a Provider Edge router. The problem that presents itself is that these virtual routers need to find each other over a virtual topology and they need to send broadcast datagrams as mandated in routing protocols [such as the neighbor discovery datagram and routing updates in OSPF, the routing updates in RIPV2 etc] and user data over this virtual topology. This memo presents an approach for solving these problems</t>
