      <t>An IPVPN consists of many routers, some physically discrete andsome virtual, housed in a Provider Edge router. The problem thatpresents itself is that these virtual routers need to find eachother over a virtual topology and they need to send broadcastdatagrams as mandated in routing protocols [such as the neighbordiscovery datagram and routing updates in OSPF, the routingupdates in RIPV2 etc] and user data over this virtual topology.This memo presents an approach for solving these problems</t>
