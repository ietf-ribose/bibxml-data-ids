    <abstract>
      <t>Based on the analysis of current centralized mobility management approaches, three main functions of current centralized mobility anchor are introduced, which are Mobility Routing (MR), Home Address Allocation (HAA), and Location Management (LM). Based on the proposal of decoupling those functions, this document provides a concept of architecture for Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) with some key approaches for DMM.</t>
