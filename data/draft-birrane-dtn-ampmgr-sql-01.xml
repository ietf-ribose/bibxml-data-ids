    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a proposed public interface through which an application, such as a network management console, interacts with an Asynchronous Management Protocol (AMP) Manager via a database supporting the Structured Query Language (SQL). The use of SQL as an interfacing layer provides a natural way to describe interactions with an AMP Manager independent of a particular implementation of either the Manager or the application. Specifically, this document presents a database schema capturing how to send controls to a Manager and how to accept reports received by a Manager from one or more AMP Agents.</t>
