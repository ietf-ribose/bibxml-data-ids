    <abstract>
      <t>This document extends RFC 4291 for IPv6 over modern Non-Broadcast / Non-Transitive networks that decouples the IP concepts of Interface, Link and Subnet from the physical concepts of interface, link and broadcast domain, to apply on networks where relying on broadcast is undesirable. A study of the issues with ND-Classic over wireless media is presented, and a framework to solve those issues within the new architecture is proposed.</t>
