      <t>Current CCAMP works focus on intra-domain control plane. This document focuses on inter-domain control plane. It views the overall network as a collection of administrative domains, partitioned by operators according to administrative, technological or geographical considerations. This document specifies a BGP/GMPLS based inter-domain solution for setting up circuit LSPs(Label Switched Paths) that span multiple administrative domains. A few extensions and modifications are proposed to BGP in order to disseminate appropriate topology information and calculate end-to-end circuit paths. GMPLS signaling is also extended for the inter-domain connection operations. The solution specified in this draft is fundermental for inter-domain operations and can be used as a base for various applications, e.g. OVPN. It is also very flexible and scalable.</t>
