      <t>The TURN protocol is designed to solve the connectivity problem of Peer-to-Peer Communication when NAT devices exist, by allowing each peer to establish a data channel on TURN servers. Since there are some specific requirements in the use of TURN, such as RTP/RTCP connection pairs must be sent to the same TURN server, it is not easy to scale a single TURN server into a TURN cluster. In addition, a TURN service cluster also needs to consider how to achieve good load balancing and how to protect internal information security. Based on these demands, this specification provides several standard means to implement a functional and secure TURN cluster, and this specification also provides an overview and rationale of the cluster architecture.</t>
