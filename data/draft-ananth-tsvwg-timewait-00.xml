      <t>Source port randomization has been suggested to provide improvedsecurity and obfuscation which helps in adding robustness towardsblind attacks. With TCP in practice, simply producing a random portas the source port for a new connection can lead to problems when aTCP client establishes connections to a TCP server at a high rate.If the same source port value is chosen twice, the client TCPconnection can fail due to the server having the Transmission ControlBlock (TCB) for this tuple lingering in TIME-WAIT state.This memo discusses the ramifications of such source port reusescenarios and suggests some mitigations to avoid the same.</t>
