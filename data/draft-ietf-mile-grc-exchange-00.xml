      <t>Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) programs provide oversight (governance) of risks and compliance initiatives within an organization. GRC reports are increasingly provided in an XML format. This specification defines a common method to securely transport GRC and other XML reports. The defined messaging capability provides policy options and markings in an XML schema, options for confidentiality at the document/report level, and security for the end-to-end communication. XML reports may be shared between service providers and clients, enterprises, or within enterprises.
