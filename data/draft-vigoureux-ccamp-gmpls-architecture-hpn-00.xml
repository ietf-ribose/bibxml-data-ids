      <t>Optical networks could have been reduced to point-to-point links but technology evolution led the way to an evolution trend. The concept of optical transparency first took shape through the development of photonic switching fabrics and is now being reinforced by the continuous efforts produced to increase transmission distances. Optical networking obviously can not be left aside of such evolutions and so it is for the (in particular, GMPLS-based) protocols that control these photonic networks. This document highlights the enhancements that seem to be necessary for GMPLS to cover these emerging trends (transparency, hybrid nodes) and fulfil its role of a generalized control plane.</t>
