      <t>Optical networks could have been reduced to point-to-point links buttechnology evolution led the way to an evolution trend. The conceptof optical transparency first took shape through the development ofphotonic switching fabrics and is now being reinforced by thecontinuous efforts produced to increase transmission distances.Optical networking obviously can not be left aside of suchevolutions and so it is for the (in particular, GMPLS-based)protocols that control these photonic networks. This documenthighlights the enhancements that seem to be necessary for GMPLS tocover these emerging trends (transparency, hybrid nodes) and fulfilits role of a generalized control plane.</t>
