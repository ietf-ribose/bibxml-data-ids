      <t>This document contains an informal description of the ATM network architecutre, mechanical translation of IP to ATM layer address, and the usage of the address in the ATM call control protocol. It briefly describes the network architecture, namely the subnet and peer model, an ATM network needs to support; discusses concerns about interconnecting these two models, and presents our solution in the context of ATM call control protocol. The mechanism proposed here, although presented in the context of IP network, can be applied to other type of networks, such as X.25, Frame Relay, SMDS etc.</t>
