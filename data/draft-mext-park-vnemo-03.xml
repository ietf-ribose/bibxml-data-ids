      <t>A mobile network can be multihomed as described in [RFC4980]. This document describes the experimental result of service differentiation using multihoming with multiple prefixes. The multiple prefixes in IPv6 NEMO implements multiple virtual mobile networks on a single physical NEMO. The multiple virtual mobile networks provide service differentiation on a single mobile network. Each mobile network node inside the mobile network prioritizes for service differenciation. It can be differenciated among the virutal mobile networks or forwarding traffic from each virtual mobile network to different access networks. In this experiment, a mobile router with multiple interfaces can make connection to several access networks simultaneoulsly.</t>
