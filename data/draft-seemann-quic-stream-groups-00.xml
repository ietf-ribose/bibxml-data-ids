    <abstract>
      <t>QUIC ([RFC9000]) defines a few different mechanism flow control mechanisms: Stream flow control, connection-level flow control and flow control for the number of (unidirectional / bidirectional) streams This allows a single application running on of a QUIC connection to apply backpressure. However, when multiple independent applications share a single underlying QUIC connection, these mechanisms are not sufficient to prevent one resource-hungry application from consuming all the resources (streams and / or connection-level flow control credit) available on the connection, effectively starving the other application.</t>
