      <t>This document provides GMPLS OSPF routing enhancements to supportsignal compatibility constraints associated with WSON networkelements. These routing enhancements are required in common opticalor hybrid electro-optical networks where not all of the opticalsignals in the network are compatible with all network elementsparticipating in the network.This compatibility constraint model is applicable to common opticalor hybrid electro optical systems such as OEO switches, regenerators,and wavelength converters since such systems can be limited toprocessing only certain types of WSON signals.Conventions used in this documentThe key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].</t>
