    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides methods and settings for using IPv6 to communicate among nodes within range of one another over 5G V2X (i.e., the 5th generation vehicle-to-everything) links. Support for these methods and settings require minimal changes to existing stacks. This document also describes limitations associated with using these methods. Optimizations and usage of IPv6 over more complex scenarios are not covered in this specification and are a subject for future work.</t>
