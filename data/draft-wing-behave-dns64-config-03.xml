      <t>Some networks are expected to support IPv4-only, dual-stack, andIPv6-only hosts at the same time. Such networks also want to IPv6/IPv4 translation for the IPv6-only host so it can access servers onthe IPv4 Internet. On such a network, the synthesized AAAA responsesfrom a DNS64 can cause traffic to be translated. This documentdescribes a solution to avoid that translation when the applicationuses DNS.</t>
