    <abstract>
      <t>According to the base BGP specification, a BGP speaker that receives an UPDATE message containing a malformed attribute is required to reset the session over which the offending attribute was received. RFC7606 revises the error handling procedures for a number of existing attributes. The use of the "treat-as-withdraw" and "attribute discard" approaches significantly reduces the likelihood of BGP sessions being reset when receiving malformed BGP update messages, thereby greatly enhancing network stability. However, in practical applications, there are still numerous instances where BGP session oscillations occur due to the receipt of malformed BGP update messages, unrecognized attribute fields, or routing rules generated by a certain BGP AFI/SAFI that affect the forwarding of BGP messages. This document introduces some approaches to enhance the stability of BGP sessions.</t>
