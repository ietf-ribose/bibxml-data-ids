      <t>Frequently a router may have multiple sources of information about paths through the network. For example, a router may be simultaneously learning routes from multiple routing domains, and may have static routes configured by the network manager. This paper resents a proposal for control of interactions between multiple routing protocols, including choice of routes when multiple IP routing protocols are being used simultaneously, as well as exchange of routes between routing protocols.</t>
