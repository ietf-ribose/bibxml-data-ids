      <t>The IETF has provided some tools for remote participation in its activities for many years, and some IETF participants have also used their own tools when they felt the need arise. The IETF now wishes to support enhanced remote participation that is as seamless as possible, improving the experience for the remote attendee without degrading the experience for the people that are physically present. Before deploying the new tools and services needed for this enhanced remote participation, the requirements for such tools and services, and the impacts they will make on the current procedures and infrastructure, must be defined. This document is meant to be that definition.</t>
