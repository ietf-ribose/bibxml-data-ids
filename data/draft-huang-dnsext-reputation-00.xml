      <t>This document defines the format of a new Resource Record (RR) for the Domain Naming System (DNS), (and reserves a corresponding DNS type mnemonic: DRIC and numerical code - to be done) This definition deals with associating a reputation measure to a domain, a host name, or a url before domain name resolution. It also deals with associating a classification of the result ip# after domain name resolution. The data shown in this document is fictitious and does not necessarily reflect the real Internet.</t>
