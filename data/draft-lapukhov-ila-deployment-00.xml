      <t>Identifier-Locator Addressing defined in [I-D.herbert-nvo3-ila] proposes using locator-identifier split in IPv6 address to realize workload mobility and network virtualization. This document describes how ILA can be implemented in datacenter using BGP as the control-plane protocol. In general, ILA could be built upon different control planes, and BGP is one particular instantiation. BGP is a well-known protocol, sufficient for small to medium size deployments, on scale of few millions of mappings. Defining more generic and scalable control plane is outside of scope of this document.</t>
