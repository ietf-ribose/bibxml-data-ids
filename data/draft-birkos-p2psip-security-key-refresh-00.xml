      <t>This document proposes security extensions that are applicable toP2PSIP overlays that follow the base protocol described in the WGleading drafts. The proposed extensions exploit symmetric/asymmetriccryptography and a key refresh mechanism to protect the signalingexchanged between the participating peers in order to enhance therobustness of the system against several types of attacks that arecommon to peer-to-peer networks. The refresh mechanism is eithersupervised by higher-level trusted peers or exclusively controlled bythe members of the overlay.</t>
