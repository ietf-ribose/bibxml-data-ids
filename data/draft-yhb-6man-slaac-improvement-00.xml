      <t>IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration described by RFC4862 only supports 64-bit prefixes. This approach can't be deployed in the sites with prefixes longer than 64. We have no right to require that the sites MUST use 64-bit prefixes. This document tries to implement stateless address autoconfiguration with prefixes longer than 64.</t>
