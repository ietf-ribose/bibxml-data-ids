    <abstract>
      <t>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths by encoding paths as sequences of sub-paths, called "segments". Segment routing architecture can be implemented over an MPLS data plane as well as an IPv6 data plane. Further, Path Segment has been defined in order to identify an SR path in SR-MPLS networks, and used for various use-cases such as end- to-end SR Path Protection and Performance Measurement (PM) of an SR path. Similar to SR-MPLS, this document defines the Path Segment in SRv6 networks in order to identify an SRv6 path.</t>
