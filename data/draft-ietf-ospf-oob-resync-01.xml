      <t>OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IPnetworks. LSDB synchronization in OSPF is achieved via two methods--initial LSDB synchronization when an OSPF router has just beenconnected to the network and asynchronous flooding that ensurescontinuous LSDB synchronization in the presence of topology changesafter the initial procedure was completed. It may sometime benecessary for OSPF routers to resynchronize their LSDBs. OSPFstandard, however, does not allow routers to do so without actuallychanging the topology view of the network. This memo describes amechanism to perform such form of out-of-band LSDB synchronization.</t>
