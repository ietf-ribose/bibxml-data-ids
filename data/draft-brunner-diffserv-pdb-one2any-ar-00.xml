      <t>This document defines a Per-Domain Behavior (PDB) called one-to-any Assured Rate. The PDB is useful to implement services in a Differentiate Services domain, which need an assured rate. The assurance is given with a certain well-defined probability for traffic using this PDB. However, no delay and no jitter guarantees are provided.</t>
