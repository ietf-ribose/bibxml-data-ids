      <t>DMARC allows for domain holders to request aggregate reports from receivers. This report is an XML document, and contains extensible elements that allow for other types of data to be specified later. The aggregate reports can be submitted to the domain holder's specified destination as supported by the receiver. This document (along with others) obsoletes RFC7489.</t>
