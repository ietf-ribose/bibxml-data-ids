    <abstract>
      <t>SIP over connection-oriented transport protocol based systems are likely to face certain distinct performance and behavioral issues that are not manifest when SIP is transported over connectionless protocols. Allowing SIP entities to mutually conserve connections over a predictable, extended period of time is one of the leading requirements to help SIP entities deliver their optimal performance in the network. Overall, this document contemplates transport layer connection management issues relating to SIP. Requirements and potential solutions for introducing a backward compatible notion of persistent connections in SIP are presented.</t>
