      <t>Issuers of Digital Credentials enable dynamic state or status checks through the use of dereferenceable identifiers, that resolve to resources providing herd privacy. Privacy in such systems is determined not just from the size of the herd, and the cryptographic structure encoding it, but also from the observability of access to shared state. This document describes a privacy preserving state management system for digital credentials based on Oblivious HTTP that addresses both data model and protocol risks associated with digital credentials with dynamic state.</t>
