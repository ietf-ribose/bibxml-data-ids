      <t>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) is today widely used in theInternet to announce as well as negotiate multimedia sessions andexchange capabilities. Having originally been designed for sessionannouncements only, as opposed to announcements and capabilitiesnegotiation announcements, native SDP lacks numerous features to beapplicable in many session scenarios. Numerous extensions have beendeveloped to circumvent SDP's shortcomings -- but they have alsorepeatedly shown its inherent limitations. A successor protocol --termed 'SDPng' for the time being -- is developed to address theaforementioned needs of Internet applications in a more structuredmanner. With the huge installed base of SDP-based applications, amigration path needs to be developed to move from SDP to SDPng overtime. This document outlines how this migration can be achieved: ingeneral as well as for the various IETF control protocols thatpotentially make use of SDP and SDPng.</t>
