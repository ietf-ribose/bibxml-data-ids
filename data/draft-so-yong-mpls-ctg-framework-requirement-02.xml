      <t>This document states a traffic distribution problem in today's IP/MPLS network when multiple links are configured between two routers. The document presents motivation, a framework and requirements. It defines a composite link as a group of parallel links that can be considered as a single traffic engineering link or as an IP link, and used for MPLS. The document primarily focuses on MPLS traffic controlled through control plane protocols, the advertisement of composite link parameter in routing protocols, and the use of composite links in the RSVP-TE and LDP signaling protocols. Interactions with the data and management plane are also addressed. Applicability can be between a single pair of MPLS- capable nodes, a sequence of MPLS-capable nodes, or a multi-layer network connecting MPLS-capable nodes.</t>
