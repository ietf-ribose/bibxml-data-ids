      <t>The word 'hypertext' was coined by Theodor Holm Nelson in his paper 'A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing and the Indeterminate', presented at the ACM 20th national conference in 1965. One of the key concepts in Nelson's vision of hypertext is 'transclusion' or virtual inclusion, which permits composite documents to be constructed by reference to the original components rather than by copying. The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language used to create hypertext documents that are platform independent. HTML currently permits the transclusion of various content types using tags which accept a 'SRC' attribute, such as the IMG, EMBED and APPLET tags, but does not provide a mechanism for transcluding textual content. This document proposes markup for text transclusions in HTML and explains its usage.</t>
