      <t>This draft presents a framework document for modeling network elements (NE), facilities, lines, protocols and services for substantially easing development and operation of element manager systems (EMS), network management systems (NMS) and operations support systems (OSS). The framework is independent of the access method used, including SNMP, CLI, Netconf, Corba, CMIP, XML-RPC, etc.) It covers configuration, alarms, current-historical performance, accounting management and security. The frameworks builds on and reuses the existing base of MIBs. The documents presents a light-weight, structured and very simplified framework and method to data modeling for defining and maintaining meta models, device etc. models, and device etc. descriptors.</t>
