      <t>This draft describes the concept of the Shared Link Risk Group (SRLG) based logical ring configuration and recovery method using ring SRLG for the purpose of PCE-based backup path computation. In this restoration architecture, backup paths can be easily established through the end-to-end path which follows from the logical ring configuration. It guarantees the establishment of backup path disjoint from the working path at all levels. To take advantage of bandwidth considerations and fast restoration mechanisms, a centralized Controller is used to provide dedicated protection to Optical Transport Networks using the SRLG concept.</t>
