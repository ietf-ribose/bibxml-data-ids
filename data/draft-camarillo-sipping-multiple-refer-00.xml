      <t>This document defines extensions to the SIP REFER method so that this method can be used to refer to multiple resources. These extensions include the use of pointers to URI-lists in the Refer-To header field, the use of bodies to describe the requests to be sent by the server, and the use of a new event package to report the state of several transactions.</t>
