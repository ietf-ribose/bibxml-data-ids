      <t>A number of Internet application protocols have a need to provide content negotiation for the resources with which they interact. While MIME media types [1] provide a standard method for handling one major axis of variation, resources also vary in ways which cannot be expressed using currently available MIME headers. This paper asserts that a cross-protocol negotiation framework is needed, both to leverage work already done for specific protocols and to allow for content negotiation when resources will pass through several protocols on their way from provider to recipient. To justify the need, this paper puts forward several content negotiation scenarios and discusses how they affect the requirements for such a framework.</t>
