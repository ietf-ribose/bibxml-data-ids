      <t>A number of Internet application protocols have a need to providecontent negotiation for the resources with which they interact. WhileMIME media types [1] provide a standard method for handling onemajor axis of variation, resources also vary in ways which cannot beexpressed using currently available MIME headers. This paper assertsthat a cross-protocol negotiation framework is needed, both toleverage work already done for specific protocols and to allow forcontent negotiation when resources will pass through severalprotocols on their way from provider to recipient. To justify theneed, this paper puts forward several content negotiation scenariosand discusses how they affect the requirements for such a framework.</t>
