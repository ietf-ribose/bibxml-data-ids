      <t>This document is intended to facilitate the use of the ISO/CCITT Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) for integrated management of networks via proxy management of TCP/IP networks that are managed using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). This document describes an ISO/CCITT to Internet 'proxy' which allows interworking between CMIP-based managers and SNMP-based agents. The proxy emulates CMIS service requests by mapping between corresponding ISO/CCITT GDMO and Internet MIB definitions, and generating SNMP message(s) needed to emulate the service. The proxy also emulates CMIS service responses and notifications by converting incoming SNMP response and trap message(s) in a similar fashion. Thus, the proxy appears as a CMIP-based agent to the manager, and as an SNMP-based manager to the agent. The proxy depends on the availability of corresponding MIB definitions translated as described in [IIMCIMIBTRANS].</t>
