      <t>Real-time media streams are not resilient against packet losses. RTP[1] provides all the necessary mechanisms to restore ordering andtiming to properly reproduce a media stream at the recipient. RTPalso provides continuous feedback about the overall reception qualityfrom all receivers -- thereby allowing the sender(s) in the mid-term(in the order of several seconds to minutes) to adapt their codingscheme and transmission behavior to the observed network QoS.However, except for a few payload specific mechanisms [2], RTP makesno provision for timely feedback that would allow a sender to repairthe media stream immediately: through retransmissions, retro-activeFEC, or media-specific mechanisms such as reference pictureselection.</t>
