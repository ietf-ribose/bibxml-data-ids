    <abstract>
      <t>Real-time media streams are not resilient against packet losses. RTP [1] provides all the necessary mechanisms to restore ordering and timing to properly reproduce a media stream at the recipient. RTP also provides continuous feedback about the overall reception quality from all receivers -- thereby allowing the sender(s) in the mid-term (in the order of several seconds to minutes) to adapt their coding scheme and transmission behavior to the observed network QoS. However, except for a few payload specific mechanisms [2], RTP makes no provision for timely feedback that would allow a sender to repair the media stream immediately: through retransmissions, retro-active FEC, or media-specific mechanisms such as reference picture selection.</t>
