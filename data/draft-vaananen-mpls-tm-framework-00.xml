      <t>It has been recognised that the success of the MPLS depends on theability to better support the multiservice traffic integration withsome levels of service guarantees, which are not feasible to implementwith the current destination prefix only based packet forwardingparadigms. The efficient support for these services throughout the network isexpected to be possible using label based forwarding paradigm in thenetwork. However, the service categories and the enabling mechanisms to supportthose service categories are not well addressed in the currentproposals for the MPLS working group; the effort has mostlyconcentrated on the handling of the best effort traffic and associatedscalability and routing related issues. The goal of this document is to define a framework for trafficmanagement in MPLS networks. We discuss the set of mechanisms that havebeen proposed for enabling the implementation of the more advancedservices than pure best-effort packet forwarding, and the impact ofthose mechanisms with respect to MPLS network environments and MPLSprotocol implementation.The document describes the mechanisms and their application with theintent to approach the level of the traffic management capabilitiesthat are currently available in hybrid router/ATM or frame relaynetworks using the MPLS. The approach taken is that no modificationsare required in the end station protocol or application software in thefirst phase of deployment, while this might be allowed later, if deemednecessary. This document concentrates on the issues from the public networkoperators point of view, although most of the discussion applies aswell in the local network environments. Concepts and mechanisms described in this document are based on theprevious work done in the subject on various working groups of IETF andother standardisation bodies. It has been attempted to use applicableconcepts and terminology from previous work as</t>
