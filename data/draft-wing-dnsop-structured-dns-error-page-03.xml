    <abstract>
      <t>DNS filtering is widely deployed for network security, but filtered DNS responses lack information for the end user to understand the reason for the filtering. Existing mechanisms to provide detail to end users cause harm especially if the blocked DNS response is to an HTTPS website. This document updates RFC8914's EXTRA-TEXT field to provide information on DNS filtering. This information can be parsed by the client and displayed, logged, or used for other purposes.</t>
