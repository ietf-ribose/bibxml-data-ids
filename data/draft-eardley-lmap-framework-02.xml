    <abstract>
      <t>Measuring broadband service on a large scale requires standardisation of the logical architecture and a description of the key protocols that coordinate interactions between the components. The document presents an overall framework for large-scale measurements and discusses which elements could be standardised in the IETF. It is intended to assist the discussions about the potential creation of the LMAP working group.</t>
