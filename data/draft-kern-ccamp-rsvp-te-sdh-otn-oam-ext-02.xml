    <abstract>
      <t>GMPLS has been extended to support connection establishment in both SONET/SDH [RFC4606] and OTN [RFC4328] networks. However support for the configuration of the supervision functions is not specified. Both SONET/SDH and OTN implement supervision functions to qualify the transported signals. This document defines extensions to RSVP-TE for SONET/SDH and OTN OAM configuration based on the OAM Configuration Framework defined in [GMPLS-OAM-FWK].Requirements Language The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</t>
