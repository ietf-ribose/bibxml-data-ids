      <t>This document defines a set of cipher suites to add client credential protection to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol. By negotiating one of those ciphersuites, the TLS clients will be able to determine for themselves when, how, to what extent and for what purpose information about them is communicated to others. The ciphersuites defined in this document can be used only when public key certificates are used in the client authentication process.</t>
