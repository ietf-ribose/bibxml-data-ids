      <t>This document specifies an update to the Stateless IP/ICMPTranslation Algorithm (SIIT) described in RFC 2765. The algorithmtranslates between IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers (including ICMPheaders).This specification addresses both a stateless and a stateful mode.In the stateless mode, translation information is carried in theaddress itself, permitting both IPv4-&gt;IPv6 and IPv6-&gt;IPv4 sessionestablishment with neither state nor configuration in the IP/ICMPtranslator. In the stateful mode, translation state is maintainedbetween IPv4 address/transport_port tuples and IPv6 address/transport_port tuples, enabling IPv6 systems to open sessions withIPv4 systems. The choice of operational mode is made by the operatordeploying the network and is critical to the operation of theapplications using it.Significant issues exist in the stateless and stateful modes that arenot addressed in this document, related to the address assignment andthe maintenance of the translation tables, respectively. Thisdocument confines itself to the actual translation.Acknowledgement of previous workThis document is a product of the 2008-2009 effort to define areplacement for NAT-PT. It is an update to and directly derivativefrom Erik Nordmark's [RFC2765], which similarly provides bothstateless and stateful translation between IPv4 [RFC0791] and IPv6[RFC2460], and between ICMPv4 [RFC0792] and ICMPv6 [RFC4443]. Theoriginal document was a product of the NGTRANS working group.The changes in this document reflect five components:1. Redescribing the network model to map to present and projected usage.2. Moving the address format to the framework document, to coordinate with other drafts on the topic.3. Description of both stateful and stateless operation.4. Some changes in ICMP.5. Updating references.RequirementsThe keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in thisdocument, are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</t>
