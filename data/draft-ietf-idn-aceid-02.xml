    <abstract>
      <t>In IETF IDN WG, various kinds of ASCII Compatible Encodings, hereafter abbreviated as 'ACE', are discussed as methods for realizing multilingual domain names (hereafter referred to as 'MDN'). Each ACE uses a prefix or a suffix as an identifier in order for MDNs to fit within the existing ASCII domain name space. In other words, acceptance of an ACE proposal as an Internet standard means that the existing ASCII domain name space will be partitioned, in order to accommodate MDN space. This document describes possible trouble in the standardization process of ACE, and proposes a solution for it.</t>
