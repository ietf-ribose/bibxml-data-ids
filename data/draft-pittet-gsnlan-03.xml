      <t>This document further specifies a method for resolving IP addresses to HIPPI-6400 (High-Performance Parallel Interface) hardware addresses (HARP) and for emulating IP broadcast in a logical IP subnet (LIS) as a direct extension of HARP. Furthermore, it is the goal of this memo to define a IP and HARP that will allow interoperability for HIPPI-800 and HIPPI-6400 equipment both broadcast and non-broadcast capable networks.
