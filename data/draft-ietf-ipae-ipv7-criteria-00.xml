      <t>This document describes how the IPv7 proposal called IP Address Encapsulation (IPAE) meets the evaluation criteria established by the Internet Engineering Steering Group and described in 'RFC-1380 IESG Deliberations on Routing and Addressing'. IPAE is currently developed to be a transition mechanism for a new IP protocol. This document focuses on the specific case of using IPAE to transition to the Simple IP Protocol (SIP). It addresses the criteria against both IPAE and SIP. This document also includes how IPAE meets the criteria described by Craig Partridge in a message titled 'Criteria for selecting IPv7' sent to the Big-Internet mailing list on 22-October-1992.</t>
