      <t>NTP packets can be authenticated by a Message Authentication Code (MAC) if a MAC is present at the end of an NTP packet. The legacy format for this MAC is not formatted as an NTP Extension Field, and its presence may cause some implementations a parsing ambiguity. This proposal introduces two ways to resolve this problem. One is to provide a MAC Extension Field. The other is an extension field that unambiguously declares itself to be the last extension field in an NTP packet (so any additional data MUST be a legacy MAC).
