      <t>In this paper we discuss various security issues concerning MobileHosts using Mobile-IP or other mobility systems (DHCP standalone)and current firewall technology. We first present some recentattacks on the Internet and what they might mean for mobile systemslike Mobile-IP that rely on tunneling technologies. We point outthat tunnels are a security threat and suggest how mobile systemsmay be made 'less insecure' with the use of IP layer security(IPSEC) as one means for creating Virtual Private Networks. Thegoal is to describe a security model wherein mobile systems canwork across the Internet and not just as an interior routing protocolwithin one security and/or interior routing domain. Both theprotection of Mobile Systems abroad and of Security Enclaves thattolerate mobile visitors must be considered.</t>
