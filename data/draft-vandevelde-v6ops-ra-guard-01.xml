      <t>When using IPv6 within a single L2 network segment it is neccesary to ensure that all routers advertising their services within it are valid. In cases where it is not convinient or possible to use SeND [1] a rogue Router Advertisement (RA) [2] could be sent by accident due to misconfiguraton or ill intended. Simple solutions for protecting against rogue RAs are beneficial in complementing SeND in securing the L2 domain for ceratin types of devices or in certain transitional situations. This document proposes a solution to reduce the threat of rogue RAs by enabling layer 2 devices to forward only RAs received over designated ports.</t>
