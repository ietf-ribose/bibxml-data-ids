      <t>Exposing additional topology information of networks to applications and users beyond that of the current ALTO protocol can enable many important existing and emerging use cases, and many network providers already provide additional information about their networks. At the same time, there is no standard for exposing network topology in a manner that provides simplification via abstraction to the application layer and information hiding via abstraction to the network provider. In this document, we provide a survey of use-cases for extended network topology information, present some initial requirements for such services, and then give a framework of how to integrate such an extended ALTO topology service with network control infrastructure.</t>
