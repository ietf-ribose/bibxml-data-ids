      <t>This memo defines a modular metric calculation system termed ScoredFair Metric Calculation (SFMC). SFMC can be integrated with LinkState and Distance Vector routing protocols and their extensions[1,4,5,6,7], enabling them to find network paths that support thehighest possible number of best metrics across a network. SFMC makesit possible to support and mix large sets of heterogeneous networkfeatures and capabilities.SFMC solves many of the issues inherent in routing protocols thatattempt to use complex sets of metrics by decoupling raw metric datafrom the input side of routing protocols. Unlike the past, SFMCregards all metrics all the time, while treating all metrics equally(by default).Additionally, the SFMC architecture provides a simple and flexibleinterface for extensive manipulation of path selection.Please send comments to ospf@discuss.microsoft.com.</t>
