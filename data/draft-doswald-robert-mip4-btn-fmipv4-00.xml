      <t>Proposed fast handover solutions for Mobile IPv4 depend on thepresence of Foreign Agents (FA) in the networks between which theMobile Node (MN) moves to ensure their operation. However, in manysituations the MN moves into networks without FAs. This documentproposes a solution that includes fast handover mechanisms involvinga direct connection to the Home Agent (HA). This solution is not afull fledged fast handover proposal, but rather a complement to RFC4881: Low-Latency Handovers in Mobile IPv4, and RFC 4988: Mobile IPv4Fast Handover.</t>
