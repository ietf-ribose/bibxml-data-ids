      <t>The specification of the ALTO protocol uses map based approaches assuming that the information provided is static for a longer period of time. But in some cases network operators reallocate IP subnets from time to time which in turn changes the mapping partitions[I- D.ietf-alto-deployments]. Since the ALTO clients are unaware of the map information changes, clients need to query the servers for every service request and many such requests are redundant because the information was not changed. The purpose of this memo is to provide two mechanisms which will help the ALTO clients to be informed of the map information changes. a) ALTO clients cache the map information and the servers provide the expiration time for invalidation. b) ALTO clients can subscribe for event notifications from the server</t>
