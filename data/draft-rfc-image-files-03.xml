      <t>Documents in the RFC series normally use only plain-text ASCII characters and a fixed-width font. However, there is sometimes a need to supplement the ASCII text with images -- e.g., graphics, equations, or pictures. The historic solution to this requirement has allowed secondary PDF and/or Postscript files, but this approach has seldom been used because it is awkward for authors and publisher. This memo sugests a convenient scheme for logically including authoritative diagrams, illustrations, equations, or other graphics within RFCs.</t>
