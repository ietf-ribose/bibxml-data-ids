      <t>In draft-kempf-netlmm-nohost-ps, the problems with using global IP mobility management protocols for local mobility and some problems with existing localized mobility management protocols are described. In this document, we explore requirements for localized mobility management in more detail. An extensive gap analysis against the protocols illustrates where existing protocols are able to fulfill the requirements and where they are lacking.</t>
