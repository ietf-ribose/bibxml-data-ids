      <t>There are several mechanisms for distributing public keys andcertificates today. These distribution services publish certificateswhich contain cryptographic public keys. Clients that use any ofthese distribution services to retrieve certificates, requireadditional software for the retrieval, parsing and verificationof these certificates. In this draft, we propose an alternatescheme that takes advantage of the Secure DNS infrastructure todistribute verified public keys obtained from other distributionservices.</t>
