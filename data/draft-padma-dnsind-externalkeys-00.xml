    <abstract>
      <t>There are several mechanisms for distributing public keys and certificates today. These distribution services publish certificates which contain cryptographic public keys. Clients that use any of these distribution services to retrieve certificates, require additional software for the retrieval, parsing and verification of these certificates. In this draft, we propose an alternate scheme that takes advantage of the Secure DNS infrastructure to distribute verified public keys obtained from other distribution services.</t>
