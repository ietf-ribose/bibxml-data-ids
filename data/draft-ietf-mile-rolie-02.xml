    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a resource-oriented approach to cyber security information sharing. Using this approach, operators may share and exchange representations of cyber security incidents, attack indicators, software vulnerabilities, and other related information as Web-addressable resources. Furthermore, consumers and other stakeholders may access and search this security content as needed, establishing a rapid and on-demand information exchange network for restricted internal use or public access repositories. This specification builds on and extends the Atom Publishing Protocol and Atom Syndication Format to transport and share cyber security resource representations. This document leverages the existing representations IODEF and RID where appropriate, and supports related cyber security representation standards.</t>
