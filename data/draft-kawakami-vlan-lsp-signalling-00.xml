      <t>This document describes a method to set up a Layer 2 tunnel over Ethernet-based networks. For this purpose, the ports of an Ethernet switch are configured to forward VLAN tag-labeled frames incoming from a certain port to another unambiguous port by using only the VLAN tag information. The Ethernet switches form the transport plane and are a part of Label Switching Routers (LSRs). In the control plane the VLAN tags are distribute using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) and Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP- TE). To enable LDP and RSVP-TE to fulfil that function, this document proposes extensions in these protocols. The introduced method simplifies the control and management of wide area Ethernet networks and limits the distribution of broadcast/multicast frames.</t>
