      <t>The Constrained Resource Identifier (CRI) is a complement to the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that represents the URI components in Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) rather than as a sequence of characters. This approach simplifies parsing, comparison, and reference resolution in environments with severe limitations on processing power, code size, and memory size. This RFC updates RFC 7595 by adding a column on the "URI Schemes" registry as well as a note on how that registry cooperates with the "CRI Scheme Numbers for Certain Unregistered Scheme Names" registry created by the present RFC. // (This "cref" paragraph will be removed by the RFC editor:) The // present revision -26 is taking on the results from the 2025-10-09 // IESG telechat (issue #140), by integrating the CRI scheme number // column into the URI scheme registry created by RFC 7595 and // keeping the URI-Scheme registration process essentially unchanged // from the point of view of a registrant that does not have any // special requirements on the CRI scheme number assigned. Also, the // cri'' application-extension syntax has been moved to draft-ietf- // cbor-edn-literals, which is currently lagging behind in the // approval process.</t>
