    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes OSPF traffic engineering capability TLVs. Two capability TLVs are defined in the current draft: the Path Computation Server Discovery (PCSD) TLV that allows a router to announce its Path Computation Server capability to other LSRs within an OSPF area or a routing domain and the Mesh-group TLV used by an LSR to indicate its desire to participate to a mesh of Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path (this mesh of TE LSPs is identified by a mesh-group number). They are both used in the context of MPLS Traffic Engineering. Additional OSPF TE capability TLVs may be added in further revision of this draft. Those OSPF TE capability TLVs will be carried within the OSPF router information LSA (opaque type of 4, opaque ID of 0) defined in [18].</t>
