      <t>SSH (Secure Shell) is a program to log into another computer over a network, to execute commands in a remote machine, and to move files from one machine to another. It provides strong authentication and secure communications over insecure networks. It is intended as a possible replacement for rsh, rlogin, rcp, and rdist. Ssh closes several security holes in existing remote login and file transfer protocols (IP spoofing, routing manipulation, DNS manipulation, trojan horses, man-in-the-middle attacks). Additionally, all communications are encrypted to ensure privacy and integrity. It automatically forwards X11 connections over the secure channel (providing secure X11 sessions and automatic secure authentication information distribution). Arbitrary TCP/IP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel. An authentication agent permits authentication keys to reside on a laptop, or eventually even on a smartcard. Ssh also includes several convenience features, such as returning the correct exit status, automatic setting of DISPLAY and X11 authentication data, enhanced configurability, and the ability to run remote commands on a pty.</t>
