      <t>This document defines chaining arguments that can be applied to anyLDAP operation for distributed/chained server to server operations.This approach to distribution for LDAP systems, enables a consistenttransition of the LDAP single server environments, to the fullfunctionality of X.500 distributed directory systems. This proposalis supported by two other proposals previously submitted as&lt;draft-lloyd-ldap-svcs-00.txt&gt; and &lt;draft-lloyd-list-read-00.txt&gt;.These proposals require that LDAP V3 is evolved to LDAP V4. LDAP V4will enable LDAP clients and servers that access and interwork withX.500 systems, to more readily use (and integrate with) the fulldistribution and replication services offered by X.500. In additionthis approach will provide better compatability with the higherfunctionality afforded to X.500 DAP clients.(Although the commonly known information restrictions of LDAP stringencoding may still apply). The Chaining controls proposed in this draft will be carried with theoriginal LDAP access client controls as defined in&lt;draft-lloyd-ldap-svcs-00.txt&gt; in the standard LDAP V4 operations(Search, List, etc) when it is used for server - server communication.ie. chaining.</t>
