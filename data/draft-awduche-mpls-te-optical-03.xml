      <t>This document describes an approach to the design of control planesfor optical crossconnects (OXCs), which leverages existing controlplane techniques developed for MPLS Traffic Engineering. Theproposed approach combines recent advances in MPLS trafficengineering control plane constructs with OXC technology to: (1)provide a framework for real-time provisioning of optical channels inautomatically switched optical networks, (2) foster the expediteddevelopment and deployment of a new class of versatile OXCs, and (3)allow the use of uniform semantics for network management andoperations control in hybrid networks consisting of OXCs and labelswitching routers (LSRs). The proposed approach is particularlyadvantageous for OXCs intended for data-centric opticalinternetworking systems. In such environments, it will help tosimplify network administration. This approach also paves the wayfor the eventual incorporation of DWDM multiplexing capabilities inIP routers.</t>
