    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an approach to the design of control planes for optical crossconnects (OXCs), which leverages existing control plane techniques developed for MPLS Traffic Engineering. The proposed approach combines recent advances in MPLS traffic engineering control plane constructs with OXC technology to: (1) provide a framework for real-time provisioning of optical channels in automatically switched optical networks, (2) foster the expedited development and deployment of a new class of versatile OXCs, and (3) allow the use of uniform semantics for network management and operations control in hybrid networks consisting of OXCs and label switching routers (LSRs). The proposed approach is particularly advantageous for OXCs intended for data-centric optical internetworking systems. In such environments, it will help to simplify network administration. This approach also paves the way for the eventual incorporation of DWDM multiplexing capabilities in IP routers.</t>
