      <t>Currently, network operators are trying to provide fine-granularity Service Level Agreement (SLA) guarantee to achieve better Quality of Experience (QoE) for end users and engage customers, such as ultra- low latency and high reliability service. However, with increasing security threats, differentiated QoE services are insufficient, the demands for more differentiated security service are emerging. This document explores the requirements for differentiated security services and identifies the scenarios for network operators. To provide differentiated security services, possible trustworthiness- based routing solution is discussed.</t>
