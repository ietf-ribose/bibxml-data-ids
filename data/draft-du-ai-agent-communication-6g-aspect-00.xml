      <t>AI Agent can do some tasks as an assistant to human beings. During the task process, the Agent may need to connect to other Agents with different skills relative to the task. The Agent to Agent communication is a new kind of traffic for Internet, and some new requirements for networking are proposed. This document talks about the requirements and key issues of global AI agent communication towards 6G. Some 6G related use cases from 3GPP documents are introduced. After that, the related requirements for the AI Agent Communication Network (ACN) are proposed, and potential ACN frameworks and standardization works for the AI Agent Communication are also discussed.</t>
