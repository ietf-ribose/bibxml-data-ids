      <t>This document establishes an address allocation framework for Geographically Aggregatable Provider Independent (GAPI) IPv6 addresses for the purpose of multihoming. A /16 is divided in a hierarchical manner over geographical entities such as parts of continents, countries, states, provinces and metropolitan areas, with each receiving one or more /32 allocations from which end-user assignments can be made. The number of /32 allocations for a geographical entity depends on the current population. This address allocation framework in itself does not present a scalable multihoming solution, it merely provides a necessary building block for such solutions.</t>
