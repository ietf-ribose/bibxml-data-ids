      <t>This document discusses problems arising out of the use of Mobile IP in a security conscious Internet and presents a list of solution requirements deemed important. These problems may need to be resolved in several stages. A priority order in which these problems should be solved is also proposed. All firewalls are assumed to implement standard mechanisms [RFCs 1825,1826,1827] for authentication and encryption proposed by the IPSec working group of the IETF.</t>
