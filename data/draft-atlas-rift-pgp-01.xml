    <abstract>
      <t>In a fat tree, it can be sometimes desirable to guide traffic to particular destinations or keep specific flows to certain paths. In RIFT, this traffic steering/engineering is done by using policy- guided prefixes with their associated communities. Routes based on policy-guided prefixes are preferred over regular routes. Any node can originate a policy-guided prefix and advertise it in both north and south directions, and the calculation in both directions are distance vector based.</t>
