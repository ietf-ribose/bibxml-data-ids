      <t>A common strategy of SMTP servers when deciding whether to accept anemail or not, is to ensure that the 2821.MailFrom contains a domainwilling to accept non-delivery email (aka bounces).When the 2821.MailFrom domain has a DNS MX Resource Record (RR), it ismaking an explicit statement that it is willing to acceptemail. However, when the domain has just a DNS A (or AAAA) RR, thereis no such clarity as most hosts on the Internet advertise an A RRregardless of whether they want to accept email or not.The NULL MX RR formalizes the existing mechanism by which a domaincommunicates that it will never accept email.</t>
