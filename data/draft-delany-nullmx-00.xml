      <t>A common strategy of SMTP servers when deciding whether to accept an email or not, is to ensure that the 2821.MailFrom contains a domain willing to accept non-delivery email (aka bounces). When the 2821.MailFrom domain has a DNS MX Resource Record (RR), it is making an explicit statement that it is willing to accept email. However, when the domain has just a DNS A (or AAAA) RR, there is no such clarity as most hosts on the Internet advertise an A RR regardless of whether they want to accept email or not. The NULL MX RR formalizes the existing mechanism by which a domain communicates that it will never accept email.</t>
