      <t>Today most smart terminals are equiped with multiple interfaces such as 3G/LTE and WiFi, and users experience some loss of connectivity while switching interfaces. The MIF API draft [I-D.ietf-mif-api-extension] has specified an API to announce interface status information to the applications. Once the application receives such information, it can use this information reconnect to its peer(s), and this could significantly improve the user experience.</t>
