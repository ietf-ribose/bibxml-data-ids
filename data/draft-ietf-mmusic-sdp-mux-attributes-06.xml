      <t>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) provides mechanisms to describe attributes of multimedia sessions and of individual media streams (e.g., Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions) within a multimedia session. [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation] provides SDP extensions to negotiate the usage of single 5-tuple for sending and receiving media associated with multiple media descriptions ("m=" lines). Such a mechanism has made it necessary to understand the semantic implications of the SDP attributes associated with the RTP Media Streams multiplexed over a single underlying transport layer flow. The purpose of this specification is to provide a framework for analyzing the multiplexing characteristics of SDP attributes. This specification also categorizes the existing SDP attributes based on the framework described herein.</t>
