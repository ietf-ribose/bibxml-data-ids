    <abstract>
      <t>We propose a diff-serv per hop behavior (PHB) for the transport of non-real time traffic with a guaranteed rate (GR). This proposal is based on principles developed for the specification of the Guaranteed Frame Rate (GFR) service category currently being specified for ATM [TM5]. It is shown that a diff-serv network using the GR PHB together with a explicit routing capability can support edge-to-edge guaranteed rate service. Interconnection of diff-serv networks deploying GR to achieve end-to-end service and interworking with ATM's GFR service are also discussed.</t>
