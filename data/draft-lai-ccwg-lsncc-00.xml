    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides a performance analysis on various congestion control algorithms(CCAs) in an operational low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite network (LSN). Internet CCAs are expected to perform well in any Internet path, including those paths with LEO satellite links. Our analysis results reveal that existing CCAs struggle to deal with the drastic network variations caused by the mobility of LEO satellites, resulting in poor link utilization or high latency. Further, this document discusses the key challenges of achieving high throughput and low latency for end-to-end connections over an LSN, and provides useful information when the LSN-specific congestion control principles for the Internet is standardized in the future.</t>
