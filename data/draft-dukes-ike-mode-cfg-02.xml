      <t>This document describes a new ISAKMP method that allows configuration items to be exchanged securely by using both push/acknowledge or request/reply paradigms. The authors currently intend this document to be published as an Informational RFC, not a standards-track document, so that the many IPsec implementations that have implemented to earlier drafts of this protocol can have a single stable reference. Comments regarding this draft should be sent to ietf-mode- cfg@vpnc.org or to the authors.</t>
