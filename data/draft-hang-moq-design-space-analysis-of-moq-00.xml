      <t>This document investigates potential solution directions within the charter scope of MoQ WG. MoQ aims to provide low-latency, efficient media delivery solution for use cases including live streaming, gaming and video conferencing. To achieve low-latency media transfer efficiently, the network topology of relay nodes and the computation done at the relay nodes should be considered carefully. This document provides the analysis of those factors which can help the design of the MoQ protocols.</t>
