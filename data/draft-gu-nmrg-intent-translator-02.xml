    <abstract>
      <t>The evolution of 6G networks and the expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) environments introduce new challenges in managing diverse networked resources. Intent-based management frameworks enable operators to express desired network outcomes using high-level intents, often articulated in natural language. However, converting these expressions into machine-executable policy configurations remains an open challenge. This document defines an intent translation framework designed to bridge the gap between user-issued intents and structured policy representations for 6G enabled IoT systems. The framework accepts natural language intent as input and produces a policy document in a structured format, such as YAML, that aligns with the intent model defined in 3GPP in [TS-28.312]. The framework consists of modular components responsible for processing input, aligning user intent with domain knowledge, evaluating semantic confidence, and generating standardized output. This modularity supports transparency, interoperability, and automated policy enforcement in next-generation network infrastructures.</t>
