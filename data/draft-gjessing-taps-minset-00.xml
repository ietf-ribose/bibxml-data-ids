      <t>This draft will eventually recommend a minimal set of IETF Transport Services offered by end systems supporting TAPS, and give guidance on choosing among the available mechanisms and protocols. As a starting point for discussion, it currently only gives an overview of some ways to categorize the set of transport services in the first TAPS document (version 4: draft-ietf-taps-transports-04), assuming that the eventual minimal set of transport services will be based on a similar form of categorization.</t>
