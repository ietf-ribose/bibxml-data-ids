      <t>The purpose of this memo is to document how the requirements for advancing a routing protocol to Full Standard have been satisfied by Border Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGP-4). This report documents experience with BGP. It is the second of two reports on the BGP protocol. The remaining sections of this memo document how BGP satisfies General Requirements specified in Section 3.0, as well as the Requirements for Full Standard as specified in Section 6.0 of the 'Internet Routing Protocol Standardization Criteria' document [1]. Please send comments to bgp@ans.net.</t>
