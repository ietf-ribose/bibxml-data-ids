      <t>This document discusses the problem statement and use cases of IPv6 Mobile Object Networking (IPMON). A moving object is a physically movable networked device with 5G communication capability, such as a terrestrial vehicle (e.g., car and motorcycle), a user's smart device (e.g., smartphone, smart watch, and tablet), an aerial vehicle (e.g., drone and helicopter), and a marine vehicle (e.g., boat and ship). These mobile objects are called vehicles in this document. The main scenarios of vehicular communications are vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications. First, this document explains use cases using V2V, V2I, and V2X networking over 5G. Next, for IPv6-over-5G vehicular networks, it makes a gap analysis of current IPv6 protocols (e.g., IPv6 Neighbor Discovery).</t>
