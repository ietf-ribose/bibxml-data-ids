    <abstract>
      <t>Electronic mail is one of the oldest Internet applications that is still in very active use. While the basic protocols and formats for mail transport and message formats have evolved slowly over the years, events and thinking in more recent years have supplemented those core protocols with additional features and suggestions for their use. This Applicability Statement describes the relationship among many of those protocols and provides guidance and makes recommendations for the use of features of the core protocols. Open Issues * #40 - Recommended SMTP Extensions (https://github.com/ietf-wg- emailcore/emailcore/issues/40): Is the new proposed text regarding DSNs in Section 2.4 satisfactory? * #78 - Advice against using URL %-encoding on non-ASCII email addresses (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/ issues/78): Is the new proposed text in Section 4.2 satisfactory? * #79 - Add Internationalization Considerations Section (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/79): Are the references in Section 2.4 sufficient? * #84 - Handling of Trace Header Fields by MUAs (https://github.com/ ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/84): Is the proposed new text in Section 3.3 satisfactory? * #85 - What mail agents should do/not do with Received header fields (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/85): Is the proposed new text in Section 3.2.2 satisfactory? * #92 - CNAME handling in "5.1.
