      <t>Telnet is a protocol that may be operated in either a peer-to-peer, fully symmetric mode, or asymmetrically, in a host-terminal mode. Although the original intention for the NVT mode of operation was both asymmetric and half-duplex, where neither the host nor the terminal echoed characters back to one another, the most common mode of usage has come to be one of asymmetric full-duplex communications, where all terminal characters are first transmitted to the host computer and then echoed back to the terminal before being displayed.</t>
