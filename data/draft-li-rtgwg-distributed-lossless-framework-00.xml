    <abstract>
      <t>With the rapid development of large language models, it puts forward higher requirements for the networking scale of data centers. Distributed model training has been proposed to shorten the training time and relieve the resource demand in a single data center.This document proposes a framework to address the challenge of efficient lossless interconnection and reliable data transmission between multiple data centers, which can connect multiple data centers to form a larger cluster through network connection. The document further conducts in-depth research on the key technologies and application scenarios of this distributed AIDC network.</t>
