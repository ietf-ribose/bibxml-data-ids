      <t>P4P is a framework that enables Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and network application software distributors to work jointly and cooperatively to optimize application communications. The goals of this cooperation are to reduce network resource consumption and to accelerate network applications. In this document, we specify how P4P allows ISPs to provide network guidance to applications, allowing clients to exchange data more effectively. The applications we focus on are those that can have a choice in connection patterns, in particular peer-to-peer (P2P) applications.</t>
