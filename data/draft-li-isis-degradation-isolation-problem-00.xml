      <t>IS-IS protocol specifies a procedure that if a Link State Protocol Data Unit (LSP) with an incorrect LSP Checksum is received, the corruptedLSPReceived circuit event will be generated and the corrupted LSP will be discarded. This document aims to emphasize that although this procedure can maintain the network stability, it can not diagnose and isolate the source of the network problem. In some cases this procedure will create bad effect on the services carried by the network. This document suggests that IS-IS protocol introduce the mechanism for link degradation detection and isolation, which should be triggered when corrupted LSP is received.</t>
