    <abstract>
      <t>The current Internet routing architecture does not provide for a scalable multi-homing solution. Scalability of the interdomain routing architecture is already a problem and is expected to become an even larger problem if millions of home users and small businesses will start to use multi-homing technology in order to achieve redundancy and reliability that traditionally can only be provided by BGP multi-homing. Authors believe that it is possible to solve the problems of end- users and small businesses with a multi-addressing mechanism and source address selection mechanism instead of using the routing system. This draft proposes a setup that will allow us to try a multi- addressing solution. Instead of trying to solve the problems for more complex network setups, it was decided to go for a solution that covers most simple setups but that cover the majority of home and small business networks. Authors believe that we can more easily reach progress by starting with a simple solution that can later be extended to solve the issues of a larger class of users.</t>
