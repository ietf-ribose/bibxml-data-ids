      <t>The current Internet routing architecture does not provide for ascalable multi-homing solution. Scalability of the interdomainrouting architecture is already a problem and is expected to becomean even larger problem if millions of home users and smallbusinesses will start to use multi-homing technology in order toachieve redundancy and reliability that traditionally can only beprovided by BGP multi-homing.Authors believe that it is possible to solve the problems of end-users and small businesses with a multi-addressing mechanism andsource address selection mechanism instead of using the routingsystem.This draft proposes a setup that will allow us to try a multi-addressing solution. Instead of trying to solve the problems formore complex network setups, it was decided to go for a solutionthat covers most simple setups but that cover the majority of homeand small business networks. Authors believe that we can more easilyreach progress by starting with a simple solution that can later beextended to solve the issues of a larger class of users.</t>
