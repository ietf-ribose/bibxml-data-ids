      <t>This document specifies an Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO) service for IP internetworking over Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI) interfaces. AERO/OMNI use an IPv6 link-local address format that supports operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol and links ND to IP forwarding. Prefix delegation/registration services are employed for network admission and to manage the routing system. Secure multilink operation, mobility management, multicast, quality of service (QoS) signaling and route optimization are naturally supported through dynamic neighbor cache updates. AERO is a widely-applicable mobile internetworking service especially well- suited to aviation services, intelligent transportation systems, mobile Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and many other applications.</t>
