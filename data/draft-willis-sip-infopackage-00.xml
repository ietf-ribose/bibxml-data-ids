      <t>The SIP INFO method (RFC 2976) establishes a method by which applications may transfer application-specific information within a SIP dialog. However, RFC 2976 does not provide a mechanism for describing and documenting an application of INFO, nor does it provide a mechanism by which applications may negotiate such uses. This document provides a framework for documenting and naming specific uses of INFO (called INFO packages), for registering those package names with IANA, and for negotiating the support for various INFO packages between applications using SIP.</t>
