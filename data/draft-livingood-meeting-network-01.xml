      <t>IETF participants need a highly reliable and responsive network, with sufficient bandwidth to avoid congestion, that enables work to be conducted without interruption or network limitation during an IETF meeting. Such a network enables in-person network attendees to get their work done. It also enables remote participants to have a good experience as well, via remote participation in working group meetings. This document makes suggestions about how to reduce complexity, reduce cost, and increase reliability of the IETF meeting network, which may be helpful in community discussion.</t>
