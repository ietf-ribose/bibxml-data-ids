      <t>With the current multicast address architecture and the proposed multicast address architecture, a set of guidelines is needed for multicast address allocation servers to use in assigning IPv6 multicast addresses. The purpose of these rules is to reduce the possibility of address collision not only at layer 3, but also on devices at layer 2.</t>
