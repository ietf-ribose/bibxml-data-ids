      <t>The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language used to create hypertext documents that are platform independent. Initially HTML was designed primarily for Western European languages; most of the issues of basic internationalization to make HTML better usable for other languages have in the meantime been addressed. Ruby are important phonetic annotations used mainly for ideographic characters in East Asia. This document proposes markup for ruby in HTML and explains its usage.</t>
