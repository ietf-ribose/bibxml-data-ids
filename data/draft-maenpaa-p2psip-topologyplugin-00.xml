    <abstract>
      <t>REsource LOcation And Discovery (RELOAD) is a peer-to-peer signaling protocol that can be used to maintain an overlay network, and to store data in and retrieve data from the overlay. This document defines a new topology plug-in for RELOAD that is more appropriate for real world large scale overlays. This topology plug-in implements three important functionalities that allow RELOAD to operate under real world constraints. First, it includes a load balancing algorithm that specifies efficient allocation of load to different nodes in the network. Second, the document describes robust techniques for stabilization of fingers and successors and specifies self tuning mechanisms that allow dynamic and automatic adjustment of parameters needed for these advanced techniques in the topology plug-in. Finally, it specifies a locality aware finger selection algorithm that reduces average lookup latency.</t>
