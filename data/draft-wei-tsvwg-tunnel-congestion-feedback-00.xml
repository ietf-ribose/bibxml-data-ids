      <t>This document describes a mechanism to calculate congestion of a tunnel segment based on RFC 6040 recommendations, and a feedback protocol by which to send the measured congestion of the tunnel from egress to ingress router. A basic model for measuring tunnel congestion and feedback is described, and a protocol for carrying the feedback data is outlined.</t>
