    <abstract>
      <t>An SDF specification can describe the definition of a Things, i.e., physical objects and their associated interactions and express the various information that be exchanged for the interactions. Therefore, the SDF format can be used to define the behaviour of an object and its associated data model and interaction model in a digital twin system that has an object as a component. In a digital twin system, interactions between physical and virtual objects, as well as interactions of objects existing in the different digital twin systems, are performed over a network, which is important to provide location information of objects during interactions. This document specifies the extension information of SDF to represent the location information of an objects.</t>
