      <t>This document presents a first attempt at evaluating the recently published RFC. We analyze a set of randomly chosen RFC approved in 2018, looking for history and delays. The average RFC was produced in 3 years and 4 months, of which 2 years and 10 months were spent in the working group, 3 to 4 months for IETF consensus and IESG review, and 3 to 4 months in RFC production. The main variation in RFC production delays comes from the AUTH48 phase. We also measure the number of citations of the chosen RFC using Semantic Scholar, and compare citation counts with what we know about deployment. We show that citation counts indicate academic interest, but correlate only loosely with deployment or usage of the specifications. The measurement of delays could be automated by processing dates and events recorded in the data tracker. The measurement of published RFC could be complemented by statistics on abandoned drafts, which would measure the efficiency of the IETF triaging process.</t>
