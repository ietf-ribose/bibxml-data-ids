      <t>A Stateful PCE maintains information about LSP characteristics and resource usage within the network in order to provide traffic engineering calculations for its associated PCCs. This document describes general considerations for stateful PCEP and examines its applicability and benefits through a number of use cases. PCEP extensions required for stateful PCE usage are covered in separate documents.</t>
