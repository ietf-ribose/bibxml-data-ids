      <t>This API is a means for sockets applications to request network security services from an operating system. It is designed to move most of the work and intelligence of security policy processing into the operating system so that the burden on application authors is light enough to encourage the use of network security. It is documented here for the benefit of others who might also adopt and use the API, thus providing increased portability of applications that use network security services (e.g., the IP Security ESP and AH protocols).</t>
