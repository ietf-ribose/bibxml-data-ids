      <t>This document presents a new algorithm method for rekeying multicastgroups. It takes advantage of the mathematical properties of modularreduction in order to reduce the number of messages needed for rekeying.Moreover the technique is very suitable for batch processing. Itachieves greater bandwidth reduction than other existing batch techniques. Batch processing techniques are specially suitable for benchmarks scenarios where a great amount of users can join or leave the group at once (typically single source broadcast). One of the mostimportant items to take into account when performing batch rekeying isthat key trees must be kept balanced all the time. Current methods forbatch rekeying assure tree balancing by adding an additional method tousual rekeying. We propose a batch rekeying method that allows membersto change their position in the key tree. This change has to be notifiedto single members with the updated keys. An adaptation of the GDOIprotocol in order to contain this information is finally proposed.</t>
