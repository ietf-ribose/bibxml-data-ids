      <t>This document describes how an IPv6 residential Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) can have a balanced security policy that allows for a mostly end-to-end connectivity while keeping the major threats outside of the home. It is documenting an existing IPv6 deployment by Swisscom and allows all packets inbound/outbound EXCEPT for some layer-4 ports where attacks and vulnerabilities (such as weak passwords) are well-known. The policy is a proposed set of rules that can be used as a default setting. The set of blocked inbound and outbound ports is expected to be updated as threats come and go.</t>
