    <abstract>
      <t>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. The Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE) Label Switched Paths (LSPs) using PCEP. Furthermore, PCEP can be used for computing paths in SR networks. Stateful PCE provide active control of MPLS-TE LSPs via PCEP, for a model where the PCC delegates control over one or more locally configured LSPs to the PCE. Further, stateful PCE could also create and delete PCE-initiated LSPs itself. A PCE-based central controller (PCECC) simplify the processing of a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and without necessarily completely replacing it. In some use cases, such as PCECC, Binding Segment Identifier (SID), SR Path Identification, there is a requirement for a stateful PCE to make allocation of labels, SID, Path-ID respectively. These use cases require for the PCE to be aware of the various identifier space from which to make allocations on behalf of PCC. This documents specify a mechanism for a PCC to inform the PCE of the identifier space under its control via PCEP. The identifier could be MPLS label, SID, Path ID or another future identifier to be allocated by a PCE.</t>
