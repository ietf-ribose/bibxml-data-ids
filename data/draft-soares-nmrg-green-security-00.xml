    <abstract>
      <t>With the onset of the climate emergency, all areas of human activity are expected to continuously assess their Greenhouse Gas emissions and encourage the use of clean energy sources as much as possible. The current discussion on green networking in the Network Management research field still needs to be expanded to the adjoined areas, such as Network Security. This document summarizes the security considerations of the existing works and outlines possible research directions for energy-aware security mechanisms.</t>
