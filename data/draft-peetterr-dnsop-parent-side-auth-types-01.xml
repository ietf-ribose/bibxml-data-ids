    <abstract>
      <t>DNS RR types with numbers in the range 0xFA00-0xFDFF are now included in special treatment like DS RR type specified in [RFC4035]. Authoritative servers, DNSSEC signers, and recursive resolvers need to extend the conditions for DS special handling to also include this range. This means: being authoritative on the parent side of a delegation; being signed by the parent; being provided along with delegations by the parent. DNSSEC validators also need to implement downgrade protection described in Section 5.3.</t>
