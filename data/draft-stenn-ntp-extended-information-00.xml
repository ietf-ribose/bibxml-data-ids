      <t>The network packet format used by NTP has changed very little between NTPv1, defined by RFC 958 [RFC0958] in 1985, and NTPv4, defined by RFC 5905 [RFC5905]. The core network packet used by NTP has no spare bits available for reporting additinal state information and no larger data areas available for larger amounts of information. This proposal offers a new extension field that would contains this additional information.</t>
