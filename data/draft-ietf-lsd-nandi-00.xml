      <t>There are existing communities of LDAP, X.500 and Whois++ serverson the Internet. An LDAPv3 server can be a part of one of more ofthese communities. LDAP directory services would benefit fromreduced naming conflicts and increased ability to locate serversand information both within LDAP islands and between LDAP andother communities. This document recommends guidelines for namingand interconnection of LDAP servers to enable the existence ofcommunities of a loosely coupled LDAP-based directory service thatcan leverage the X.500 knowledge model and the existinginfrastructure of names from the Domain Name System (DNS). Thiswill facilitate the establishment of a global naming plan and theinterconnection of a global directory.</t>
