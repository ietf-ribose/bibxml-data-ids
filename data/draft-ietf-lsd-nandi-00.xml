      <t>There are existing communities of LDAP, X.500 and Whois++ servers on the Internet. An LDAPv3 server can be a part of one of more of these communities. LDAP directory services would benefit from reduced naming conflicts and increased ability to locate servers and information both within LDAP islands and between LDAP and other communities. This document recommends guidelines for naming and interconnection of LDAP servers to enable the existence of communities of a loosely coupled LDAP-based directory service that can leverage the X.500 knowledge model and the existing infrastructure of names from the Domain Name System (DNS). This will facilitate the establishment of a global naming plan and the interconnection of a global directory.</t>
