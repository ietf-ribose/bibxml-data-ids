    <abstract>
      <t>The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include query capabilities to find the list of domains related to a set of entities matching a given search pattern. In the RDAP context, an entity can be associated with any defined object class. Moreover, other relationships between object classes exist and might be used for providing a reverse search capability. Therefore, a reverse search can be applied to other use cases than the classic domain-entity scenario. This document describes RDAP query extensions that allow servers to provide a reverse search feature based on the relationship defined in RDAP between an object class for search and any related object class. The reverse search based on the domain-entity relationship is treated as a particular case but with a special focus on its privacy implications.</t>
