      <t>One of the basic limitations of the ATMARP service model specified in RFC 1577 [LAUB94] is the requirement that only one ATMARP server be utilized to provide the address resolution service for a given LIS. Besides introducing a single-point-of-failure into a LIS, this model also presents obvious scaling issues. A proposal was put forth in 'Classical IP and ARP over ATM Update' [LAUB95] to resolve these shortcomings through the introduction of a model supporting multiple ATMARP servers that maintain fully-replicated, synchronized address resolution databases. This model necessitates a certain amount of complexity introduced by the addition of a server database synchronization protocol. This synchronization protocol also requires additional packet types and formats as well as associated semantics. It is felt, however, that a fully-replicated, synchronized database scheme is not required to provide a reasonably robust ATMARP service that addresses the limitations of the basic model.</t>
