      <t>Discovering overlay networks and the resources found within in them presents a number of bootstrapping problems. While those hard problems are under discussion, this draft proposes a small set of mechanisms which are intended to be generically useful for providing pointers to peer-to-peer overlay networks in web pages, email messages, and other textual media. While the mechanisms described below each meet similar needs, they are not mutually exclusive; it is expected that each will find some useful deployment during the early days of peer-to-peer overlay deployment.</t>
