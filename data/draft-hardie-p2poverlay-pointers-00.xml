      <t>Discovering overlay networks and the resources found within in thempresents a number of bootstrapping problems. While those hardproblems are under discussion, this draft proposes a small set ofmechanisms which are intended to be generically useful forproviding pointers to peer-to-peer overlay networks in web pages,email messages, and other textual media. While the mechanismsdescribed below each meet similar needs, they are not mutuallyexclusive; it is expected that each will find some usefuldeployment during the early days of peer-to-peer overlaydeployment.</t>
