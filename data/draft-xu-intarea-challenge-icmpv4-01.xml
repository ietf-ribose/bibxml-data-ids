    <abstract>
      <t>The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) plays a crucial role in network diagnostics and error reporting. However, it is a challenge to verify the legitimacy of a received ICMP error message, particularly when the ICMP error message is embedded with stateless protocol data. As a result, adversaries can forge ICMP error messages, leading to potential exploitation and off-path attacks. This document explores solutions to this problem by first presenting a straightforward but flawed stateful challenge-response mechanism. It explains how this "strawman" approach, while preventing simple spoofing, introduces a severe vulnerability to state-exhaustion Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Building on this analysis, the document then proposes a robust, stateless challenge-response mechanism inspired by TCP SYN-Cookies. This final proposal eliminates the need to store per-challenge state by computationally generating challenges. It limits state management to minimal flags on existing sockets or a bounded probabilistic data structure. This approach effectively authenticates ICMP error messages while inherently resisting both off-path spoofing and state- exhaustion DoS attacks, thus significantly improving the robustness of ICMP. Additionally, it discusses security and deployment considerations to ensure its practical implementation.</t>
