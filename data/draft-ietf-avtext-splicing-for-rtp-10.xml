      <t>Content splicing is a process that replaces the content of a main multimedia stream with other multimedia content, and delivers the substitutive multimedia content to the receivers for a period of time. Splicing is commonly used for local advertisement insertion by cable operators, replacing a national advertisement content with a local advertisement. This memo describes some use cases for content splicing and a set of requirements for splicing content delivered by RTP. It provides concrete guidelines for how an RTP mixer can be used to handle content splicing.</t>
