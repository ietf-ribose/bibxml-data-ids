      <t>Various pieces of network testing equipment currently often report a characteristic that is referred to as a 'degree (or percentage) of packet reordering'. The way this metric is computed is often undocumented and it differs between vendors. Having a useful numeric measure of the degree of packet reordering is important for applications such as TCP and VoIP on different ends of the spectrum. However, the metric that makes sense for one application may have no or little applicability to another. This document introduces a definition of reordering metric that is hoped to be applicable to a number of different applications by parametrizing the metric.</t>
