      <t>This memo describes an information exchange protocol which enables IP nodes (hosts or routers) to associate various kinds of 'flow' with 'datalink connections'. By performing such an information exchange between adjacent nodes, some of functions performed in the routers (e.g., classification of datagrams with regard to output interface and/or requesting service class) would be able to be carried out without (or before) analyzing each datagram but by referring to a datalink connection ID which conveys the datagram. This facilitates the routers to provide high-throughput and QoS-supported services much more efficiently.</t>
