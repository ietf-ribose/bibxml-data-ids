    <abstract>
      <t>In large-scale deterministic networks (LDN), App-flows need to span multiple deterministic network domains, and the latency in multiple domains is added together. The jitter will be increased. In order to realize the protection service function, App-flows should be transmitted on multiple paths. The delay difference in data transmission on different paths is no different from jitter in end- to-end services. Jitter generated by various factors needs to be controlled to meet business requirements. This document describes the end-to-end jitter reduction mechanism in an LDN. This mechanism can effectively control the end-to-end jitter to meet specific business needs and make the planning of multiple paths for service protection more flexible.</t>
