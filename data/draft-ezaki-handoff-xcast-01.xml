    <abstract>
      <t>For a handoff action using the mobile IPv6, we need two functions: re-routing on the wired region of the network and the activation of the air-link on the wireless region. In this architecture, a possibility of small break for a session is still large by the signaling overhead between Home Agent and Mobile Node (MN). We propose a new handoff method using the Explicit Multicast (xcast) technique. On the wired section, control/user packets are multicasted by xcast scheme to the Base Stations where MN can receive, then packets are passed to the air-link activated between a BS and the MN.</t>
