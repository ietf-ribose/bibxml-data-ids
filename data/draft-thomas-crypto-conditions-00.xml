      <t>Crypto-conditions provide a mechanism to describe a signed message such that multiple actors in a distributed system can all verify the same signed message and agree on whether it matches the description. This provides a useful primitive for event-based systems that are distributed on the Internet since we can describe events in a standard deterministic manner (represented by signed messages) and therefore define generic authenticated event handlers.</t>
