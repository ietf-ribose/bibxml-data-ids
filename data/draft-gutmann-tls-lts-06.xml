      <t>This document specifies an update of TLS 1.2 for long-term support, one that incoporates as far as possible what's already deployed for TLS 1.2 but with the security holes and bugs fixed. This represents a stable, known-good version that can be deployed to systems that can't roll out ongoing patches and updates every time a new attack on standard TLS appears.</t>
