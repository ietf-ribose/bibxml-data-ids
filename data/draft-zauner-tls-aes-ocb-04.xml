      <t>This memo describes the use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in the Offset Codebook Mode (OCB) of operation within Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS) to provide confidentiality and data origin authentication. The AES-OCB algorithm is highly parallelizable, provable secure and can be efficiently implemented in software and hardware providing high performance. Furthermore, use of AES-OCB in TLS is exempt from former IPR claims by various parties.</t>
