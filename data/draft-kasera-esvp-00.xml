      <t>This note describes a new IPsec option called EncapsulatingSecurity Variable Payload (ESVP) that allows a variable butcontiguous portion of the payload received from upper protocollayers to be encrypted/authenticated between the two end-points ofa security association. The remaining portion of the payload isleft in the clear. The upper layer payload contains the upperlayer protocol headers and data. The decision about whichportions of the payload should be available as cleartext is takenonly by the end-points of the security association. By leaving acertain portion of the payload as cleartext, ESVP provides theoption of encrypting and decrypting an IPsec ESVP datagram atother protocol layers to allow limited and secure access to thecleartext data at these protocol layers. These layers could beterminated inside the network for providing network-based valueadded services and performance optimizations. These network-basedvalue added services and performance optimizations include policyimplementation and QoS based on packet classification, TCPperformance enhancement in the case of wireless networks andfirewall services.</t>
