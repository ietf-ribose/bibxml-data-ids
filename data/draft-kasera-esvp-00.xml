      <t>This note describes a new IPsec option called Encapsulating Security Variable Payload (ESVP) that allows a variable but contiguous portion of the payload received from upper protocol layers to be encrypted/authenticated between the two end-points of a security association. The remaining portion of the payload is left in the clear. The upper layer payload contains the upper layer protocol headers and data. The decision about which portions of the payload should be available as cleartext is taken only by the end-points of the security association. By leaving a certain portion of the payload as cleartext, ESVP provides the option of encrypting and decrypting an IPsec ESVP datagram at other protocol layers to allow limited and secure access to the cleartext data at these protocol layers. These layers could be terminated inside the network for providing network-based value added services and performance optimizations. These network-based value added services and performance optimizations include policy implementation and QoS based on packet classification, TCP performance enhancement in the case of wireless networks and firewall services.</t>
