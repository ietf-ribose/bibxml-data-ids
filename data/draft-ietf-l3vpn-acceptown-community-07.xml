    <abstract>
      <t>Under certain conditions it is desirable for a BGP route reflector to be able to modify the Route Target list of a VPN route that is distributed by the route reflector, enabling the route reflector to control how a route originated within one VRF is imported into other VRFs. This technique works effectively as long as the VRF that exports the route is not on the same PE as the VRF(s) that import the route. However, due to the constraints of the BGP protocol, it does not work if the two are on the same PE. This document describes a modification to the BGP protocol allowing this technique to work when the VRFs are on the same PE, allowing the technique to be used in a standard manner throughout an autonomous system.</t>
