      <t>The Semantic Definition Format (SDF) is a format for domain experts to use in the creation and maintenance of data and interaction models that describe Things, i.e., physical objects that are available for interaction over a network. It was created as a common language for use in the development of the One Data Model liaison organization (OneDM) models. Tools convert this format to database formats and other serializations as needed. An SDF specification often needs to be augmented by additional information that is specific to its use in a particular ecosystem or application. SDF mapping files provide a mechanism to represent this augmentation.</t>
