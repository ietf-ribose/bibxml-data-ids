      <t>When an application runs on a host or network that only supports IPv6("IPv6-only"), it is sometimes necessary that the applicationcommunicate with IPv4 peers. When that communication involves DNS,DNS64 and a 6/4 translator works well without any changes to mostapplications. However, when that communication does not involve DNS,it can require additional features be configured on or programmedinto the IPv6 application. This document explains why thisfunctionality is important and describes mechanisms for applicationsto provide such functionality.</t>
