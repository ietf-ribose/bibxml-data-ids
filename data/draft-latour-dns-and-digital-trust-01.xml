    <abstract>
      <t>This memo describes an architecture for digital credential verification and validation using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), distributed ledgers, trust registries, and the DNS. This architecture provides a verifier with a simple process by which to cryptographically verify the credential they are being presented with, verify and resolve the issuer of that credential to a domain, and verify that issuer's membership in a trust registry.</t>
