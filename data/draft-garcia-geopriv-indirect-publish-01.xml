    <abstract>
      <t>A method for indirectly publishing presence information is described. This allows a presentity user agent to publish a URI that can be used by the presence agent to retrieve presence information. A presence agent is then better able to acquire dynamic presence information without relying on the presentity user agent. This also allows a presentity user agent to delegate responsibility for managing changing presence data to the source of that information.</t>
