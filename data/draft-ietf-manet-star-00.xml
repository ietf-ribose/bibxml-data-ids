      <t>The Source-Tree Adaptive Routing (STAR) protocol is intended for useby nodes (static and mobile) in an ad hoc network or an internet. Arouter in STAR communicates to its neighbors the parameters of itssource routing tree, which consists of each link that the routerneeds to reach every known destination (and address range) in the adhoc network or internet. To conserve transmission bandwidth andenergy, a router communicates changes to its source routing tree onlywhen the router detects new destinations, the possibility of looping,or the possibility of node failures or network partitions.</t>
