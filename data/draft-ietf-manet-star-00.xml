      <t>The Source-Tree Adaptive Routing (STAR) protocol is intended for use by nodes (static and mobile) in an ad hoc network or an internet. A router in STAR communicates to its neighbors the parameters of its source routing tree, which consists of each link that the router needs to reach every known destination (and address range) in the ad hoc network or internet. To conserve transmission bandwidth and energy, a router communicates changes to its source routing tree only when the router detects new destinations, the possibility of looping, or the possibility of node failures or network partitions.</t>
