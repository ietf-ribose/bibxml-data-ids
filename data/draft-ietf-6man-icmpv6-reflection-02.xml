    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the ICMPv6 Reflection utility. The ICMPv6 Reflection utility is a diagnostic tool, similar to Ping and the ICMPv6 Probe utility. It is similar to Ping and Probe because it relies on a stateless message exchange between a probing node and a probed node. The probing node sends a query to the probed node and the probed node responds appropriately. The ICMPv6 Reflection utility differs from Ping and Probe because in the ICMPv6 Reflection utility, the probing node requests a snapshot of the query, as it arrived at the probed node. The probed node returns the requested snapshot. The ICMPv6 Reflection utility is useful because it allows its user to see how the network modified the query as it traveled from the probing node to the probed node.</t>
