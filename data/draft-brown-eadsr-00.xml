      <t>The energy aware dynamic source routing (EADSR) protocol is an extension to the dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol for mobile ad hoc networks. It retains the features and benefits of DSR while it incorporates new features for energy limited nodes. The EADSR features include (1) a DSR header option so that link power costs can be passed with source routes; (2) an extended route discovery protocol to find lower energy routes than minimum hop routes; and (3) an additional route maintenance mechanism that allows the source node to respond to link changes without route disruption. The protocol is able to find routes with minimum total transmit power cost. It is able to track changes in link power on a route, choose between routes based on cost, and notify the source of new lower cost routes as they become available. This document specifies the EADSR header option and operation changes to DSR.</t>
