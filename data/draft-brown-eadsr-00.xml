      <t>The energy aware dynamic source routing (EADSR) protocol is anextension to the dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol for mobile adhoc networks. It retains the features and benefits of DSR while itincorporates new features for energy limited nodes. The EADSRfeatures include (1) a DSR header option so that link power costscan be passed with source routes; (2) an extended route discoveryprotocol to find lower energy routes than minimum hop routes; and(3) an additional route maintenance mechanism that allows the sourcenode to respond to link changes without route disruption. Theprotocol is able to find routes with minimum total transmit powercost. It is able to track changes in link power on a route, choosebetween routes based on cost, and notify the source of new lowercost routes as they become available. This document specifies theEADSR header option and operation changes to DSR.</t>
