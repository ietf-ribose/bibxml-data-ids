      <t>This memo specifies two new algorithms. One is the usage of XCBCmode with Camellia block cipher on the authentication mechanism ofthe IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload and Authentication Headerprotocols. This algorithm is called Camellia-XCBC-96. Latter ispseudo-random function based on XCBC with Camellia block cipher forInternet Key Exchange. This algorithm is called Camellia-XCBC-PRF-128.</t>
