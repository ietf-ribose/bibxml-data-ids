      <t>An ad hoc mobile network is a collection of nodes, each of whichcommunicates over wireless channels and is capable of movement.Nodes participating in such an ad hoc network communicate ona peer-to-peer basis. Flooding is often a desired form ofcommunication in these networks, as it can enable both thedissemination of control information and the delivery of datapackets. This document describes a method for sending packets toevery node in an d hoc networks.</t>
