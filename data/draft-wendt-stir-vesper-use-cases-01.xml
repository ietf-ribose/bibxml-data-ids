      <t>This document discusses a set of use cases and requirements for an extension to Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) called Verifiable STI PERsona (VESPER). VESPER fundamentally enhances STIR by establishing an authoritative and cryptographically verifiable Right-to-Use (RTU) relationship between telephone numbers and their assigned entities, business organizations or individuals, through digital signatures that bind an entity to a set of asserted claims, delegate certificates that govern the assertion of those claims to a responsible party, and Authority Tokens that prove the validitation of those claims by authoritative parties. This cryptographic binding ensures explicit non-repudiation, removing ambiguity around who is accountable for calls or messages originating from specific telephone numbers, significantly deterring spoofing and fraud.</t>
