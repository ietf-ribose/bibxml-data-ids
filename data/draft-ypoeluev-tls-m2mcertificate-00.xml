      <t>This memo defines Transport Layer Security (TLS) extensions andassociated semantics that allow clients and servers to negotiate theuse of M2M certificates for a TLS/DTLS session, and specifies how totransport M2M certificates via TLS/DTLS. It also defines the registryfor non-X.509 certificate types.The X.509 public key certificate format is overly verbose for Internet-of-Things (IoT) constrained environments, where nodes with limitedmemory and networks with limited bandwidth are not uncommon. TheMachine-to-Machine (M2M) certificate format is a pruned down andencoding-optimized replacement for X.509, which reuses much of theX.509 semantics but reduces certificate sizes by typically 40%.</t>
