      <t>This document specifies a Uniform Resource Name (URN) for Persistent Web IDentifiers to web material in web archives using the 'pwid' namespace identifier. The purpose of the standard is to support general, global, sustainable, humanly readable, technology agnostic, persistent and precise web references for web materials in web archives in a way that can make them potentially resolvable. The PWID URN can assist in two ways: First, by providing potential resolvable precise and persistent reference scheme for web archive materials, which is not sufficiently covered by existing web reference practices and new suggested referencing methods. Second, to specify web elements in web collections (also known as web corpus) even for collections where there are references to web elements in several archives.</t>
