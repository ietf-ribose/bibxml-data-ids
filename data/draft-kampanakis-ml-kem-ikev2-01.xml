    <abstract>
      <t>[EDNOTE: The intention of this draft is to get IANA KE codepoints for ML-KEM. It could be a standards track draft given that ML-KEM will see a lot of adoption, an AD sponsored draft, or even an individual stable draft which gets codepoints from Expert Review. The approach is to be decided by the IPSECME WG. ] NIST recently standardized ML-KEM, a new key encapsulation mechanism, which can be used for quantum-resistant key establishment. This draft specifies how to use ML-KEM as an additionall key exchange mechanism in IKEv2 along with traditional (Elliptic Curve) Diffie- Hellman. This hybrid approach allows for negotiating IKE and Child SA keys which are safe against cryptanalytically-relevant quantum computers and theoretical weaknesses in ML-KEM as it is relatively new.</t>
