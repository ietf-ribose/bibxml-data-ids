    <abstract>
      <t>Recently, a number of problems related to RTP scalability to large multicast groups have been identified. The main problem, congestion of RTCP packets due to near-simultaneous joins, has been resolved in previous work. In this document, we present some additional problems and describe the solutions. In particular, we discuss the problem of BYE floods and premature timeouts. To resolve the BYE flood problem, we propose a BYE reconsideration mechanism. To help alleviate prema- ture timeouts, we propose a reverse timer reconsideration algorithm. Both algorithms are simple, and require minimal state and computa- tion.</t>
