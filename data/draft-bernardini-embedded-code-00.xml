      <t>Some RFC need to include some code or some kind of data like test vectors. Extracting the code or the data from the RFC "by hand" is possible, but tiresome and prone to errors, especially if the portion to be extracted is long or comprises many files. This document describes a format that can be used to embed code or data in an RFC, so that it can be extract by a software, while preserving the readibility of the embedded text.</t>
