      <t>This document describes a proposal which deals with congestion conditions that may arise when a home or SME customer requests too many simultaneous flows to be forwarded down a DSL link or other access technology. It provides a solution to guaranteeing certain flows while making others (typically the latest or another flow selected for policy reasons) the subject of focused packet discards. It has a number of significant benefits over other possible solutions, such as classical RSVP, and these are also listed in the document.</t>
