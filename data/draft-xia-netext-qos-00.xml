      <t>This document describes Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning in aProxy Mobile IPv6 domain through enabling differentiated services.When a packet is encapsulated in a mobile access gateway (or a localmobility anchor), the differentiated services codepoint (DSCP) fieldin the outer header is mapped to the priority of a mobile node, orthe precedence of an application of the mobile node. Intermediaryrouters between the mobile access gateway and the local mobilityanchor, which forward the packet based on the outer header of thepacket, prioritize the packet according to the DSCP value of theouter header.</t>
