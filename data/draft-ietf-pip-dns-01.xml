      <t>Pip is an internet protocol intended as the replacement for IP version 4. Pip is a general purpose internet protocol, designed to handle all forseeable internet protocol requirements. This specification describes the use of DNS to support Pip. Because Pip carries IDs and addresses separately, and because Pip Addresses are variable length, DNS must be modified to support Pip. Also, Pip addresses are more likely to change than IP addresses. To enable DNS to still cache aggressively in the presence of address changes, we propose adding functionality to DNS to allow resolvers to ask for later versions of information when previously returned information is found to be out-of-date. In addition to these necessary modifications, we have chosen to add new information to DNS to support transition and to support Pip features, such as policy routing, mobile hosts and routing through Public Data Networks. Later multicast support will be added as well.</t>
