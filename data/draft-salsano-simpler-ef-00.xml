      <t>This document proposes text aiming at providing clarification to RFC 2598. As explained in [CHA], the primary motivation is that the definition of EF PHB given in RFC 2598 does not match the intuition of the EF PHB, and has been determined to be unimplementable in a manner compliant with the definition. [CHA] gives a new rigorous definition of EF PHB, using a recurrence equation that determines a bound for time at the which a packet must exit the node, given that the arriving times and the exit times of all packets are recorded.</t>
