      <t>This document proposes text aiming at providing clarification to RFC2598. As explained in [CHA], the primary motivation is that thedefinition of EF PHB given in RFC 2598 does not match the intuitionof the EF PHB, and has been determined to be unimplementable in amanner compliant with the definition.[CHA] gives a new rigorous definition of EF PHB, using a recurrenceequation that determines a bound for time at the which a packet mustexit the node, given that the arriving times and the exit times ofall packets are recorded.</t>
