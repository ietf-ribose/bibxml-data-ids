      <t>This document recommends that network implementors who have planned or deployed an OSI NSAP addressing plan, and who wish to deploy or transition to IP6, should redesign a native IP6 addressing plan to meet their needs. However, in the event that network implementors prefer to keep their OSI addressing plan intact, this document defines a mapping of OSI NSAP addresses into IP6 addresses. This mapping is restricted by the 16 byte size of IP6 addresses. This document also defines a mapping of IP6 addresses within the OSI address format, should this be required for any reason.</t>
