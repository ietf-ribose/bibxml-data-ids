      <t>This document presents the routing requirements for in-vehicle lowpower and lossy networks. Automobiles are already equipped withseveral sensors and devices named Electronic Control Unit (ECU) forcontrolling, monitoring and entertainment, etc. For the future in-vehicle networks, the shift to wireless is desirable due to heavyweight and volume of cables in vehicles and to be able to efficientlyinstall devices. However, with the limitation of low power, in-vehicle network still requires reliability and scalability in natureof the rolls of ECU. The routing protocol should support thefeatures of low-power, high-reliability, Subnetting, QoS, Mobility,etc. This document briefly explains the in-vehicle networks andECUs, then discusses the requirements for the future wireless in-vehicle networks.</t>
