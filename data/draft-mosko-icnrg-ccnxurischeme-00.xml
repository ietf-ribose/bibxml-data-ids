      <t>This document defines an RFC3986 URI compliant identifier called a Labeled Segment URI in which name segments carry a label. This allows differentiation between unrelated resources with similar identifiers. This document also specifies the CCNx URI scheme, called "ccnx:," which conforms to the labeled segment encoding rules presented here. The CCNx URI scheme applies specific labels to each name segment of a URI to disambiguate between resources with similar names. This document defines a specific set of segment labels with label semantics.</t>
