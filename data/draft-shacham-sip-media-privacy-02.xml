      <t>Recording of a conversation presents a possible breach of privacy. This document presents a use of the SIP Preconditions Framework to negotiate the recording guidelines for the session. One party may assert either their desire to record or their restriction of the other party's recording. In order to establish the session, the other party must respond that it agrees to the conditions. While this does not have the power to limit the physical recording by the user on the end system, it provides evidence of the expressed wishes of one party and the agreement of the other.</t>
