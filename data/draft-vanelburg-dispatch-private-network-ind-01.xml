      <t>This document specifies the SIP P-Private-Network-Indication P-header. The use of this private network indication extension is only applicable inside an administrative domain with previously agreed-upon policies for generation, transport and usage of such information. A private network indication allows nodes in such a domain to treat private network traffic according to a different set of rules than the set applicable to public network traffic. The indication also distinguishes traffic from one private network from another private network.</t>
