      <t>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is used to deliver real-timecontent and, along with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP), forms thecontrol channel between the sender and receiver. However, RTP andRTCP assume a single delivery path between the sender and receiverand make decisions based on the measured characteristics of thissingle path. Increasingly, endpoints are becoming multi-homed, whichmeans that they are connected via multiple Internet paths. Networkutilization can be improved when endpoints use multiple parallelpaths for communication. The resulting increase in reliability andthroughput can also enhance the user experience. This documentextends the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) so that a singlesession can take advantage of the availability of multiple pathsbetween two endpoints.</t>
