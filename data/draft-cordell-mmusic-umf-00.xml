      <t>A number of methods and tools are available for defining the formatof messages used for signalling protocols. However, many of thesemethods and tools have been designed for purposes other than messagedefinition, and have been adopted on the basis that they are readilyavailable rather than being ideally suited to the task. This oftenmeans that the methods make it difficult to get definitions correct,or result in unnecessary verbosity both in the definition and on thewire.UMF - the Universal Message Format - has been custom designed for thepurpose of message definition. It is thus easy to specify messagesin a compact, extensible format that is readily machine manipulatedto produce a compact encoding on the wire.</t>
