    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a solution to the problem of finding information about that services are being offered at a particular Internet domain, based on deployment experience with the Netfind White Pages directory software. This approach makes it possible to supply clients with more information than the DNS aliases that have been widely deployed in this role - notably the port numbers being used by servers. However, it is not without problems, and we have tried to take account of these.</t>
