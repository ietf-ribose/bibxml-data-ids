      <t>In recent years, embedded computing devices have increasingly been provided with Internet interfaces, and the typically-weak network security of such devices has become a challenge for the Internet infrastructure. This document lists a number of minimum requirements that vendors of Internet of Things (IoT) devices need to take into account during development and when producing firmware updates, in order to reduce the frequency and severity of security incidents in which such devices are implicated.</t>
