    <abstract>
      <t>The CLUE framework document defines the concept of media captures which identify and describe the characteristics of media sent by a provider. A capture scene is a grouping concept that provides ties a number of captures together. Within the capture scene the media captures may further be grouped into capture scene entries. The current text in the CLUE framework document describing these concepts could be improved and clarified so that both providers and consumers use the same logic to encode/decode CLUE messages with capture scenes/ capture scene entries and media captures. This draft discusses these concepts and provides suggested updates.</t>
