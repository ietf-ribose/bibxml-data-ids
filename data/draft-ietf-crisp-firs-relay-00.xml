      <t>This document describes an LDAP search request and response control to allow additional unspecified data to be returned with a referral to the client, which can submit these data to the referred to server in support of the Federated Internet Registry Service (FIRS) described in [FIRS-ARCH] and [FIRS-CORE]. A flexible container called relay bag as required in [CRISP-REQ] is included into this extension to the LDAP search operation.</t>
