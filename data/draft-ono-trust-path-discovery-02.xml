      <t>Chained or transitive trust can be used to determine whether incomingcommunication is likely to be desirable or not. We can build achained trust relationship by introducing friends to our friends, forexample. We propose mechanisms for discovering trust paths andbinary responsive trustworthiness. The trust paths are based on achain of trust relationships between users, a user and a domain, anddomains. We apply this model to establishing relatively low-valuetrust suitable for deciding whether to accept communication requestssuch as emails, calls, or instant messages from strangers.</t>
