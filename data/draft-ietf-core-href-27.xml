      <t>The Constrained Resource Identifier (CRI) is a complement to the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that represents the URI components in Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) rather than as a sequence of characters. This approach simplifies parsing, comparison, and reference resolution in environments with severe limitations on processing power, code size, and memory size. This RFC updates RFC 7595 by adding a column on the "URI Schemes" registry as well as a note on how that registry cooperates with the "CRI Scheme Numbers for Certain Unregistered Scheme Names" registry created by the present RFC. // (This "cref" paragraph will be removed by the RFC editor:) The // present revision -27 is a fixup to revision -26, which was missing // the fixes for Éric Vyncke's COMMENTs. This is now intended to be // ready for document approval.</t>
