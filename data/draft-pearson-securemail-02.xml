      <t>This document provides an Applicability Statement for Securemail, a framework proposal for secure transmission and better authentication of email based on current Internet standards. The SecureMail framework proposes the use of Transaction Layer Security (TLS), the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and Sender ID to support secure email communication between internet servers with some assurance of the authenticity of the message sender. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the mailing list at securemail-discuss@googlegroups.com and/or the authors.</t>
