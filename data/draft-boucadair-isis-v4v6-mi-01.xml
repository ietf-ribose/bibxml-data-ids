      <t>This memo defines two new Instance Identifiers (Instance IDs) in IS-IS [RFC1195]). These new Instance IDs [I-D.ietf-isis-mi] are meant to instantiate distinct IS-IS instances to convey routing information which is restricted to IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format]. The ultimate goal of running separate instances for IPv4-mapped IPv6 routes is to isolate the IPv6 routing table from the IPv4 routing table, and to avoid any overload due to the population of the table by IPv4-mapped IPv6 routes. This isolation is motivated also from an operational perspective to allow the enforcement of specific routing policies for each topology.</t>
