    <abstract>
      <t>This draft describes a method for improving the quality of experience (QoE) for real-time video and other multimedia services using features and functions of the end-point only, that is, without requiring any upgrade to the network transport infrastructure. Any upgrade to the network transport infrastructure not only incurs significant costs, these are also time consuming and technology- dependent. Therefore, these QoE improvement mechanisms are significantly more attractive to both network operators and service providers.</t>
