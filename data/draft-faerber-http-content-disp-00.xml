      <t>[RFC2183] introduces a Content-Disposition header field for Internet Mail Messages to transmit presentation information as well as a suggested file name for saving the content to disk and the file's date information. All of this information is missing from HTTP entities [RFC2068]. However, there is nothing that would prevent the use of the Content- Disposition header with this HTTP. Without being standard, the Content-Disposition header has already been introduced by some software products. [HTTP1.1-REV] documents this practice, based on [RFC1806]. This memo also extends the specification to cover [RFC2183] and corrects the common abuse of the Content-Type header to cover presentation information.</t>
