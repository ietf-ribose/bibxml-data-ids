      <t>DNS zone administrators occasionally need to update data published by a parent zone, such as NS and DS records. Traditionally these updates have happened out-of-band: through DNS registrar interfaces, EPP, websites, or manually by operators. Some updates could also be done using DNS Dynamic Update [RFC2136]. The IETF's DNSOP working group is considering proposing additional mechanisms for such updates, possibly leveraging DNSSEC for authentication. This document presents some use cases to drive this design work.</t>
