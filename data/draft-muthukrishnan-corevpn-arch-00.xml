      <t>This draft presents an approach for building core VPN services in the service provider backbone, as described in [Heinanen]. This approach does not depend on MPLS running in the backbone but will benefit from it. The central vision is for the service provider to provide a virtual router service to their customers. Ease of configuration, dynamic neighbor discovery, scaling and the use of existing routing protocols as they exist today without any modifications are the keystones of this architecture.</t>
