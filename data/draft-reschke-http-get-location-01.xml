      <t>Several hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) extensions use methodsother than GET to expose information. This has the drawback thatthis kind of information is harder to identify (missing a URL towhich a GET request could be applied) and to cache.This document specifies a simple extension header through which aserver can advertise a substitute URL that an HTTP clientsubsequently can use with the GET method.</t>
