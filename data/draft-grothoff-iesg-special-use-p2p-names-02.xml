      <t>This is an IESG Approval document requesting the reservation of six Top-Level Domains for special use, in conformance with the registration procedure defined in RFC 6761, section 4. Peer-to-Peer systems use specific decentralized mechanisms to allocate, register, manage, and resolve names. Those mechanisms operate entirely outside of DNS, independently from the DNS root and delegation tree. In order to avoid interoperability issues with DNS as well as to address security and privacy concerns, this document describes six pseudo Top-Level Domain names (pTLDs), reserved for special use. The following six domains relate to security-focused peer-to-peer systems. They are: ".gnu", ".zkey", ".onion", ".exit", ".i2p", and ".bit".</t>
