      <t>TCP's intertwined error and congestion control is not robust againstspurious timeouts nor is it robust against packet re-orderings. Apacket that is delayed in the network beyond the expiration of TCP'sretransmission timer, is mistaken for a packet loss by a TCP sender.Also, a packet that is re-ordered in the network beyond TCP'sduplicate acknowledgment threshold, is eventually mistaken for apacket loss by a TCP sender. Both situations lead to a spuriousretransmit of the oldest outstanding segment, and an unnecessaryreduction of the congestion window at the sender. Moreover, aspurious timeout forces the sender into a go-back-N retransmissionmode leading to spurious retransmits of all outstanding segments.</t>
