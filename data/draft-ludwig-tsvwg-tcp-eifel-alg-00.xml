      <t>TCP's intertwined error and congestion control is not robust against spurious timeouts nor is it robust against packet re-orderings. A packet that is delayed in the network beyond the expiration of TCP's retransmission timer, is mistaken for a packet loss by a TCP sender. Also, a packet that is re-ordered in the network beyond TCP's duplicate acknowledgment threshold, is eventually mistaken for a packet loss by a TCP sender. Both situations lead to a spurious retransmit of the oldest outstanding segment, and an unnecessary reduction of the congestion window at the sender. Moreover, a spurious timeout forces the sender into a go-back-N retransmission mode leading to spurious retransmits of all outstanding segments.</t>
