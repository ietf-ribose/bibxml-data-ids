      <t>While the RTP payload format defined in RFC 2250 is generally applicableto all forms of MPEG audio or video, it is less suitable for MPEG 1 or 2,layer III audio (commonly known as 'MP3'). The reason for this is thatan MP3 frame is not a true 'Application Data Unit' - it contains aback-pointer to data in earlier frames, and so cannot be decodedindependently of these earlier frames. Because RFC 2250 defines that packetboundaries coincide with frame boundaries, it handles packet lossinefficiently when carrying MP3 data. The loss of an MP3 frame will rendersome data in previous (or future) frames useless, even if they are receivedwithout loss. In this document we define a new RTP payload format for MP3 audio. The newformat is essentially the same as that defined in RFC 2250, except for adata-preserving rearrangement of the original MPEG frames, so that packetboundaries now coincide with true MP3 'Application Data Units'. This newformat is therefore more data efficient in the face of packet loss.</t>
