      <t>This draft suggests a standard form for encoding SPKI certificates inXML as opposed to the original s-expression encoding defined in[SPKI]. The standard form is defined as an XML document typedefinition (DTD). The main emphasis is on the XML-encoding of anauthorization certificate that is the basic SPKI certificate form.This draft provides also a brief introduction to XML and a shortdiscussion about the benefits of choosing XML as the certificateencoding format.In addition, this draft discusses the problems of automaticprocessing of tags (attributes and authorizations transferred by acertificate are called tags in SPKI) when reducing certificates. Anexample of encoding Java permissions in an SPKI certificate is givento demonstrate the problem and, finally, a solution to this problemis suggested.</t>
