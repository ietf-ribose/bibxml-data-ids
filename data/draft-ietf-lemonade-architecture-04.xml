      <t>This document specifies the architecture for mobile email, as described by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), using Internet Mail protocols. This architecture was an important consideration for much of the work of the LEMONADE (Enhancements to Internet email to Support Diverse Service Environments) working group in the IETF. This document also describes how the LEMONADE architecture meets OMA's requirements for their Mobile Email (MEM) service. This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t>
