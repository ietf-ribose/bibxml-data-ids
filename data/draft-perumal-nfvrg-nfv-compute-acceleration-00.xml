      <t>Network functions are being virtualized and moved to industry standard servers. Steady growth of traffic volume requires more compute power to process the network functions. Network packet based architecture provides a lot of scope for parallel processing. Generic parallel processing can be done in common multicore platforms like GPUs, coprocessors like Intel Xeon Phi[6][7] and Intel[7]/AMD[10] multicore CPUs. In this draft to check the feasibility and to exploit this parallel processing capability, multi string matching is taken as the sample network function for URL filtering. Aho-Corasick algorithm has been made use for multi pattern matching. Implementation utilizes OpenCL [3] to support many common platforms[7][10][11]. A list of optimizations is done, the application is tested on Nvidia Tesla K10 GPUs. A common API for NFV Compute Acceleration has been proposed.</t>
