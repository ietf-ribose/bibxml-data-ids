      <t>[I-D.zzhang-dmm-5g-distributed-upf] describes evolution of mobile user plane in 5G, including distributed UPFs and alternative user plane implementations that some vendors/operators are pushing without changing 3GPP architecture/signaling. Building on top of that, this document further discusses potentially integrating UPF and Acess Node (AN) in a future generation (xG) of mobile network. This document is not an attempt to do 3GPP work in IETF. Rather, it discusses potential integration of IETF/wireline and 3GPP/wireless technologies - first among parties who are familiar with both areas and friendly with IETF/wireline technologies. If the ideas in this document are deemed reasonable, feasible and desired among these parties, they can then be brought to 3GPP for further discussions.</t>
