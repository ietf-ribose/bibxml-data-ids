      <t>This paper Defines the 'IPtX Protocol Specification', and provides a visualization of the lack of IP Address Control, a Blunder, which may be excused partly because of the impossibility of Predicting the Current, as well as the Future use and growth of the Internet. However, this requires an investigation, or Analysis for the Current use of the HD-Ratio in the IPv4 and IPv6 IP Specifications. Moreover, while the IPv4 IP Specification, is indeed the primary focus of this investigation. To provide a fair comparison however, this Analysis requires, if not mandates, the use of the IPt1 and IPt2 specifications as well. The reasoning here nevertheless, is the difference in the respective Addressing Schematics. Where by, the Addressing Scheme of the former focuses primarily on the HOST IP Address (Assignment), while the focus of the latter emphasizes only the Network IP Address. Nevertheless,it shall be concluded, the Addressing Methods used in the Schematic also affects the Efficiency; 'the RATIO of Total Number of Nodes that can be attached to Service the Global Networking Community, and the Number of available IP Addresses used for the Connection'. In other words, this 'Analysis is Argument', whose focus upon the 'HD-Ratio' and the 'CIDR Notation' establishes the foundation defining the 'INTERNET PROTOCOL t1 and t2 ADDRESS SPACE' for the IPt1 and IPt2 Protocol Specifications. Which moreover, exceeds the Mandate Defining a New IP Addressing System specified as the Requirements outlined in RFC1550.</t>
