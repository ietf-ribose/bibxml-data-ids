    <abstract>
      <t>Documents published in 2013 have revealed several classes of "pervasive" attack on Internet communications. In this document we develop a threat model that describes these pervasive attacks. We start by assuming a completely passive adversary with an interest in indiscriminate eavesdropping that can observe network traffic, then expand the threat model with a set of verified attacks that have been published. Based on this threat model, we discuss the techniques that can be employed in Internet protocol design to increase the protocols robustness to pervasive attacks.</t>
