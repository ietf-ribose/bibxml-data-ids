    <abstract>
      <t>The Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol is implemented by devices called TRILL Switches or RBridges (Routing Bridges). TRILL supports both point-to-point and multi-access links and is designed so that a variety of link protocols can be used between TRILL switch ports. This document standardizes methods for encapsulating TRILL in IP(v4 or v6) to provide a unified TRILL campus.</t>
