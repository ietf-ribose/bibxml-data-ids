      <t>IPv6 deployment is delayed by the existence of millions of subscribernetwork address translators (NATs) that cannot be upgraded to supportIPv6. This document specifies a mechanism for traversal of suchNATs. It is based on an address mapping and on a mechanism wherebysuitably upgraded hosts behind a NAT may obtain IPv6 connectivity viaa stateless server, known as a SAMPLE server, operated by theirInternet Service Provider. SAMPLE is an alternative to the Teredoprotocol.</t>
