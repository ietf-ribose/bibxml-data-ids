      <t>This document introduces analyzes of ECN(Explicit Congestion Notification)in case of congestion of local links. 3GPP adopts and specifies shared channel for multiple user equipments in a cell. Other last mile access systems (e.g. xDSL access and Frame Relay access) have to handle congestion since bandwidth multiplexing is most likely considered for reducing unnecessary cost. Therefore, congestion in access network is to inform user equipments in case of traffic congestion utilizing congestion notification concepts and similar mechanisms. Besides the argument on the congestions of access networks, this document is also to introduce the use case of Conex which might be useful for the potential Conex proposals to notify and address the congestion of wireless access network further.</t>
