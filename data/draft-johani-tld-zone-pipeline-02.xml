    <abstract>
      <t>Today most TLD registries publish DNSSEC signed zones. The sequence of steps from generating the unsigned zone, via DNSSEC signing and various types of verification is referred to as the "zone pipeline". The robustness and correctness of the zone pipeline is of crucial importance and the zone pipeline is one of the most critical parts of the operations of a TLD registry. The goal of this document is to describe the requirements that the.SE Registry choose in preparation for the implementation of a new zone pipeline. The document also describes some of the design consequences that follow from the requirements. Hence this document is intended to work as a guide for understanding the actual implementation, which is planned to be released as open source. TO BE REMOVED: This document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/johanix/draft-johani-tld-zone-pipeline (https://github.com/johanix/draft-johani-tld-zone-pipeline). The most recent working version of the document, open issues, etc. should all be available there. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.</t>
