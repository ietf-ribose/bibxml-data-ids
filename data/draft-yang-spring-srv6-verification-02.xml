    <abstract>
      <t>SRv6 is being rapidly deployed and is currently primarily used in trusted-domain backbone networks. However, we have also observed that SRv6 is beginning to extend toward end-user devices, e.g., in SD-WAN deployments. SD-WAN can be deployed in third-party clouds or at customer sites, causing the physical boundary of SRv6 to become blurred. This introduces certain security risks, such as packet injection and path manipulation attacks. Section 6 of [I-D.draft-ietf-spring-srv6-security] identifies these risks as well, including Section 6.2.1 on Modification Attacks and Section 6.2.3 on Packet Insertion. This proposal mitigates these risks by enhancing the HMAC mechanism defined in [RFC8754].</t>
