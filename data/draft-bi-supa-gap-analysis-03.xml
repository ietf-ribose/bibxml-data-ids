      <t>As operators struggle to optimize their network for different applications while maximizing network resources usage, there's growing business pressure to minimize operational tasks and the deployment time of new services. New automation paradigms are meant to help reach these goals, including the optimization of network functions through application control. This control could be signaled directly by an application, through a proxy or orchestrated in a centralized manner. The purpose of SUPA is to develop a methodology by which network services can be managed using standardized policy rules. SUPA will focus in the first phase on inter-datacenter traffic management as part of the distributed data center use case, including the automated provisioning of site-to-site virtual private networks of various types.This memo analyses the current state of the art of the industries in IETF and outside IETF.</t>
