      <t>The VPWS service [L2VPN Framework] provides point-to-point connections between pairs of Customer Edge (CE) devices. It does so by binding two Attachment Circuits (each connecting a CE device with a Provider Edge, PE, device) to a Pseudowire (connecting the two PEs). In general, the Attachment Circuits must be of the same technology (e.g., both ethernet, both ATM), and the Pseudowire must carry the frames of that technology. However, if it is known that the frames' payload consists solely of IP datagrams, it is possible to provide a point-to-point connection in which the Pseudowire connects Attachment Circuits of different technologies. This requires the PEs to perform a function known as "ARP Mediation". This document specifies the ARP Mediation function, and specifies draft-shah-l2vpn-arp-mediation-00.txt the encapsulation used to carry the IP datagrams on the Pseudowires when ARP mediation is used.</t>
