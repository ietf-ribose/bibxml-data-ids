      <t>This document defines an application protocol for WSDB services provided to TV Band Devices (TVBDs). The protocol complies with FCC Rules/Requirements [FCC 10-174] and in the context of operating an FCC certified database, it also complies with requirements defined by IETF PAWS [IETF-PAWS-03]. We believe this protocol can be easily extended to include the remaining requirements not already satisfied from the IETF PAWS requirements.</t>
