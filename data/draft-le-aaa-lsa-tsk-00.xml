    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a mechanism to set up a Local Security Association (LSA) between a user and the visited network when the user is roaming. It defines all the required related functionalities such as the key generation, distribution and update procedures; it also describes the reasons and the benefits of the adoption of such LSA. The applicability of this draft is mainly for AAA Diameter and for URP (User Registration Protocol), but the mechanism can be adopted more in general in each case where the user (or mobile node) needs to establish a security association with a foreign domain while roaming.</t>
