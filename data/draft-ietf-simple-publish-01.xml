      <t>This document describes an extension to the Session InitiationProtocol (SIP) for publishing event state used within the frameworkfor SIP Event Notification. The first application of this extensionis targeted at the publication of presence information.The mechanism described in this document can be extended to supportpublication of any event state, for which there exists an appropriateevent package. It is not intended to be a general-purpose mechanismfor transport of arbitrary data, as there are better suitedmechanisms for this purpose (FTP, HTTP, etc.)</t>
