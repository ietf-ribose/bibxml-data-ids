      <t>This document reports round-trip delay measurements captured by a single MPLS Path Monitoring System (PMS) compared with results of an IPPM conformant measurement system, consisting of three different Measurement Agents. The measurements were made in a research backbone with an LDP control plane. The packets of the MPLS PMS use label stacks similar to those to be used by a segment routing MPLS PMS. The measurement packets of the MPLS PMS remained in the network data plane.</t>
