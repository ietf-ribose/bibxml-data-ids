    <abstract>
      <t>Redundancy protection provides a mechanism to achieve the high reliability of the service transmission in network. Specifically, packets of flows are replicated into two or more copies, which are transported through different paths in parallel. When copies of packets are merged at network node, the redundant packets are eliminated to guarantee one copy of the flow is successfully transmitted. This document extends the capabilities in SR paradigm to support redundancy protection function, including the definitions of new Segments and a variation of Segment Routing Policy. The new mechanism applies equally to both Segment Routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and Segment Routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</t>
