      <t>This ID will contain the full-length versions of all critiques whichwere not included in full in the RRG Report. It may also point todiscussions I consider significant, and include any "rebuttals" or"reflections" which were not included in full in the Report. This IDis to support and document the IRTF Routing Research Groupdiscussions concerning scalable routing, in early 2010. It is not aformal product of the RRG. To what extent its contents are supportedby RRG consensus can only be determined by the co-chairs.</t>
