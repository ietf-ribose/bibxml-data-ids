      <t>This ID will contain the full-length versions of all critiques which were not included in full in the RRG Report. It may also point to discussions I consider significant, and include any "rebuttals" or "reflections" which were not included in full in the Report. This ID is to support and document the IRTF Routing Research Group discussions concerning scalable routing, in early 2010. It is not a formal product of the RRG. To what extent its contents are supported by RRG consensus can only be determined by the co-chairs.</t>
