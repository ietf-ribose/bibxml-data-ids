      <t>Explicit Multicast (Xcast) is a newly proposed multicast scheme to support a very large number of small multicast groups. Current Xcast specification mentions its data plane only, and does not specify a control plane. Therefore, this document describes an enhanced scheme for the support of receiver initiated join in explicit multicast, named Xcast extension (Xcast+), which complements the existing Xcast.</t>
