    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents one possible new IP routing and adressing architecture. By routing and addressing it is meant that part of the overall IP architecture which is responsible for identifying computing nodes, where they are in the Internet, and how to get traffic from one to another. It represents one person's view of a good overall system answer to this question, and is not to be taken as anything more than that.</t>
