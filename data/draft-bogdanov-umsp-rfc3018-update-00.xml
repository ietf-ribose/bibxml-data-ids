    <abstract>
      <t>UMSP gives the universal environment for integration of any Internet devices in one computing system. UMSP controls the distributed execution of applications at a level of network connections, gives the access to applications memory on remote nodes, and provides the network interaction on basis of the Remote Application Procedure Call. The submitted document is updating of the RFC3018 specification. The difference is the independence of the protocol from the format and the length of network address, the interaction between IPv4 and IPv6 hosts, and the interaction between hosts with public and non-public network addresses.</t>
