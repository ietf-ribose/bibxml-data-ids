      <t>TCP's state mechanics uses a series of well-known messages that are exchanged in the clear. Because these are visible to network elements on the path between the two nodes setting up the transport connection, they are often used as signals by those network elements. In transports that do not exchange these messages in the clear, on- path network elements lack those signals. This document discusses the nature of the signals as they are seen by on-path elements and reflects on best practices for transports which encrypt their state mechanics.</t>
