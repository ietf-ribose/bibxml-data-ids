      <t>WIRE extends HTTP with a new type of redirect response that permits aresolver to explicitly delegate a resolution to other resolvers andprotocols. WIRE is an effort to make delegation more explicit, redirectionmore flexible, and resolution processes more efficient through the use ofhints. This document defines WIRE and describes the expected behaviors ofresolvers and clients using WIRE. WIRE is an extension of the HyperTextTransfer Protocol (HTTP), and is intended to be compatible with HTTP/1.0 andabove [4][5]. WIRE encourages use of long-lived URIs and at the same time supportsprotocol evolution without having to change currently deployed URIs or URIschemes. The extension is based on a simple URI resolution model that allowsan application to dynamically request metadata describing where and how toaccess a resource. The model can use any generic metadata descriptionlanguage (e.g. RDF) and as the metadata itself is interpreted as a firstclass resource, metadata resources are no different than any other resourceon the Web.</t>
