      <t>WIRE extends HTTP with a new type of redirect response that permits a resolver to explicitly delegate a resolution to other resolvers and protocols. WIRE is an effort to make delegation more explicit, redirection more flexible, and resolution processes more efficient through the use of hints. This document defines WIRE and describes the expected behaviors of resolvers and clients using WIRE. WIRE is an extension of the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and is intended to be compatible with HTTP/1.0 and above [4][5]. WIRE encourages use of long-lived URIs and at the same time supports protocol evolution without having to change currently deployed URIs or URI schemes. The extension is based on a simple URI resolution model that allows an application to dynamically request metadata describing where and how to access a resource. The model can use any generic metadata description language (e.g. RDF) and as the metadata itself is interpreted as a first class resource, metadata resources are no different than any other resource on the Web.</t>
