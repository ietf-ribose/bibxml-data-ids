      <t>This document briefly outlines current approaches to indexing and searching, proposes some experimental mechanisms which might be deployed within HTTP [1] in support of these activities, and concludes with a discussion of the issues raised. The key features which are seen as desirable are a standardized way of providing a local search capability on the information being made available by an HTTP server, and a way of reducing both the bandwidth consumed by indexing agents and the amount of work done by HTTP servers during the indexing process.</t>
