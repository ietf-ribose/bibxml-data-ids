      <t>This memo defines a MIME Content-Type and for holding arbitrary item information. The definition is independent of any particular item type or application. The application/properties Content-Type is defined for holding a variety of basic textual property information to describe the item, for example a directory item could contain name, and email address. The application/properties Content-Type can also be used as the root body part in a multipart/related Content-Type for handling more complicated situations in which non-textual information, for example an image or sound, must be represented. The application/properties Content-Type defines a general framework and format for holding directory information in a 'name, datatype: value' format. This document also defines the procedure by which particular formats for carrying the application-specific information within an application/properties Content-Type may be defined and registered, and the conventions such formats must follow. It is expected that other documents will be produced that define such formats for various application item types (e.g. white pages, appointments).</t>
