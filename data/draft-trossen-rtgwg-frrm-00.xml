    <abstract>
      <t>This document introduces a communication semantic for multicast that is initiated through forward requests, resulting in dynamic return multicast to the set of initiating clients. The key dynamic nature here is the return multicast relations being possibly different for every transmission. We introduce this semantic more formally, present exemplifying use cases and then focus on realizing this semantic using two multicast technologies. Although this document formally introduces the FRRM semantic as a new communication semantic, it does not intend to show the realization of it through the specific multicast technologies in all details. This is left for separate documents, if desired.</t>
