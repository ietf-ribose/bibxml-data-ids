      <t>This Internet draft describes a number of applications that requireaccurate time and/or frequency, and elucidates difficulties relatedto the transfer of high quality time and frequency across an IP orMPLS Packet Switched Network. This issue is not addressed by anycurrently chartered IETF working group, and we therefore propose theformation of a new working group to be called Transmitting Timingover IP Connections and Transfer of Clock (TICTOC).</t>
