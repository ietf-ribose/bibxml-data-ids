      <t>This Internet draft describes a number of applications that require accurate time and/or frequency, and elucidates difficulties related to the transfer of high quality time and frequency across an IP or MPLS Packet Switched Network. This issue is not addressed by any currently chartered IETF working group, and we therefore propose the formation of a new working group to be called Transmitting Timing over IP Connections and Transfer of Clock (TICTOC).</t>
