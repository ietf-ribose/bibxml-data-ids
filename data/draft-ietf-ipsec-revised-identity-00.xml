      <t>There is an opportunity in successor-to-IKE to fix two major problems that have plagued IKEv1: a misunderstanding about what is identity, and having to send certificates every time because you don't know if the other party already has your certificate. This proposal covers both topics at once because it turns out that they are related.</t>
