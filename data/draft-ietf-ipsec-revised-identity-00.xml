      <t>There is an opportunity in successor-to-IKE to fix two major problemsthat have plagued IKEv1: a misunderstanding about what is identity, andhaving to send certificates every time because you don't know if theother party already has your certificate. This proposal covers bothtopics at once because it turns out that they are related.</t>
