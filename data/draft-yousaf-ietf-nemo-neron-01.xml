      <t>IETF has proposed MIPv6 based Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Support protocol that handles the mobility management of IPv6 based mobile networks. However the NEMO protocol has severe performance limitations and does not specify the route optimization method for mobile networks and does not take into account the operational and functional complexities involving nested mobile networks. In this draft we present NEst Route Optimization for NEMO (NERON) protocol, a light weight, efficient and scalable approach that aims at enabling nodes behind nested mobile networks to use optimized communication paths with zero tunneling overhead and minimum end-to- end delay, irrespective of the depth of the nest, with minimum but manageable changes to the base MIPv6 and IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocols and without introducing any new network entities.</t>
