      <t>OAM and PM information from the SR endpoints can be piggybacked in the data packet. The OAM and PM information piggybacking in the data packets is also known as In-situ OAM (IOAM). IOAM records OAM information within the packet while the packet traverses a particular network domain. The term "in-situ" refers to the fact that the IOAM data fields are added to the data packets rather than being sent within probe packets specifically dedicated to OAM. This document defines the data fields encapsulation model of IOAM TLV in SRv6 network.</t>
