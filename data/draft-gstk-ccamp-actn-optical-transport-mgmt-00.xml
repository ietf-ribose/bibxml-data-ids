    <abstract>
      <t>Many network technologies are operated as Traffic Engineered (TE) networks. Optical networks are a particular TE example, with many technology-specific details. Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) is a management architecture that abstracts TE network resources to provide a limited network view for customers to request and self-manage connectivity services. It also provides functional components to orchestrate and operate the network. However, ACTN does not include consideration of Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, and Security aspects of management (known as FCAPS). Nevertheless, FCAPS forms a critical part of service assurance for network operations. This document introduces FCAPS into the ACTN architecture as applied to optical networks. It considers what elements of existing IETF YANG work can be used and what new work is needed.</t>
