      <t>Real time systems often run into the problems where the network bandwidth for logging is shared with the real time media and impacts the media quality. There is a desire to transport the logging data at an appropriate priority level over the same transport as the media. This allows the logging data to take advantage of times when the media bitrate is below the peak rate while not impacting the peak rate available for media. This document specifies how to send syslog RFC5424 type information over the Media Over QUIC Transport (MOQT) [I-D.ietf-moq-transport].</t>
