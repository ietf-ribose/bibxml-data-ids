      <t>This document describes a Simple Extended Area Network (SEAN) architecture to offer comprehensive services as part of a Full Service Network (FSN) by service providers. The motivation for this document is that today's networks are far too complicated to design, deploy and operate, and incurs network overhead and inefficiencies that would soon drive up the costs and the rates to consumers. This cost and complexity situation is also a barrier to deploy advanced and useful network services that offer audio-visual communications. There are technologies like XDSL available today that can simplify network implementations and operations and at the same time provide the bandwidth and other capabilities that allows migration to a simpler network architecture in the future. This document describes the current problems that thwart progress and offers a solution based on XDSL technology to overcome or avoid unnecessary complexities and limitations. This document does not specify an Internet Standard of any kind. It is presented for discussion purpose only.</t>
