      <t>The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) protocol supports creation and management of identity resources such as users between a client and a service provider. In some instances, a SCIM service provider may maintain a list of DNS domains that an organization using that service has registered for their exclusive use with the service. This registration of domains is frequently tied to some form of ownership verification for each domain. This document defines an extension to the SCIM protocol introducing a new 'VerifiedDomains' resource type in order to allow a SCIM client to confirm what domains have had ownership verified by the SCIM service provider, as well as some information about whether the User resource's userName and emails attributes require domain verification in order for a value to possess that domain suffix.</t>
