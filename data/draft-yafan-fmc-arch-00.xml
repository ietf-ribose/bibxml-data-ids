      <t>This document describes an architecture framework for achievingconverged mobile services across alternative radio access networks(GAN, or Generic Access Network), such as WLAN, WiMax, and thecellular network, while utilizing SIP for media session controlbetween the dual mode handset (DMH) and a network SIP proxy. The keybenefits of this architecture include (1) fast and flexible servicedeployment in the IP domain, and (2) allow seamless voice callcontinuity services across IP and circuit-switched cellular domains.</t>
