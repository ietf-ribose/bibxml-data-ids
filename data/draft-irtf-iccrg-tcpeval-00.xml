      <t>This document presents an evaluation test suite for the initial assess-ment of proposed TCP modifications. The goal of the test suite is toallow researchers to quickly and easily evaluate their proposed TCPextensions in simulators and testbeds using a common set of well-defined, standard test cases, in order to compare and contrast proposalsagainst standard TCP as well as other proposed modifications. This testsuite is not intended to result in an exhaustive evaluation of a pro-posed TCP modification or new congestion control mechanism. Instead, thefocus is on quickly and easily generating an initial evaluation reportthat allows the networking community to understand and discuss thebehavioral aspects of a new proposal, in order to guide further experi-mentation that will be needed to fully investigate the specific aspectsof a new proposal.</t>
