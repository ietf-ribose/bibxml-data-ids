      <t>This draft proposes a new packet primitive called Notification for CCN. Notification is a PUSH primitive and can be unicast or multicast to multiple listening points. Notifications do not expect a Content Object response hence only requires the use of FIB state in the CCN forwarder. Emulating Notification as a PULL has performance and routing implications. The draft proposes a new fixed header primitive called Notification and a CCN message encoding using Content Object primitive to transport Notifications. These discussions are presented in the context of CCNx1.0 [1] proposal. The draft also provides discussions on various aspects related to notification such as flow and congestion control, routing and reliability considerations, and use case scenarios.</t>
