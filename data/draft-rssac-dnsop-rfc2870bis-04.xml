      <t>As the Internet has become critical to the world's social and economic infrastructure, attention has focused on the correct, safe, reliable, and secure operation of the Internet infrastructure itself. The DNS is considered a crucial part of that technical infrastructure. The root domain and its authoritative name servers are a part of that technical infrastructure. The primary focus of this document is to provide guidelines for secure, stable, and resilient authoritative name service for the root zone. Additionally it will look into some specifics for the operation of the name servers. Other operators of authoritative name servers such as those for generic top-level domains (gTLDs), country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) and other zones may also find this document useful.</t>
