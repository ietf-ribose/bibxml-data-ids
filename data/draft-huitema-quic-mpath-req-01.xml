      <t>This document describes the requirement and plausible architecture of QUIC multipath extensions. While the first version of QUIC is not scheduled to include multipath extensions, there are risks that decisions made in this first version might preclude some options that we may later find attractive. An early review of multipath extension requirements and issues should minimize that risk.</t>
