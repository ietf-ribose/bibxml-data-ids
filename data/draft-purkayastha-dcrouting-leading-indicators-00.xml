    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a few use cases to illustrate the expectations on today's network. Based on those expectations, it describes how the network architecture and network requirements are changing. The new requirements are impacting data center architecture. The way data centers are evolving, such as central data centers to smaller data centers, a single deployment to multiple deployments, is described. With this new data center model, areas such as routing inside the data center and outside the data center is impacted. The document describes this impact and summarizes few features for these new data center model.</t>
