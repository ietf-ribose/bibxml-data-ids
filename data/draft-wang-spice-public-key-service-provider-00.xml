    <abstract>
      <t>SPICE provides a selective disclosure mechanism of credentials from issuer. However, future network services may be built on the trust between multiple entities. Obtaining the public key of multiple issuers for a verifer from potential multiple sources can be complex. In this contribution, an optional public key service is proposed in SPICE architecture for the issue of obtaining the public keys of the issuers from multiple trusted entities. The basic function of public key service is proposed including public key registration, token verification, and a potential implementation such as the distributed ledger. We hope that the proposed contribution can be used as infomative for SPICE regarding to the token validation procedure.</t>
