    <abstract>
      <t>The procedures in BGP Route Reflection (RR) spec [RFC4456] primarily deal with scenarios where the RR is not in forwarding path, and is reflecting BGP routes with next hop unchanged. These procedures can sometimes result in traffic forwarding loops in deployments where the RR is in forwarding path, and is reflecting BGP routes with next hop set to self. This document specifies approaches to minimize possiblity of such traffic forwarding loops. One of those approaches updates path selection procedures specified in Section 9 of BGP RR. [RFC4456]</t>
