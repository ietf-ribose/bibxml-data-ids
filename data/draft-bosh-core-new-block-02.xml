      <t>This document specifies new Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Block-Wise transfer options: Block3 and Block4 Options. These options are similar to the CoAP Block1 and Block2 Options, but enable faster transmission rates for large amounts of data with less packet interchanges as well as supporting faster recovery should any of the blocks get lost in transmission.</t>
