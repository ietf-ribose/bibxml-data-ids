      <t>A darknet is a set of routable but unused IP addresses whose monitoring is an effective way of detecting malicious activities on the Internet. We have developed an alert system - called DAEDALUS - based-on a large-scale distributed darknet that consists of several organizations that mutually observe the malicious packets transmitted from the inside of the organizations. This draft shares the schema of an alert of the DAEDALUS to exchange incident information among organizations.</t>
