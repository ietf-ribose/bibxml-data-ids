      <t>Protocol mechanisms for fast mobile multicast in IPv6 based on multicastlistening context transfer are proposed. The focus is the context transfer for mobile multicast listeners usingMulticast Listener Discovery protocol Version 2 (MLDv2).Multicast context transfer block and operational considerations foroptimised multicast context transfer based on Fast Handovers for MobileIPv6 and Candidate Access Router Discovery are described. The requirements for MLDv2 context extension and operation at accessrouters to support multicast context transfer for mobile IPv6 arespecified. Interactions of MLDv2 with Protocol Independent Multicast Sparse Mode(PIM-SM) for multicast routing state update based on multicastlistening context transfer are overviewed.Operational considerations for MLDv2 and PIM-SM to support multicastreceiver and source mobility based on context transfer are discussed.Comparison with other multicast protocol proposals for Mobile IPv6(MIPv6) is given.</t>
