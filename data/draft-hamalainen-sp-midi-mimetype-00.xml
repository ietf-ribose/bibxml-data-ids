    <abstract>
      <t>MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA) and Association of Music Electronics industry (AMEI) have recently produced the Scalable Polyphony MIDI (SP-MIDI) standard [1]. The SP-MIDI standard has been developed in particularly for mobile MIDI applications. SP-MIDI has been approved for 3GPP standardization and a dedicated SP-MIDI profile has been defined for 3GPP SP-MIDI devices [2]. Since MIDI information is a very compact media type 3GPP is initially focusing on the application of SP-MIDI for music downloading and messaging applications that require MIME registration.</t>
