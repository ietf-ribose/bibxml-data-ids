    <abstract>
      <t>In data-center networks it is common to use Clos network topologies [clos] in order to provide a non-blocking switched network. In these topologies it is often not desirable to provide native IP multicast service. This document defines a multicast replication algorithm along with its control and data forwarding procedures that provides a multicast service for a BGP IP VPN network without assuming that the underlying infrastructure supports IP multicast.</t>
