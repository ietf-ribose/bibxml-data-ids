      <t>E6Translate (E6T) is a protocol designed to address the challenges of bidirectional communication between IPv4-only hosts and the IPv6 Internet. Leveraging the reserved Class E IPv4 address space (240.0.0.0/4) as temporary placeholders for IPv6 destinations, E6T provides a lightweight and scalable mechanism for IPv4-to-IPv6 mapping and vice versa. To enable reverse connectivity, E6T repurposes a /96 segment of a /64 IPv6 prefix for IPv4-equivalent mapping, facilitating port forwarding and external access to legacy devices. This document outlines the design, operation, and practical applications of E6T, along with considerations for security, deployment, and protocol standardization.</t>
