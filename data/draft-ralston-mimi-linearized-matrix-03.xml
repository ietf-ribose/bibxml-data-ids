    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies Linearized Matrix (LM). LM is an extensible protocol for interoperability between messaging providers, using Matrix's (matrix.org (https://matrix.org)) decentralized room model. LM simplifies the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) persistence of Matrix while maintaining compatibility with non-linearized servers within a room. It does this by using a doubly-linked list of events/messages per room with hub and spoke fanout. LM's extensibility enables a wide range of transport protocol and end-to-end encryption possibilities. This document uses Matrix's room access control semantics supported by Messaging Layer Security (MLS), transported via HTTPS and JSON. The details of which server- to-server transport to use and what a is put over MLS are replaceable. The threat model of LM does not place trust in a central owning server for each conversation. Instead, it defines a hub server which handles maintaining linearized room history for other servers in the room. This model permits transparent interconnection between LM servers and Matrix servers, in the same room.</t>
