      <t>This document describes a self-managed network identifying network problems during failures and repairing them. Self-managed Network Element (sNE) architectures and Network Management System (sNMS) architectures for centrally and distributedly managed networks are described. A hierarchy among repairing entities is defined. An in- band message format for Metro Ethernet networks is proposed for the fault management communication.</t>
