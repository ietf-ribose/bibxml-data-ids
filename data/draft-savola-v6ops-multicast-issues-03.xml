      <t>There are many issues concerning the deployment and implementation,and to a lesser degree, specification of IPv6 multicast. This memodescribes known problems, trying to raise awareness. Currently,global IPv6 interdomain multicast is completely impossible exceptusing SSM: there is no way to convey information about multicastsources between PIM RPs. Site-scoped multicast is also problematicwhen used alongside to global multicast because of that. A fewpossible solutions are outlined or referred to. In addition, anissue regarding link-local multicast-blocking Ethernet switches isbrought up. Finally, a feature request for MLD snooping switches isnoted.</t>
