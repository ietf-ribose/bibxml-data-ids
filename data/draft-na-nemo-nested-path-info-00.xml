      <t>This document addresses how to securely achieve the nested tunnels optimization using nested path information that reflects the optimized path from Top Level Mobile Router(TLMR) to Mobile Router(MR) in nested mobile networks. The solution is based on Reverse Routing Header(RRH) idea and the concern of security problem in RRH. By carefully taking a look at the simplicity of Routing Header Type 2 routing mechanism and the complexity of Access Router Option(ARO) based solution to get rid of the threat of possible attack for RRH, the proposed solution has been considered to preserve the efficiency of RRH without the lack of security.</t>
