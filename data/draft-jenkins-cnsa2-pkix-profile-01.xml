      <t>This document specifies a profile of X.509 v3 Certificates and X.509 v2 Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for applications that use Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite published by the United States Government. The profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of US National Security Systems that employ such X.509 certificates. US National Security Systems are described in NIST Special Publication 800-59. It is also appropriate for all other US Government systems that process high-value information. The profile is made publicly available for use by developers and operators of these and any other system deployments.</t>
