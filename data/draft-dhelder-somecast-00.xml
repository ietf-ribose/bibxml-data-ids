      <t>Somecast is a multi-point delivery technology that allows a packet to be sent to a set of destinations. Somecast delivery means that the network delivers one copy of a packet to each destination listed in the packet. Somecast can be used in small multi-user sessions, such as multimedia conferences and multiplayer games, or used with endhost multicast for larger sessions. This document describes a possible implementation of somecast in IPv4. Somecast is implemented by using an IPv4 header option that includes a list of up to 9 additional destination addresses. This document also describes how somecast can be incrementally deployed.</t>
