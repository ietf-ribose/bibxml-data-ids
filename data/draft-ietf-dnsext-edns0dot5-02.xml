    <abstract>
      <t>EDNS0 [EDNS0] specifies a general framework for extending the packet format used by the Domain Name System protocols. The framework includes a simple version numbering scheme to allow the parties in a DNS protocol exchange to determine which extension features the other party understands. While having the advantage of simplicity, the version numbering scheme as specified has drawbacks: - It provides no way to deprecate a protocol feature; - It provides no way to deploy experimental protocol features. This note proposes to replace the monolithic version numbering mechanism with a mechanism for listing an explicit set of protocol features that a particular implementation supports. We retain version numbering as a way of abbreviating the feature sets that we expect to see in common use.</t>
