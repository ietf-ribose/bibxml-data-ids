      <t>EDNS0 [EDNS0] specifies a general framework for extending the packetformat used by the Domain Name System protocols. The frameworkincludes a simple version numbering scheme to allow the parties in aDNS protocol exchange to determine which extension features the otherparty understands. While having the advantage of simplicity, theversion numbering scheme as specified has drawbacks:- It provides no way to deprecate a protocol feature;- It provides no way to deploy experimental protocol features.This note proposes to replace the monolithic version numberingmechanism with a mechanism for listing an explicit set of protocolfeatures that a particular implementation supports. We retainversion numbering as a way of abbreviating the feature sets that weexpect to see in common use.</t>
