      <t>This document describes the RTP payload format for Enhanced Variable Rate Codec (EVRC) Speech and Selectable Mode Vocoder (SMV) Speech. Other vocoders which share common characteristics with EVRC and SMV can be easily supported by following the procedures specified in this document. The packet format supports various formats for different application scenarios. A bundled/interleaved format is included to reduce the effect of packet loss on Speech quality. A non-bundled format is also supported for conversational applications.</t>
