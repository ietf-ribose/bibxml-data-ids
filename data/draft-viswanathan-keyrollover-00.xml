      <t>This memo discusses the authentication for routing and management protocols based on preconfigured keys,the need and basis for key rollover, and an mechanism to seamlessly rollover the authentication keys. It is intended for an application where secure administrative access to all the end-points of the protocol connection is normally available. The strategy described herein improves upon the current practice where a key is preconifigured at all endpoints and the key rollover is done manually within a short synchronized window to avoid connection drops due to key mismatch.</t>
