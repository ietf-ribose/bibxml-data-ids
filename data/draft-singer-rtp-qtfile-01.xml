      <t>This document proposes structures within a QuickTime movie file which permit easy transmission of the media content over RTP. This specification is intended to assist those who wish to stream stored movies over RTP, those wishing to prepare movies for streaming, and for those who might wish to record into QuickTime while preserving RTP information. The bit-stream(s) of RTP packets are normally compliant with the RTP payload definitions for their content, and full inter-operability can be achieved. Each QuickTime media track within a movie is sent over a separate RTP session and synchronized using standard RTP techniques. This specification builds on the published QuickTime file format specification.</t>
