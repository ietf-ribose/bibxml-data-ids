      <t>This document proposes structures within a QuickTime movie file whichpermit easy transmission of the media content over RTP. Thisspecification is intended to assist those who wish to stream storedmovies over RTP, those wishing to prepare movies for streaming, andfor those who might wish to record into QuickTime while preservingRTP information. The bit-stream(s) of RTP packets are normallycompliant with the RTP payload definitions for their content, andfull inter-operability can be achieved. Each QuickTime media trackwithin a movie is sent over a separate RTP session and synchronizedusing standard RTP techniques.
