      <t>This document describes a new framework for the transport of IPDatagrams over ISO MPEG-2 Transport Streams (TS). The MPEG-2 TS hasbeen widely accepted not only for providing digital TV services, butalso as a subnetwork technology for building IP networks. Examplesof systems using MPEG-2 include the Digital Video Broadcast (DVB)and Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) Standards forDigital Television. The document identifies the need for a set of Internet standardsdefining the interface between the MPEG-2 Transport Stream and an IPsubnetwork. It suggests a new encapsulation method for IP datagrams,and proposes protocols to perform IPv6/IPv4 address resolution, toassociate IP packets with the properties of the Logical Channelsprovided by an MPEG-2 TS.</t>
