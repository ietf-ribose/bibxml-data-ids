    <abstract>
      <t>This specification presents an approach to increase the security of block cipher operation modes based on re-keying (with no additional keys needed) during each separate message processing. It provides an internal re-keying mechanism called ACPKM. This mechanism doesn't require additional secret parameters or complicated transforms - for key update only the base encryption function is used.</t>
