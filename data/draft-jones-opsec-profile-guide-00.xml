      <t>This document provides guidelines for creating security capabilityprofiles. A profile is a list of features that are required tooperate a device in a a secure manner in a specific environment.It is anticipated that what is required in a profile will vary overtime and, across different classes of devices (e.g. a network edgedevice may need to filter customer traffic whereas core networkdevices may not), and in different organizations. This document doesnot define a profile or specify requirements, but rather givesguidance for their creation.</t>
