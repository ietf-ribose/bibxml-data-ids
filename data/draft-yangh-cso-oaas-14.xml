      <t>Data centers based applications provide a wide variety of services such as cloud computing, video gaming, grid application and others. Currently application decisions are made with little information concerning underlying network used to deliver those services so that such decisions cannot be the most optimal from both network and application resource utilization and quality of service objectives. This document presents a novel architecture of Cross Stratum Optimization for application and network resource in dynamic optical networks. Several global load balancing strategies are proposed and demonstrated by experiments in Optical as a Service experimental environment.</t>
