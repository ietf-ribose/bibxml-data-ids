      <t>This document describes the Secure Routing Protocol (SRP), a route discovery protocol for ad hoc networks that mitigates the detrimental effects of maliciously behaving nodes that disrupt the route discovery in order to obstruct or disable the network operation. Our protocol provides correct routing information; i.e., factual, up-to-date and authentic connectivity information regarding a pair of nodes that wish to communicate in a secure manner. The sole requirement is that any two such end nodes have a security association. Accordingly, SRP does not require that any of the intermediate nodes perform cryptographic operations or have a prior association with the end nodes. The end-to-end operation of SRP allows for efficient cryptographic mechanisms, such as message authentication codes. More importantly, SRP can be used in a wide range of MANET instances, without restrictive assumptions on the underlying trust, network size and membership.</t>
