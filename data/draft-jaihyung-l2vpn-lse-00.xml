      <t>LSE (Label Switched Ethernet) is a label switching technique for transmission of Ethernet frame. The method offers not only L2VPN connectivity but it also provides features for dynamic connection establishment and resource reservation. LSE does not require additional information fields other than 802.3 standard header because it uses destination address and source address as labels. As a result, compatibility with legacy Ethernet is maintained and it provides label switching service from terminal to terminal. Equipments that support LSE are connected via Ethernet tunnel merging tree or TLSP (Tunnel LSP) tree across legacy network equipment. User terminals establish connections using modified ARP protocol. Use of merging tree structure helps reducing signaling overhead as well as improving scalability of LSE network. LSE also provides unified mechanism for unicasting, multicasting and wireless terminal mobility.</t>
