      <t>LSE (Label Switched Ethernet) is a label switching technique fortransmission of Ethernet frame. The method offers not only L2VPNconnectivity but it also provides features for dynamic connectionestablishment and resource reservation. LSE does not requireadditional information fields other than 802.3 standard headerbecause it uses destination address and source address as labels. Asa result, compatibility with legacy Ethernet is maintained and itprovides label switching service from terminal to terminal.Equipments that support LSE are connected via Ethernet tunnel mergingtree or TLSP (Tunnel LSP) tree across legacy network equipment. Userterminals establish connections using modified ARP protocol. Use ofmerging tree structure helps reducing signaling overhead as well asimproving scalability of LSE network. LSE also provides unifiedmechanism for unicasting, multicasting and wireless terminal mobility.</t>
