    <abstract>
      <t>More and more emerging applications have raised the demand for establishing networking connections?anywhere and anytime, alongside the availability of highly distributive?any-cloud services. Such a demand motivates the need to efficiently interconnect heterogeneous entities, e.g., different domains of network and cloud owned by different providers, with the goal of reducing cost, e.g., overheads and end-to-end latency, while ensuring the overall performance satisfies the requirements of the applications. Considering that different network domains and cloud providers may adopt different types of technologies, the key of interconnection and efficient coordination is to employ a unified interface that can be understood by heterogeneous parties which could derive the consistent requirements of the same service and treat the service traffic appropriately by their proprietary policies and technologies. Therefore, service ID is one promising candidate for the unified interface since it could be designed to be lightweight, secure, and enables fast and efficient packet treatment. Leveraging service ID, addressing and networking among heterogeneous network domains and cloud providers can be accomplished by establishing the mapping between the unified service ID and the specific technologies used by a network domain or a cloud provider. This document provides typical use cases of unified service ID for addressing and routing (SIAN), validating that interconnecting different network domains or cloud providers can be achieved at lower cost without sacrificing the performance of application compared with existing methods of which problems as well as gaps have also been illustrated. The requirements for SIAN are also derived for each of the scenarios. Finally, a framework solution is demonstrated.</t>
