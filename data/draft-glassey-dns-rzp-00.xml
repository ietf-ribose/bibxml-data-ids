      <t>The changing structure and size of today's Internet has taxed the existing name services and their architecture to the breaking point. The DNS system of today was unfortunately architected to have a single root zone and limited set of Top Level Domains. This is defined usually in the set of root servers any resolving request uses to lookup an address. This proposal then is an attempt to lessen the impact on end-users and registrars and to allow IP owners a greater freedom in representing namespace to their customers. The elevator description is that this I-D proposes the restructuring of domain names more fully along the lines of a telephone number by creating a ROOT ZONE PROTOCOL as an addition to multiply the existing DNS services times the number of ROOT ZONES.</t>
