      <t>This note was motivated by the ongoing discussion in the Differentiated Services Working Group regarding the definition of the Assured Forwarding (AF) Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) Group. We consider two issues with the current proposal for AF PHB Group in [Heinanen]: the recommendation for AF discard mechanism, and the definition of AF classes. We discuss the implications of the definitions and recommendations that have raised comments and propose alternative texts.</t>
