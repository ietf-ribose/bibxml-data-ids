    <abstract>
      <t>The number of mobile users and their traffic demand is expected to be ever-increasing in future years, and this growth can represent a limitation for deploying current mobility management schemes that are intrinsically centralized, e.g., Mobile IPv6 and Proxy MIPv6. For this reason it has been waved a need for distributed and dynamic mobility management approaches, with the objective of reducing operators' burdens, evolving to a cheaper and more efficient architecture. This draft describes a solution to distribute the data forwarding plane on Proxy Mobile IPv6 domains, thus trying to overcome the suboptimal data path introduced when the LMA is traversed.</t>
