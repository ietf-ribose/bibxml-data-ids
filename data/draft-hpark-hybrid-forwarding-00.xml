      <t>This document describes the efficient mechanism to set up and maintain the LSP for the economy class services (called ES-LSP: Economy class Services LSP). The mechanism is to reduce the overload of MPLS networks and to continue the economy class services when the ES-LSP is failed. There are two parts to fulfill this mechanism. Firstly, it is to minimize the information to establish and to keep the ES-LSP. Secondly, in this mechanism, the nodes adjacent to the failure point may switch over the data packet to IP forwarding instead of MPLS label swapping. On the other hand, the adjacent nodes switch over the data packets to the label swapping of MPLS at the restoration of the failure. However, in general, the ES-LSP session is withdrawn, the ES-LSP itself is reestablished into the different route or the ES is discontinued by the ES-LSP failure[1]. Thus, for the service continuity of the failed ES-LSP, this mechanism uses the hybrid data forwarding of MPLS label swapping and IP forwarding.</t>
