      <t>Traditionally, Ethernet MAC rates were constrained to match the rates of the Ethernet PHY(s). OIF's implementation agreement [OIFMLG3] was the first step in allowing MAC rates to be different than the PHY rates. OIF has recently approved another implementation agreement [OIFFLEXE1] which allows complete decoupling of the MAC data rates and the Ethernet PHY(s) that support them. This includes support for (a) MAC rates which are greater than the rate of a single PHY (satisfied by bonding of multiple PHY(s)), (b) MAC rates which are less than the rate of a PHY (sub-rate), (c) support of multiple FlexE client signals carried over a single PHY, or over a collection of bonded PHY(s). The FlexE Shim functions which bond multipe Ethernet PHY(s) to realize a large "pipe" view of the connectivity between two FlexE aware devices as a collection of multiple point-to-point links (one link per Ethernet PHY). These logical point-to-point links can either be direct links (without an intervening transport network), or realized via an Optical transport network. This document describes usecases that reflect FlexE deployment scenarios and specifies the technical requirements for extensions to GMPLS control plane protocols to support these scenarios.</t>
