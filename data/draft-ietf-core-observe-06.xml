      <t>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and networks. The state of a resource on a CoAP server can change over time. This document specifies a simple protocol extension for CoAP that enables a server to replicate a resource state to interested clients. The protocol follows a best-effort approach when transmitting new resource states to a client, and provides eventual consistency between the state observed by the client and the actual resource state.</t>
