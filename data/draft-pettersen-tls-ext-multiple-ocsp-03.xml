      <t>This document introduces a replacement of the TLS Certificate Status Extension to allow clients to specify and support multiple certificate status methods. Also being introduced is a new OCSP- based method that servers can use to provide status information not just about the server's own certificate, but also the status of intermediate certificates in the chain.</t>
