    <abstract>
      <t>Group Based Policy can be used to achieve micro or macro segmentation of the user traffic. For Group Based Policy, a Group Policy ID, as known as Group Policy Tag, is used to represent a logical group that shares the same policy and access privilege. This specification defines a new BGP extended community that can be used to propagate Group Policy ID through a route advertisement in the control plane. This is to facilitate policy enforcement at the ingress node when the optimization of network bandwidth is desired.</t>
