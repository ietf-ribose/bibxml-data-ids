      <t>This memo is informational. It specifies a clarification of version 2 of the SNMP SMI, a standard for the Internet community, which is defined by RFCs 1902[1], 1903[2], and 1904[3]. The clarification is to fix a perceived inconsistency in the definition of the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION construct. This problem is resolved by replacement text for section 3.5 of RFC 1903.</t>
