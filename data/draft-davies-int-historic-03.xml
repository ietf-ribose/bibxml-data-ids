      <t>The document marks as historic any "int" domain names that were designated for infrastructure purposes, and identifies them for removal from the "int" top-level domain. Any implementation that involves these domains should be considered deprecated. This document also marks RFC 1528 and RFC 1706 as historic, and updates RFC 1591 by removing the documented use of "int" for international databases.</t>
