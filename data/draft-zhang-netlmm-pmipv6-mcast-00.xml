    <abstract>
      <t>With the development of various mobile technologies, mobile multicast becomes a research hotspot. Several mobile multicast schemes were proposed, but most of them are based on the Mobile IPv6 and its alternatives. Recently, the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) was proposed to provide the mobility support for mobile node without mobility function. However, the PMIPv6 mainly concerns on the unicast transmission support, and little considers the multicast routing. So, in this memo, we propose two mobile multicast mechanisms, the MAG- based method and LMA-based method to support the multicast routing in PMIPv6.</t>
