      <t>The amount of resources required by a source to send data to amulticast group within a network is dependent on the service levelthe source requested and the number of egress points for the group ina network. Since the egress points in a multicast group can changeduring a multicast session, a source node would not know how many orwhich egress points it would be sending to when it specifies theservice level it requires for multicast data.This document describes methods to control the number of egresspoints of a dynamic multicast group in a differentiated services (DS)network. A source node specifies the bandwidth, type of service and alimit on the number of egress points that it wants to send multicastdata to. If this limit on the number of egress points is reached, nofurther egress points will be grafted to the branch of the multicasttree rooted at this source node.</t>
