      <t>This document specifies encoding and encapsulation methods for MPLS big labels. Big labels are required for accessing virtual networks in data centers by using, for example, BGP/MPLS IP VPNs. Data center virtualization encapsulation methods and protocols such as VXLAN, NVGRE and NVO3 are being standardized to support a few millions of virtual networks, but the currently label format can support up to one million of labels. When the BGP/MPLS IP VPN method, for example, is used by an enterprise/customer to access its corresponding virtual networks, more than one million of labels are required to map VPN labels and Virtual Network Identifiers.</t>
