    <abstract>
      <t>The Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) Network Programming framework enables a network operator or an application to specify a packet processing program by encoding a sequence of instructions in the IPv6 packet header. Following the SRv6 Network Programming concept, this document defines an SRv6 based mechanism for inter-layer network programming, which can help to integrate the packet network layer with its underlying layers efficiently. A new SRv6 behavior called End.XU is introduced, which is a variant of the SRv6 End.X behavior. Instead of pointing to an interface with layer-3 adjacency, the End.XU behavior points to an underlay interface which connects to a remote layer-3 node via underlying links or connections that are invisible in the L3 network topology. The applicability of the End.XU behavior in typical inter- layer network programming scenarios is also illustrated.</t>
