      <t>The Internet Protocol, version 4 (IPv4) header includes a 16-bit Identification field in all packets, but this length is too small to ensure reassembly integrity even at moderate data rates in modern networks. Even for Internet Protocol, version 6 (IPv6), the 32-bit Identification field included when a Fragment Header is present may be smaller than desired for some applications. This specification addresses these limitations by defining both an IPv4 header option and an IPv6 Extended Fragment Header for Identification Extension; it further provides a messaging service for fragmentation and reassembly congestion management.</t>
