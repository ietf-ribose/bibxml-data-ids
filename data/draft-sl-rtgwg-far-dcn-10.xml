    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes a generic routing method and protocol for a regular data center network, named as fault-avoidance routing (FAR) protocol. FAR protocol provides a generic routing method for all types of network architectures that are proposed for large-scale cloud-based data centers over the past few years. FAR protocol is well designed to fully leverage the regularity in the topology and compute its routing table in a simplistic manner. Fat-tree is taken as an example architecture to illustrate how FAR protocol can be applied in real operational scenarios.</t>
