      <t>This documentary provides a routing, spectrum and core assignment method with the dividing frequency slots area for space division multiplexing elastic optical networks. This effective RSCA method to solve this problem better. The proposed method utilizes the Frequency Slots Area (FSA) concept and first-last fit policy of frequency slots assignment to have less spectrum fragments, lower crosstalk, smaller traffic blocking probability and higher spectrum resource utilization.</t>
