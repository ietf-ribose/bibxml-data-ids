      <t>One of the goals of DetNet is to provide bounded end-to-end latency for critical flows. This document defines how to leverage Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) to implement bounded latency. Specifically, new SRv6 SID function is used to specify transmission time (cycles) of a packet. When forwarding devices along the path follow the instructions carried in the packet, the bounded latency is achieved. This mechanism of latency guarantee is called Cycle Specified Queuing and Forwarding (CSQF) which is defined in [I-D.chen-detnet-sr-based-bounded-latency].</t>
