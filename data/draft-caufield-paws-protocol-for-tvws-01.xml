      <t>Regulatory entities in many countries are making spectrum previously used by television stations available for secondary use as a result of the switch from analog to digital. The spectrum in such cases is still owned by the primary user to whom it is licensed. However parts of the spectrum may be unused at a given location or time and hence can be made available for secondary use. In order to use such spectrum a device has to query a database in order to obtain a list of available channels or spectrum at a given location and time. This document specifies protocol elements that can be used to query a white space database and obtain a response by a device.</t>
