      <t>A deployment problem exists with existing self-configuring 6to4 implementations making often incorrect assumptions about the state of their IPv4 network connectivity. This document describes the problem, and proposes a qualification mechanism by which nodes can validate that their connectivity to the global IPv6 network is suitable for use with the 6to4 protocol.</t>
