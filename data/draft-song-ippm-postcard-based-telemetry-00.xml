    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a proposal which allows network OAM applications to collect telemetry data about any user packet. Unlike similar techniques such as INT and in-situ OAM, the Postcard-Based Telemetry (PBT) does not require inserting telemetry data into user packets, but directly exports the telemetry data to a collector through separated OAM packets called postcards. Two variations of PBT are described in this document: one requires inserting an instruction header to user packets to guide the data collection and the other only marks the user packets to invoke the data collection. Each has its own pros and cons. Either way, the postcards for a single user packet are from multiple devices and need to be correlated at the collector, which is a unique issue pertaining to PBT. Whereas, PBT provides an alternative to INT and address several implementation and deployment challenges of the INT-based solutions.</t>
