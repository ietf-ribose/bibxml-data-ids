    <abstract>
      <t>Measuring broadband performance on a large scale is important for network diagnostics by providers and users, as well as for public policy. The Large-scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) framework, information model, and protocol have been developed for measurement task dissemination, initialization, reporting and storing. This document uses ALTO protocol to provide access to large-scale network measurement results, which could be useful to constitute ALTO cost map service or endpoint cost service. Potential ALTO protocol extension is also discussed to better leverage LMAP measurement results.</t>
