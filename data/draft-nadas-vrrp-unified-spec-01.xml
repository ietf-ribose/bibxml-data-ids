      <t>This memo defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) forIPv4 and IPv6. It is version three (3) of the protocol and it isbased on VRRP (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined in RFC 3768 and ondraft-ieft-vrrp-ipv6-spec-08.txt. VRRP specifies an electionprotocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual routerto one of the VRRP routers on a LAN. The VRRP router controlling theIPv4 or IPv6 address(es) associated with a virtual router is calledthe Master, and forwards packets sent to these IPv4 or IPv6addresses. VRRP Master routers are configured with virtual IPv4 orIPv6 addresses and VRRP Backup routers infer the address family ofthe virtual addresses being carried based on the transport protocol.Within a VRRP router the virtual routers in each of the IPv4 and IPv6address families are a domain unto themselves and do not overlap.The election process provides dynamic fail over in the forwardingresponsibility should the Master become unavailable. For IPv4, theadvantage gained from using VRRP is a higher availability defaultpath without requiring configuration of dynamic routing or routerdiscovery protocols on every end-host. For IPv6, the advantagegained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker switch over to back uprouters than can be obtained with standard IPv6 Neighbor Discover(RFC 2461) mechanisms.</t>
