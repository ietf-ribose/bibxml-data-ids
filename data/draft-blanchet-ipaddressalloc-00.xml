      <t>This draft presents an IP address allocation scheme that enables the IP allocator (the organisation that allocates addresses) to postpone the final decision of prefix length by keeping space between allocated bits of the different parts of the IP address. This enables the allocator to change the different part lengths of the prefix (TLA, subTLA, SLA, ...) even after allocated spaces. This scheme is applicable to both IPv4 and IPv6 but is envisionned mainly for IPv6 where the address space is larger and more flexible.</t>
