      <t>This draft describes two specific extensions to RSVP-TE. The first extension is concerned about the scalability of RSVP-TE. It proposes expanding the length of tunnel ID in RSVP-TE session object, from 16 bits to 32 bits, in order to increase the upper limit of LSPs origin- ated from one node. The second extension is to propose a new object for representing a protection group. A protection group can tie two or more diverse LSPs between a source-destination pair of nodes. This extension is warranted due to the importance and wide-spread appli- cations of LSP protection switching mechanisms.</t>
