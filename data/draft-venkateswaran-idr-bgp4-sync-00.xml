      <t>BGP (Border gateway Protocol) is a routing protocol, which shares the information of its routing table on incremental basis. BGP needs to interact with the IGP peers within the autonomous system when all the routers inside the autonomous system do not run BGP. This document provides a detailed implementation of synchronization in BGP. This document specifies some implementation specifics of synchronization and also throws some of the pros and cons involved in implementing synchronization. This also reveals the points to be taken care when transition happens from synchronization to No synchronization and vice versa. Some of the precautions that are to be taken before implementing synchronization in BGP are also highlighted here.</t>
