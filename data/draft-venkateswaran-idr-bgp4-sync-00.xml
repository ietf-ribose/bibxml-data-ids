      <t>BGP (Border gateway Protocol) is a routing protocol, which sharesthe information of its routing table on incremental basis.BGP needs to interact with the IGP peers within the autonomoussystem when all the routers inside the autonomous system do not runBGP. This document provides a detailed implementation ofsynchronization in BGP.This document specifies some implementation specifics ofsynchronization and also throws some of the pros and cons involvedin implementing synchronization. This also reveals the points to betaken care when transition happens from synchronization to Nosynchronization and vice versa. Some of the precautions that are tobe taken before implementing synchronization in BGP are alsohighlighted here.</t>
