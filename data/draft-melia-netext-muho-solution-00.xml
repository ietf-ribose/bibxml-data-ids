      <t>This document provides extensions to Proxy Mobile IPv6 in order tosupport multihomed mobile nodes (MN). These extensions are intendedto permit such mobile nodes to send and receive IP packets onmultiple interfaces in a simultaneous and possibly discriminatedmanner when attached to a PMIPv6 domain. A typical usage of theseextensions is to perform downlink flow discrimination throughmultiple interfaces based on filtering rules (i.e. dedicate one MNinterface to VOIP traffic and another MN interface to HTTP traffic).The proposed extensions to PMIPv6 attempt to increment in a backwardcompatible manner the current PMIPv6 specification. In additionthese extensions use, when possible, existing specifications relatedto multihoming support at IETF and conform to the problem statementof Netext Working Group.</t>
