      <t>A wavelength switched optical network (WSON) requires that certain key information elements are made available to facilitate path computation and the establishment of label switching paths (LSPs). The information model described in "Routing and Wavelength Assignment Information for Wavelength Switched Optical Networks" shows what information is required at specific points in the WSON. The information may be used in Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling protocols, and may be distributed by GMSPL routing protocols. Other distribution mechanisms (for example, XML-based protocols) may also be used. This document provides efficient, protocol-agnostic encodings for the information elements necessary to operate a WSON. It is intended that protocol-specific documents will reference this memo to describe how information is carried for specific uses. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].</t>
