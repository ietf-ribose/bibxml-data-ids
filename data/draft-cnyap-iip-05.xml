      <t>This document specifies a protocol that allows any IP node to communicate with other IP nodes in the mobile environment without any fundamental changes to TCP/IP. Any mobile aware nodes are able to communicate with one another with standard IP routing. Mobile awareness is achieved by means of address updates through a query mechanism. Backward compatibility capability is supported via the means of one or more anchoring points that are put in place.</t>
