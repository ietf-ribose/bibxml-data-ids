      <t>The IETF brings together a technical community that shares acommon dedication to making the best possible engineering choicesand protocol standards for the Internet as whole. The communityshares a number of common beliefs, which create the basis of acommon work style and inform many of the decisions made within theIETF. As in many communities of believers, some of these beliefshave been elevated to the status of dogma. In the process ofconsidering reform, the treatment of these as unquestionable maybe hindering progress. This document challenges some of thebeliefs which the author believes have become dogmatic. It alsopresents two visions for the evolution of the IETF and articulatesa single belief.</t>
