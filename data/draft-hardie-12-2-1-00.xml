      <t>The IETF brings together a technical community that shares a common dedication to making the best possible engineering choices and protocol standards for the Internet as whole. The community shares a number of common beliefs, which create the basis of a common work style and inform many of the decisions made within the IETF. As in many communities of believers, some of these beliefs have been elevated to the status of dogma. In the process of considering reform, the treatment of these as unquestionable may be hindering progress. This document challenges some of the beliefs which the author believes have become dogmatic. It also presents two visions for the evolution of the IETF and articulates a single belief.</t>
