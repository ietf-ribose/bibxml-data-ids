      <t>Recently several multicast mechanisms were proposed that scale betterwith the number of multicast groups than traditional multicast does.These proposals are known as small group multicast (SGM) or explicitmulticast (Xcast). Explicit multicast protocols, such as the Xcast protocol, encode the list of group members in the Xcast header of every packet. If the number of members in a group increases, routersmay need to fragment an Xcast packet. Fragmented packets may not be identified as Xcast packets by routers. In this paper, we show that the Xcast protocol does not support the IP fragmentation and we showalso that avoiding fragmentation induces hard-coded limits inside theprotocol itself in terms of group size. First, we describe the Xcastprotocol, the Xcast+ protocol (which is an extension of Xcast) and wecompare these two protocols with traditional multicast protocols.Wepropose then a generalized version of the Xcast protocol, calledGXcast, intended to permit the Xcast packets fragmentation and tosupport the increasing in the number of members in a multicastgroup.</t>
