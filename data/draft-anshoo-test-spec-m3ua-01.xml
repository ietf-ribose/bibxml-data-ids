      <t>This document presents the test specification for M3UA (MTP3 User Adaptation) protocol (RFC 3332), which can be used to test M3UA implementations for conformance to the protocol definition. The list of test is exhaustive and covers almost all the categories of test. This draft can also be used in conjunction with M3UA specification by implementers of protocol as implementers guide, as the pictorial representation of various scenarios help easy understanding of the protocol. Next revision of the draft will cover the additions done to the protocol revision and any subsequent RFC published by IETF.</t>
