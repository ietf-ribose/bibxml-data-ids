      <t>RFC 3630 [RFC3630] describes extensions to OSPF protocol RFC 2328 [RFC2328] to support intra-area Traffic Engineering (TE). For multiple applications such as High Performance Computing and Electronic Financial markets, response times are critical. This document defines the Traffic Engineering (TE) extensions to RFC 3630 [RFC3630] and and RFC 5329 [RFC5329] for defining a delay metric, which can be used by latency sensistive applications.</t>
