      <t>There is an strong demand from IP network operators to obtain a method to control the network resource and enhance network performance. The answer for this is Traffic Engineering. It is derived through the effort in MPLS wg. But current, the concept of Traffic Engineering seems to be limited to a few keywords, namely load balancing and restoration. The aim of this document is to enhance the concept of traffic engineering and point out some aspects of what it is capable of. The goal of this document is accomplished if this document could enlighten the perspective of IP Traffic Engineering and show a possible direction.</t>
