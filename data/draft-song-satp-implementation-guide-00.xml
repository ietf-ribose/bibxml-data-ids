    <abstract>
      <t>This memo provides guidelines to developers of gateway systems, digital asset networks and client applications for the Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP). Multiple gateways can represent the same digital asset network following the SATP standards, which necessitate basic implementation guidelines as outlined in this document. It also serves as an introduction to the SATP processing workflow for those new to the SATP standards. (Note. the initial draft (00) is submitted for a brief review regarding the document's direction by SATP WG members during IETF 12 in Bangkok, Mar 2025)</t>
