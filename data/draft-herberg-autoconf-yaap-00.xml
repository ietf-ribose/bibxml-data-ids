      <t>This document describes automatic configuration of MANET router interfaces, as well as prefix delegation to MANET routers. This autoconfiguration protocol is characterized by (i) adhering strictly to the Internet addressing architecture, (ii) being able to configure both MANET interface addresses and handle prefix delegation, and (iii) being able to configure both stand-alone MANETs, as well as MANETs connected to an infrastructure providing, e.g., globally scoped addresses/prefixes for use within the MANET.</t>
