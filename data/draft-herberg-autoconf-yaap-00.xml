      <t>This document describes automatic configuration of MANET routerinterfaces, as well as prefix delegation to MANET routers. Thisautoconfiguration protocol is characterized by (i) adhering strictlyto the Internet addressing architecture, (ii) being able to configureboth MANET interface addresses and handle prefix delegation, and(iii) being able to configure both stand-alone MANETs, as well asMANETs connected to an infrastructure providing, e.g., globallyscoped addresses/prefixes for use within the MANET.</t>
