      <t>Despite IPv6 was developed to replace IPv4, the transition process did not and will not ramp up as expected. Major reason for stalled deployment is non-technical, but historical knowledge as well as established processes. The missing part between IPv4 and IPv6 is designed to help the migration efforts by addressing the non- technical needs for a smooth transition.</t>
