      <t>Various attacks including delay attack have become a topic in the security of Internet of Things (IoT), especially for the constrained nodes utilizing sensors and actuators which connect and interact with the physical world. [I-D.mattsson-core-coap-actuators] describes several serious delay attacks, discusses tougher requirements and then recommends mechanisms to mitigate the attacks. It also specifies some disadvantages with the mechanisms. This document proposes alternative mechanisms to address some of the disadvantages</t>
