      <t>In this document we define two new ICMP message types. These new types of ICMP messages can be used as probe packets to support a variety of measurement applications. This draft gives detailed definition and format of these two new ICMP message types. It is in full conformance with the original RFC on ICMP [1], and complements the work of the IPPM working group [6][7][8]. The extension of ICMP for one-way traffic measurement is also useful for traffic engineering.</t>
