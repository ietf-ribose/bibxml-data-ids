      <t>The IEEE has defined P802.1ag Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) for managingbridged LAN networks. The IETF has defined L2 Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)that provide an emulated LAN service for such bridged networks. These L2 VPNs arecreated using a collection of one or more point-to-point pseudo wires (PWs). TheIETF has also defined Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) formanaging these PWs. This memo discusses the ability of a combination of CFM andVCCV to meet the OAM requirements of a L2 VPN.</t>
