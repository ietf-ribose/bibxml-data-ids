      <t>General switch management protocol (GSMP) is an open interface protocol between a label switch and a controller, and it provides connection, configuration, event, performance management and synchronization. Traditionally, network management services are classified into five categories: those are configuration, performance, fault, accounting, and security management. The companion draft document discussed the implementation complexity of a label switch and the efficiency of resource usage according to the location of network management functions. This document defines managed objects to support network management services in the GSMP interface.</t>
