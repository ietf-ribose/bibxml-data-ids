      <t>Real-time communication systems evolved by solving discrete problems independently: session establishment, transport, media handling, security, analytics, and compliance were addressed as separate concerns. For two decades, the resulting architectural fragmentation was tolerable. That tolerance has ended. This document argues that the convergence of Zero Trust security requirements, AI-driven computational demands, accessibility mandates, data residency enforcement, and next-generation transport capabilities now exceeds the coordination capacity of fragmented architectures. The failure is not incremental but fundamental: real-time systems lack a control layer capable of maintaining continuous session identity across orchestration, policy enforcement, and computation. This architectural gap was not anticipated by existing standards or platform designs. Its recognition requires reduction rather than expansion, collapsing fragmented contexts into unified session governance. This document examines the historical evolution that produced this gap, analyzes why current approaches fail under convergent pressures, and articulates the architectural constraint necessary for future systems.</t>
