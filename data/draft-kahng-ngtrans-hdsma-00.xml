      <t>This document specifies the requirements for MIPv4/MIPv6 transition. Researches on the IPv4 to IPv6, or IPv6 to IPv4, transition mechanisms are actively being conducted. These transition mechanisms assume that hosts are attached to the network statically. Currently, developments of communication mechanisms are developed individually and differently. This means that the effects of considering mobile node (MN) roaming in IPv4/IPv6 transition networks have not been investigated. Therefore, this document proposes the requirements and analysis of different routing architecture of MIPv4/MIPv6 transition network.</t>
