ViPR makes use of the PSTNas an introduction mechanism to verify the correctness of mappingsfrom phone numbers to domains. The PSTN introduction mechanism canalso be used as a technique for blocking spam - a SIP caller is onlyauthorized when its calling domain has previously called that samenumber over the PSTN.
