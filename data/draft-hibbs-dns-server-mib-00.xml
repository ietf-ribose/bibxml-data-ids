      <t>This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet Community. In particular, it defines objects used for the management of Domain Name System (DNS) servers, and reserves an experimental branch in the MIB-2 tree for DNS servers and resolvers. This version (the '-00' draft) is the initial draft of an intended replacement for RFC1611 which was changed to Historic status in October, 2001, and is intended to generate discussion and comment on the desirability and usefulness of a DNS server MIB.</t>
