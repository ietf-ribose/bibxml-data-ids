      <t>The history of secure messaging in XMPP is spotty. The long-running de facto scheme, OTR, enjoys fairly wide implementation and use, but OTR suffers from some serious usability and security shortcomings that make it unsuitable as a basis for encryption. This document describes an architecture that provides end-to-end confidentiality and integrity for XMPP messaging. Solutions for both multi-user and one-to-one messaging are provided.</t>
