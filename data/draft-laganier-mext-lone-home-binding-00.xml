      <t>RFC5648 extends MIPv6 with the ability for a Mobile Node to registerMultiple Care-of Addresses with its Home Agent and CorrespondentNode(s). RFC 5648 also introduces the notion of a Home Binding thatis essentially a binding on the Home Link, where the Care-of Addressis set to the Home Address of the Mobile Node. A Mobile Node usessuch a Home Binding together with one or more Multiple Care-ofAddress binding(s) to be able to use simultaneously both the HomeLink and one or more visited link(s). The description of the HomeBinding in a section of RFC 5846 entitled "Returning Home:Simultaneous Home and Visited Link Operation" seems to imply that aHome Binding can only be legitimately created while returning homeand maintaining simultaneous bindings on one or more visited link(s).There is however no specific reason to prevent creation of such aHome Binding when the Mobile Node is only attached to the Home Linkand does not have any interface attached to a visited link.Moreover, there is a specific use case for the creation of such aLone Home Binding. This specification explicits the use case forcreation of a Lone Home Binding, and clarifies the protocol behaviorof Mobile IPv6 nodes (Mobile Node, Home Agent, Correspondent Node)involved with its creation.</t>
