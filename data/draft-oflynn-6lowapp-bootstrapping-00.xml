      <t>The Internet of Things is marching it's way towards completition.Nodes can use standards from the 6LoWPAN and ROLL WG to achieve IPconnectivity. IEEE Standards ensure connectivity at lower layers forresource-constrained devices. Yet a central problem remains at amore basic layer without a suitable answer: how to initiallyconfigure the network. Without configuration the network neveradvances beyond a large box of nodes. Current solutions tend to bespecific to a certain vendor, node type, or application.This document outlines exactly what problems are faced in solvingthis problem. General problems faced in any low-power wirelessnetwork are outlined first; followed by how these apply tobootstrapping. A selection of currently proposed techniques ispresented. From these a more generic approach is presented, whichcan solve the problem for a wide range of situations.An emphasis is on performing this bootstrapping in a secure manner.This document does not cover operationg of the network securely.This document does provide the basis for allowing the network tooperate securely however, by providing standard methods for keyexchanges and authentication.</t>
