      <t>This document proposes a new fast start-up mechanism for TCP that can be used to speed the beginning of an Internet connection and then improved the short-lived TCP connections performance. Initial Spreading allows to safely increase the Initial Window size in any cases, and notably in congested networks. Merging the increase in the IW with the spacing of the segments belonging to the Initial Window (IW), Initial Spreading is a very simple mechanism that improves short-lived TCP flows performance and do not deteriorate long-lived TCP flows performance.</t>
