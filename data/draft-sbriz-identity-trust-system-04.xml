      <t>This document defines an *identity trust system*, which is a digital identity authentication system based on a symmetric exchange of authentication messages that does not require federation of authentication domains. The main components are: 1. *Symmetric authentication protocol* - A protocol for the mutual recognition of entities based on a symmetric exchange of authentication messages through the mediation of Identity Providers (IdPs). It builds on and extends the OAuth Authorization Framework RFC6749. 2. *Trustees network* - The IdPs network infrastructure that provides a secure environment for exchanging authentication messages. 3. *Custodian concept* - A special category of IdPs to protect physical identity and personal data. The generic IdP is called "*_trustee_*" and is only responsible for digital authentication, while the special IdP called "*_custodian_*" has the legal right to process the individual's real data and maintain the relationship with the digital identity. Custodian acts under the direct control of the authorities of the individual's country.</t>
