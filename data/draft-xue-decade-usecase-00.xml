      <t>The objective of DECADE is to provide storage access to Content Distribution Applications to improve their efficiency and reduce load on the network infrastructure. In this document, we outline several potential use cases (not technical solutions) for DECADE. These use cases may provide motivations for DECADE. Interactions within DECADE and between DECADE Servers and DECADE Clients are described at an abstract level so as to not constrain future protocol development.</t>
