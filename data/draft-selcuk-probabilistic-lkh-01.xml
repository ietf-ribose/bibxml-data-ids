      <t>Currently, the most efficient techniques for multicast key managementare based on the Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) scheme. In currentpractice, LKH trees are organized as balanced binary trees, whichgive a uniform O(log n) complexity for compromise recovery in an n-member group. In this draft, we propose organizing the LKH trees withrespect to the members' compromise probabilities instead of keeping abalanced tree, in a spirit similar to data compression techniquessuch as Huffman and Shannon-Fano coding. We describe two suchprobabilistic algorithms which improve the performance of an LKHscheme by probabilistic organization of the tree. Preliminarysimulation results show that significant gains can be obtained bythese techniques.</t>
