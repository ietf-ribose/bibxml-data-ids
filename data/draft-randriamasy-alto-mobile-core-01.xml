      <t>The ALTO working group provides guidance to P2P applications, whichhave to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates, thatare able to provide a desired resource. This guidance shall be basedon parameters that affect performance and efficiency of the datatransmission between the hosts, e.g., the topological distance. Theultimate goal is to improve performance (or Quality of Experience) inthe application while reducing resource consumption in the underlyingnetwork infrastructure.The present document addresses the case of ALTO transactionsinvolving a peers connected via a mobile core network. It proposesspecific scopes and use cases for mobile core networks and as a firststep, properties of paths and endpoints that allow to facilitate ALTOtransaction within such a scope.</t>
