      <t>The ALTO working group provides guidance to P2P applications, which have to select one or several hosts from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desired resource. This guidance shall be based on parameters that affect performance and efficiency of the data transmission between the hosts, e.g., the topological distance. The ultimate goal is to improve performance (or Quality of Experience) in the application while reducing resource consumption in the underlying network infrastructure. The present document addresses the case of ALTO transactions involving a peers connected via a mobile core network. It proposes specific scopes and use cases for mobile core networks and as a first step, properties of paths and endpoints that allow to facilitate ALTO transaction within such a scope.</t>
