      <t>A white space master device needs to query a white space database and obtain information about available spectrum/channels prior to operation. White space databases which contain information about available spectrum/channels are associated with a regulatory domain. A white space master device needs to discover the relevant white space database(s) given its current location and in which regulatory domain that it is operating. The white space database discovery is the preliminary step that a white space master device has to perform.</t>
