      <t>Multiple applications related to the domain name system are built around a list of data elements. There is currently no unified public list of these data elements, nor is there an organized and independent change control process. This document codifies the multiple similar but not quite identical lists of data elements into a neutral DNS Data Dictionary to be maintained as an independent IANA Registry.</t>
