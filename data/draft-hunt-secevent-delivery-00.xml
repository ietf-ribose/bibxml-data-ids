    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines how a series of security event tokens (SETs) may be delivered to a previously registered receiver using HTTP POST over TLS initiated as a push to the receiver, or as a poll by the receiver. The specification also defines how delivery can be assured subject to the SET Token Receiver's need for assurance.</t>
