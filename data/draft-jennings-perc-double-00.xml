      <t>In some conferencing scenarios, it is desirable for an intermediary to be able to manipulate some RTP parameters, while still providing strong end-to-end security guarantees. This document defines a SRTP procedures that uses two separate but related cryptographic contexts to provide "hop by hop" and "end to end" security guarantees. Both the end-to-end and hop-by-hop cryptographic transforms can utilizes an authenticated encryption with associated data scheme or take advantage of future SRTP transforms with different properties. SRTCP is encrypted hop-by-hop using an already-defined SRTCP cryptographic transform.</t>
