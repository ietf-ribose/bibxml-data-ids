      <t>When a standard Mobile IP node (MN) changes its wireless network attachment point (performs a handover), it gets new IP layer configuration information (a new network prefix and address of a new default gateway) from a new access router and tries to know whether it has moved to other subnet. If it has, it changes its IP layer configuration. During such a handover process,it cannot send and receive IP packets from its corresponding node(CN), so a service disruption is caused. In this document, we introduce new DHCP options. With them, DHCP servers can send new information before a handover to be used after the handover, and MNscan reduce handover process time.</t>
