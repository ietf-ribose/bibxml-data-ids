      <t>This document describes an extension to the Network News Transport Protocol[RFC977] that allows NNTP peers to dynamically adjust their criteria for sending network news articles to one another. This extension provides only for the addition of 'negative' criteria, i.e., criteria for articles that are not to be sent. It is believed that a more comprehensive scheme allowing for 'positive' criteria, while desirable, would not receive wide deployment in the Internet because of concerns about security and intellectual property. The extension described in this document does not present these concerns and allows for gains in network efficiency.</t>
