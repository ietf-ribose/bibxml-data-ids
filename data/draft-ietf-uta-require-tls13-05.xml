    <abstract>
      <t>TLS 1.2 is in use and can be configured such that it provides good security properties. TLS 1.3 use is increasing, and fixes some known deficiencies with TLS 1.2, such as removing error-prone cryptographic primitives and encrypting more of the traffic so that it is not readable by outsiders. For these reasons, new protocols must require and assume the existence of TLS 1.3. As DTLS 1.3 is not widely available or deployed, this prescription does not pertain to DTLS (in any DTLS version); it pertains to TLS only. This document updates RFC9325.</t>
