      <t>The IMAP4 [RFC-2060] protocol is based on the client-server paradigm where a single client is concerned only with the mail of a single user. However, due to advent of several scenarios where n-tier interaction is desired, the need has arisen to work with several users' mail during a single IMAP4 connection. In such scenario, a component of a n-tier system may act as an IMAP4 client on behalf of multiple end-users. Present examples of this include many WWW-based email services. Initial profiling suggests that persistent IMAP4 connections can lead to a performance increase of an order of magnitude when compared to separate IMAP4 connections per mailbox action. This document defines an extension to the IMAP4 protocol that allows a persistent connection to be established for accessing the mail of multiple users. The extension includes a new USERLOGOUT command, and a requirement for a CAPABILITIES response from servers implementing the extension.</t>
