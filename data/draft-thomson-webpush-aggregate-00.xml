      <t>The Web Push protocol provides a means of ensuring constant network availability of devices that would otherwise have limited availability. This document describes extensions to that protocol that enable the efficient delivery of messages to multiple devices. This allows an application to request that a web push server deliver the same message to a potentially large set of devices.</t>
