      <t>This draft describes a multicast routing protocol for mobile ad hocnetworks (MANETs). The protocol---termed Differential DestinationMulticast (DDM)---differs from common approaches proposed for ad hocmulticast routing in two ways. Firstly, instead of distributingmembership control throughout the network, DDM concentrates thisauthority at the data sources (i.e. senders) thereby giving sendersknowledge of group membership. Secondly, differentially-encoded,variable-length destination headers are inserted in data packetswhich are used in combination with unicast routing tables to forwardmulticast packets towards multicast receivers. Instead of requiringthat multicast forwarding state be stored in participating nodes,this approach also provides the option of stateless multicasting.Each node independently has the choice of maintaining cachedforwarding state, or requesting its upstream neighbor to insert thisstate into self-routed data packets, or some combination thereof.The protocol is best suited for use with small multicast groupsoperating in dynamic networks of any size.</t>
