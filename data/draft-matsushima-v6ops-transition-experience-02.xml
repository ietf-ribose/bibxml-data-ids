      <t>Service Providers will apply their use case when conducting IPv6 transition and determine helpful solutions with the assistance of the IPv6 transition guideline document. More than one solution is possible, and decisions must be made from not only the technical point of view, but also from the economic point of view. This document describes the conclusions reached by one operator based on their considerations and their plans for IPv6 transition so as to assist others who may have similar circumstances.</t>
