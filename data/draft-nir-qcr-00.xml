      <t>This document describes an extension to the IKEv2 protocol thatallows for faster crash recovery using a saved token method.When an IPsec tunnel between two IKEv2 implementations isdisconnected due to a restart of one peer, it can take as much asseveral minutes to recover. In this text we propose an extension tothe protocol, that allows for recovery within a few seconds of thereboot.</t>
