      <t>Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides the ability to classify and steer a flow via some network service(s). Some traffic flows require re-classification to a new service chain. This may be, for example, the result of further analysis of initial packets, or detection of multiple types of media. This document discusses re-classification scenarios in SFC, and several deployment models for the re-classifier and relevant analysis are provided. The proposal will recommend some architectural constraints for the SFC design.</t>
