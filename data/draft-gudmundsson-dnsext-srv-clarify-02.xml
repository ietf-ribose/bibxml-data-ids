      <t>The DNS SRV record has been specified in RFC 2052 and RFC 2782 for use in dynamic service discovery for a domain. These two RFCs did not clearly specify an IANA registry for the names of the services and their underlying protocols. This document clarifies RFC 2782 regarding the formation and use of the Service Prefix in the owner name of SRV records, based on the unified IANA "Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number" registry and provides a few other corrections, clarifications, and usage recommendations.</t>
