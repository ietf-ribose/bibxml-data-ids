      <t>The Efficient Protocol Independent Compression [EPIC] scheme is a general mechanism for providing additional profiles for use within the [ROHC8] framework. The EPIC inputset is a list of fields from the protocol stack to be compressed, and for each field a choice of encoding techniques together with the probabilities that they will be used. The output of EPIC is a set of optimally efficient compressed header formats for the chosen protocol stack, and an automatic mechanism for translating between compressed and uncompressed packet formats.</t>
