      <t>This document proposes an approach to support Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) in Virtual Private LAN Service using BGP for auto-discovery and signaling [RFC4761]. The proposed solution is characterized by breaking pseudowire between Leafs to fulfill the specific E-Tree requirement: Leaf cannot communicate with Leaf. Backward compatibility is also considered.</t>
