      <t>OSPF is a link state routing protocol used for IP-network topology discovery using different types of Link State Advertisements. The resulting Link State Database (LSDB) is used to compute IP address forwarding table based on shortest-path criteria. OSPF has been extended to support Traffic Engineering, QoS in packet and non-packet networks. These has been a serious concern regarding scalability and convergence of information in large networks. This memo documents an optional OSPF capability to support TE only functionality. This OSPF TE Only option is to support existing and future Traffic Engineering extensions for packet and/or non-packet networks with out exchanging any hop-by-hop routing information. This is accomplished by exchanging T-bit option in OSPF Hello packets. This gives flexibility of supporting larger TE areas, increased scalability and improved convergence.</t>
