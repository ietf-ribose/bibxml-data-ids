      <t>[RFC1884] specified two IPv6 address forms that encapsulated IPv4 addresses. [RFC1886] specified a new DNS RR type (AAAA) to map domain names to IPv6 addresses, and also specified the form of the PTR RR owner name used to map IPv6 addresses back to the domain name of that host or interface. This memo amends [RFC1886] and gives two exceptions to its rules regarding PTR RR owner name correspondance to IPv6 addresses. Specifically, the two IPv4 encapsulation methods are exempted from [RFC1886]'s nybble mapping, and are made subject to the appropriate rules from [RFC1035] and [RFC1101].</t>
