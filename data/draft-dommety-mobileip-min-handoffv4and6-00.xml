      <t>Currently Mobile IP WG is carrying out very interesting work in thearea of Fast/Low latency handoffs for Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4. Thehigh level goal of this work is to reduce the latency during thechange of point of attachement to the Internet (AKA Handoff) Thisdocument discusses one simple case that in the author's opinion isvery common and can be optimized to achevie lower latency than thatproposed by the various solutions. This scenario applies to both IPv6and IPv4 work. The solution at a high level is the same, butrealization will be different as the frame work in IPv6 case isdifferent from that of the IPv4 case.</t>
