      <t>This document describes the applicability of Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 in 802.11 networks. Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 proposes a set of protocol enhancements to reduce handover latency due to IP protocol operations as small as possible by the help of L2 information. 802.11 networks are considered as a popular wireless infrastructure to meet broadband network service requirement in the future. If Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 is applied to wireless network, 802.11 might be a practicable target for deployment. At this point some Fast Handover methods for Mobile IPv6 are thought to be directly applicable to 802.11 networks and some others are not.</t>
