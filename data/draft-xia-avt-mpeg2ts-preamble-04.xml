      <t>The ITU-T Rec. H.222.0 | ISO/IEC 13818-1 Transport Stream (MPEG2-TS)addresses the combining of one or more elementary streams of videoand audio, as well as other data, into single or multiple streamswhich are suitable for storage or transmission. The necessary andsufficient information contained in the Program SpecificInformation(PSI) tables to demultiplex and present programs must beacquired before a RTP receiver can process any data received inMPEG2-TS. In this document, a Retransmission Server is specified todeliver MPEG2-TS preamble prior to unicast burst RTP packets. TheRetransmission Server caches raw RTP packets with MPEG2-TS preambleinformation, and sends them to the RTP receiver which initiates rapidacquisition of MPEG2-TS multicast sessions.</t>
