    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines a framework how to update L4S Dual-Queue Coupled AQM with In Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM). These are designed for consistently very low queuing latency, very low congestion loss, and scaling of perflow throughput by using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) using the operational and telemetry information collected by IOAM. Since L4S lacks information about the use of network status and network nodes, which also affect network performance in practice, it is considered to use direct export mode for information collection of L4S-IOAM to strengthen the AQM regulation of L4S. It then gives the normative requirements that are necessary.</t>
