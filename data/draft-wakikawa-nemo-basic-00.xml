    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes a solution for Basic Network Support. Itproposes Mobile IPv6 extensions as advocated by the NEMO workinggroup. Our solution differs from Prefix Scope Binding Update (PSBU)which was originally proposed before the NEMO working group was setup. Our draft however uses mechanisms similar to those of PSBU, suchas 'Prefix binding' and 'Searching mechanism of prefix binding'.The main difference relies on the management of the permanent addressof the MR, which is assigned to the ingress interface, and not to theegress interface.</t>
