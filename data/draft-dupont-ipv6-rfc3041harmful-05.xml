      <t>The purpose of the privacy extensions for stateless addressautoconfiguration [1] is to change the interface identifier (andthe global-scope addresses generated from it) over time in orderto make it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other informationcollectors to identify when different addresses used in differenttransactions actually correspond to the same node.Current Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) [2] attacks employforged source addresses which can also be in the same prefixesthan the real addresses of the compromised nodes used for attacks.Indeed, network ingress filtering defeats DDoS using 'random'forged source addresses.</t>
