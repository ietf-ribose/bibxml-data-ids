      <t>This document describes a general notary service and the protocols to be used when communicating with it. The Notary Authority is a Trusted Third Party (TTP) that can be used as one component in building reliable non-repudiation services (see [ISONR]). Useful Notary Authority responsibilities in a PKI are to validate signatures and to provide up- to-date information regarding the status of certificates. We give examples of how to use the notary to extend the lifetime of a signature beyond key expiry or revocation and to query the notary regarding the status of a certificate.</t>
