    <abstract>
      <t>This document formalizes and consolidates the definition of the Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN) of the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR), addressing implementer experience. Replacing EDN's previous informal descriptions, it updates RFC 8949, obsoleting its Section 8, and RFC 8610, obsoleting its Appendix G. It also specifies and uses registry-based extension points, using one to support text representations of epoch-based dates/times and of IP addresses and prefixes. // (This cref will be removed by the RFC editor:) The present // revision (–16) addresses the first half of the WGLC comments, // except for the issues around the specific way how to best achieve // pluggable ABNF grammars for application-extensions. It is // intended for use as a reference document for the mid-WGLC CBOR WG // interim meeting on 2025-01-08.</t>
