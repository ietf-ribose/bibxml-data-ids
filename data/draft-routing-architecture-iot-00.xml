      <t>The IETF ROLL Working Group has specified a routing protocol designedfor the Low power and Lossy Networks (LLN) also referred to as IPsmart objects networks or the "Internet of things". Still, thedebate of where routing functions should occur within the networkstack tend to get revived on a regular basis. A mesh-under approachplaces routing functions in the link layer to emulate a singlebroadcast domain where all devices appear as immediate neighbors tothe network layer. In contrast, a route-over approach places allrouting functions at the network layer, following the IParchitecture.For LLNs, a mesh-under approach may seem simple and attractivebecause it seeks to hide characteristics of multi-hop communicationthrough the LLN from the network layer. However, resourceconstraints and dynamic link characteristics limit to what extentlink-layer routing can hide those characteristics. This documentpresents architectural issues of using a mesh-under approach in LLNsand how a route-over approach does not suffer from these issues.</t>
