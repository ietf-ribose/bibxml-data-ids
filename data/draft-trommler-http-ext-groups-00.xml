      <t>This document motivates and describes an extension to HTTP which allows protection spaces to be extended across multiple servers residing in possibly different domains. These servers form groups that allow browsers to obtain authentication information from a user just once while accessing information on any one server cooperating in such a group. To achieve this behavior, the HTTP WWW-Authenticate header information must be extended. This approach is independent of the authentication scheme, but is most scalable in conjunction with a trusted third party authentication scheme, such as the proposed Mediated Digest Authentication.</t>
