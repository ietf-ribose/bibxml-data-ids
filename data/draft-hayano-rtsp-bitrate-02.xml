      <t>Typically, there is no use for providing bandwidth information froman RTSP 2.0 server to RTSP 2.0 clients. The bandwidth of the mediasplayed out by the server is different from the available bandwidth inthe network (which is also changing) and there is anyhow the need toperform congestion control during media playout. This is true forInternet deployments, or similar, but conveying information aboutbandwidth of the medias can be required in other deployments of RTSP2.0. It might necessarily for RTSP 2.0 clients to obtain informationabout the by medias used bandwidth in networks that rely on bandwidthreservation initiated by the end host. An example is the NextGeneration Network (NGN) standardized by ETSI TISPAN, where RTSP 2.0clients must indicate the required bandwidth to the network. Thismemo discusses how to provide bandwidth information from RTSP 2.0servers to clients and how to introduce it in RTSP 2.0.</t>
