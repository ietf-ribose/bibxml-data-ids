      <t>Flexible grid is regarded as an efficient way to improve the network capacity utilization. Mixed bit rate transmission systems can allocate their channel with different spectral bandwidths so that they can be optimized for the bandwidth requirements of the particular bit rate and modulation scheme of the individual channels. To support the flexible grid technique, this document extends the wavelength label to accommodate this new specification. It is demonstrated that the extended label format is compatible to the rigid one and can be used in the routing and signaling procedure in the Wavelength Switched Optical Network (WSON).</t>
