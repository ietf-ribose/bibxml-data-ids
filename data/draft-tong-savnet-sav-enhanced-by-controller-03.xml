    <abstract>
      <t>Many newly proposed Source Address Validation (SAV) mechanisms such as IGP-based and BGP-based SAVNET solutions take a distributed manner to generate SAV rules, but they are faced with accuracy and managability challenges in incremental/partial deployment scenarios. This document proposes a network controller-based solution for enhancing SAVNET capability in intra-domain and inter-domain networks, which supports accurate verification, automated configuration, threat analysis, traceability and visualization.</t>
