      <t>This memo proposes an optional fast-track way to get from a working group document to IESG review that can be used for cases when a working group chair believes that there is running code that implements a working group Internet-Draft. The basic idea is to do all of working group last call, IETF last call and area director review during the same two week period, and to impose a higher barrier for comments that might block progress. The motivation is to have the IETF process have a built-in reward for running code, consistent with the IETF's overall philosophy of running code and rough consensus. This version is solely proposed by the author (and not the IESG) to attempt to ascertain if there is enough interest in this to warrant trying out the idea as an RFC 3933 process experiment.</t>
