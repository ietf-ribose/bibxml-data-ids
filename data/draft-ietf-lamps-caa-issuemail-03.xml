      <t>The Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS resource record (RR) provides a mechanism for domains to express the allowed set of Certification Authorities (CAs) that are authorized to issue certificates for the domain. RFC 8659 contains the core CAA specification, where Property Tags that restrict the issuance of certificates which certify domain names are defined. This specification defines a Property Tag that grants authorization to CAs to issue certificates which certify email addresses that include the domain name.</t>
