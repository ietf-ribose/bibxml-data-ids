      <t>This draft proposes a TDM emulation protocol for consideration by the PWE3 Working Group. The protocol defines methods for transporting DS3, E3, DS1, E1, and NxDS0 circuits over packet switched networks. It is based on ATM Circuit Emulation, but optimized for variable length packet networks. The intent is to provide a relatively simple but flexible method for transporting TDM signals over packet switched networks that also provides a path for interworking with ATM Circuit Emulation.</t>
