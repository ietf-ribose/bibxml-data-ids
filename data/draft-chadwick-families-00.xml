      <t>This document describes protocol support, in the form of LDAP controls, for compound entries. A compound entry logically allows collections of attributes to be grouped together as though they were present in the single compound entry, whereas in fact they are held in a hierarchical set of entries beneath the compound entry. The LDAP controls allow the user to treat a compound entry as either separate entries or as a single compound entry when both searching, retrieving and deleting information from the DIT. Compound entries are briefly described here and a full description of them can be found in the draft version of X.500 (2000)[FPDAM].</t>
