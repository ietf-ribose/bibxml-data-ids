      <t>This document describes protocol support, in the form of LDAPcontrols, for compound entries. A compound entry logically allowscollections of attributes to be grouped together as though they werepresent in the single compound entry, whereas in fact they are heldin a hierarchical set of entries beneath the compound entry. The LDAPcontrols allow the user to treat a compound entry as either separateentries or as a single compound entry when both searching, retrievingand deleting information from the DIT. Compound entries are brieflydescribed here and a full description of them can be found in thedraft version of X.500 (2000)[FPDAM].</t>
