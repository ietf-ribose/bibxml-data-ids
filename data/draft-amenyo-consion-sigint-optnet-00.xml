      <t>When one extrapolates from the ongoing evolutionary trends of IP router / switch development and its role in the build-out of optical core, edge, access and enterprise networks, it is reasonable to reach the almost inescapable conclusion that within a few years, there will be a complete physical separation of the commercial equipment embodying various concerns, aspects, roles and functions of data communications, Namely, 1. Separate equipment for transport (transmission, switching and multiplexing) and traffic forwarding. 2. Separate equipment concerned with control, signaling, traffic engineering, provisioning, protection and restoration control, as well as, traffic and flow management, (generalized 'softswitches'). 3. Separate equipment for network management, operations support, measurement &amp; metering, OAMP, inter-OSS, engineering management (including performance management, availability management, security management, accounting management), as well as life cycle support.</t>
