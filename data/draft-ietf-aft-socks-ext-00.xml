    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a command extension to the SOCKS Version 5 protocol which enables compliant clients to discover features supported by the server. After discovering the support of such features, the client may use them in subsequent connections to that server. This mechanism does not provide for negotiation; it is a way of instructing the client what features the server supports, not establishing which features the client supports or wishes to use.</t>
