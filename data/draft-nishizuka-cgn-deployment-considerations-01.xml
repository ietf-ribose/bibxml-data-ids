      <t>This document provides deployment considerations for Carrier-Grade- NAT (CGN). Due to emerging new web technologies such as Websocket, SPDY and HTTP2.0, the trend of the Internet traffic has been changing. The number of sessions of commonly-used applications were investigated to estimate the efficiency of IPv4 address sharing of CGN. Based on the result of the average number of sessions of subscribers, the verification of CGN was conducted in the large scale network experiment environment with one million emulated subscribers. It revealed that CGN can be used in more centralized location of a provider's network and it arose many considerations.</t>
