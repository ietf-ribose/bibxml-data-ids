      <t>Software Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV)have been creating paradigm shifts across major service providers, governments,and industries. In recent years, these two novel frameworks created jitters and excitements acrossmajor academic institutions and communities of practice. While these are considered disruptiveto major network infrastructures operating on status quo, SDN and NFV nonetheless bringnetwork resiliency, scalability, manageability, and, most importantly, lower long-term operationalexpenditures when implemented properly.They create opportunities for innovation that engage key players from networks,security, and software to develop new controllers, APIs, networks, and technologies. However,new innovations come with associated risks and security issues.This document aims to propose a formal security architecture that overarchesimportant aspects of SDN and NFV 's frameworks. This architecture, which is considered first to be proposedthru this draft, can be elaborated and modified as the frameworks mature overtime.</t>
