      <t>This proposal extends the PIM-DM [1] protocol specification by intro- ducing the PIM State-Refresh control message. When an (S,G) entry is created in a router for a directly connected source, if the interface directly connected to the source is the incoming interface for the entry, a new timer is started: the State- Refresh-Timer [SRT(S,G)]. The State-Refresh-Timer controls periodic transmission of the PIM State-Refresh message, which is propagated hop-by-hop down the (S,G) RPF tree. When received by a router on the RPF interface, the State-Refresh message causes existing prune state to be refreshed. Addition of this heartbeat message solves many of the current prob- lems with PIM-DM. It prevents the periodic timeout of prune state in routers, greatly reducing the re-flooding of multicast traffic down the pruned branches that expire periodically. It also causes topology changes to be realised quicker than the traditional 3 minute timeout.</t>
