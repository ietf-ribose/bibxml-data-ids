      <t>This draft describes the use of RSVP [RFC2205] with applications that do not have resource requirements that may not be readily quantifiable (qualitative applications). We introduce the \146qualitative\106 service-type. This service-type can be used in conjunction with RSVP signaling to manage the allocation of network resources to traffic originating from qualitative applications. This mode of RSVP usage is particularly applicable to networks that combine differentiated service (diff-serv) QoS mechanisms with RSVP signaling [intdiff].</t>
