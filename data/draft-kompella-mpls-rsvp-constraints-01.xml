      <t>Constraint-based routing is the computation of a path through a network that satisfies some constraints. Typically, some device A obtains the constraints (perhaps through configuration), and also knows the network topology and resources, and thereby computes the path. However, in certain cases, the device A that knows the constraints cannot compute the full path. In such cases, it is useful for A to be able to communicate the constraints to some other device B that can carry out or complete the computation, and moreover, to communicate these constraints in an extensible, interoperable fashion, and such that A's semantics are understood by B. This document suggests one such means of constraint communication: use a signalling mechanism (such as RSVP) for carrying the constraints, and carry the constraints as a program.</t>
