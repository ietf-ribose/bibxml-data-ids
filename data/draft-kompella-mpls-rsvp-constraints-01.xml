      <t>Constraint-based routing is the computation of a path through anetwork that satisfies some constraints. Typically, some device Aobtains the constraints (perhaps through configuration), and alsoknows the network topology and resources, and thereby computes thepath. However, in certain cases, the device A that knows theconstraints cannot compute the full path. In such cases, it isuseful for A to be able to communicate the constraints to some otherdevice B that can carry out or complete the computation, andmoreover, to communicate these constraints in an extensible,interoperable fashion, and such that A's semantics are understood byB. This document suggests one such means of constraintcommunication: use a signalling mechanism (such as RSVP) for carryingthe constraints, and carry the constraints as a program.</t>
