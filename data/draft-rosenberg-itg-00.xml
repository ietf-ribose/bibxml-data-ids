      <t>This memorandum discusses the issues and options involved in the design of a new transport protocol for multiplexed voice within a single packet. The intended application is the interconnection of devices which provide 'trunking' or long distance telephone service over the Internet. Such devices have many voice connections simultaneously between them. Multiplexing them into the same connection improves on the efficiency, enables the use of low bitrate voice codecs, and improves scalability. Options and issues concerning timestamping, payload type identification, length indication, and channel identification are discussed. Several possible header formats are identified, and their efficiencies are compared. This document is a product of the Audio-Video Transport working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at rem-conf@es.net and/or to the author(s).</t>
