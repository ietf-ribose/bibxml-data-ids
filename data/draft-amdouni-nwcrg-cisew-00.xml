    <abstract>
      <t>This document details an online coding method for network coding called CISEW: Coding Interval-based Sliding Encoding Window. The method is proposed as a building block that could be integrated in a complete network coding protocol. This building block is responsible of: - decoding: maintaining and decoding of the set of received coded payloads, - recoding: selecting the content of generated coded payloads, - signaling: allowing for nodes to collect the information on the state of their neighbors. CISEW is based on a sliding window method; it generates coded payloads using only a small subset of original payloads. This allows for some real-time decoding (online decoding). CISEW is a overhaul and redesign of a similar method called SEW, part of the previously proposed protocol DRAGONCAST. CISEW refines the signaling and algorithms of SEW, and makes them more general. CISEW offers a general framework for online network coding, with associated signaling. From this framework, several online coding policies can be implemented.</t>
