      <t>This document defines the DNS resolver (DNSR) option used to advertise on a link IPv6 addresses of DNS resolvers. The DNSR option, which lists the IPv6 addresses of DNS resolvers that all nodes of the link may use to resolve name or address, is attached to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Router Advertisement messages that are sent across a link. This document specifies the process used by a host to decide how to configure the IPv6 addresses of DNS resolvers that the host could use in IPv6 networks. This document defines the mechanism by which a node processes the DNSR option and updates valid IPv6 addresses of DNS resolvers.</t>
