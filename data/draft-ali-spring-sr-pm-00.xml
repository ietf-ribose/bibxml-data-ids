    <abstract>
      <t>RFC 6374 specifies protocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and accurate measurement of packet loss, one-way and two-way delay, as well as related metrics such as delay variation and channel throughput in MPLS networks. This document describes how these mechanisms can be used for performance measurements in Segment Routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) networks. The document also specifies how similar mechanisms can be used for performance measurement in Segment Routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6) networks.</t>
