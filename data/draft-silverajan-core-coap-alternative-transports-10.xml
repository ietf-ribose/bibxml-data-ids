    <abstract>
      <t>The aim of this document is to provide a way forward to best decide upon how alternative transport information can be expressed in a CoAP URI. This draft examines the requirements for a new URI format for representing CoAP resources over alternative transports. Various potential URI formats are presented. Benefits and drawbacks of embedding alternative transport information in various ways within the URI components are also discussed. From all listed formats, the document finds scheme-based model to be the most technically feasible.</t>
