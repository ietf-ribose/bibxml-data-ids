      <t>This document describes these new SDP "proto" attribute values: "QUIC", "QUIC/RTP/SAVP", "QUIC/RTP/AVPF", and "QUIC/RTP/SAVPF", and describes how SDP Offer/Answer can be used to set up an RTP connection using QUIC as a transport protocol. These proto values are necessary to allow the use of QUIC as an underlying transport protocol for applications that commonly use SDP as a session signaling protocol to set up RTP connections with UDP as its underlying transport protocol, such as SIP and WebRTC.</t>
