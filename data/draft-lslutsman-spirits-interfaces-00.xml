      <t>The SPIRITS physical architecture and the relevant background explanation of the mechanism for interactions between the PSTN and SPIRITS are provided in [1]. This document is attempted to take a next step and to describe all the SPIRITS interfaces necessary to support the following services defined in the WG charter: Internet Call Waiting (the leading SPIRITS benchmark service), Internet Caller-ID Delivery, and Internet Call Forwarding. The end-to-end implementation of charter services will require cooperation with ITU-T on the total protocol development. To this end this draft raises the discussion of the 'ownership' of protocols per SPIRIT interface.</t>
