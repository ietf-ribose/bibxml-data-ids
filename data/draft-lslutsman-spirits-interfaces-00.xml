      <t>The SPIRITS physical architecture and the relevant backgroundexplanation of the mechanism for interactions between the PSTN andSPIRITS are provided in [1]. This document is attempted to take anext step and to describe all the SPIRITS interfaces necessary tosupport the following services defined in the WG charter: InternetCall Waiting (the leading SPIRITS benchmark service), InternetCaller-ID Delivery, and Internet Call Forwarding. The end-to-endimplementation of charter services will require cooperation withITU-T on the total protocol development. To this end this draftraises the discussion of the 'ownership' of protocols per SPIRITinterface.</t>
