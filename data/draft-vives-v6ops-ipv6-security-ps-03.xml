      <t>Today, each network is often secured by a unique device (i.e. security gateway or firewall) that becomes a bottleneck for the end-to-end security model with IPv6. The deployment of IPv6 enabled devices and networks bring some issues, which must be addressed by security administrators in order to guarantee at least the same level of security that is obtained nowadays with IPv4 and network-based (including perimetral-based) security schemes, allowing at the same time all the IPv6 advantages.</t>
