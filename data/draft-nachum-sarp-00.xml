      <t>This document provides a recommended architecture and network operation named SARP. SARP is based on fast proxies that significantly reduce broadcast domains and ARP/ND broadcast transmissions. SARP supports smooth and fast virtual machine (VM) mobility without any modification to the VM, while keeping the connection up and running efficiently. SARP is targeted for massive scaling data centers with a significant number of VMs using ARP and ND protocols.</t>
