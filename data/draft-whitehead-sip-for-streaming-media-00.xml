      <t>This draft reviews requirements and evaluates solutions to improvethe integration of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)[RFC3261] to the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP and RTSP v2)[RFC 2326 and IDRTSP] especially in the context of converged mediaservices. The document develops a rationale and solution space for using SIP with streaming media applications. This is done by first considering use cases that are used to define generic requirementsto help compare the current and potentially new solutions. Therange of solutions is sketched out (at high-level) and advantages anddisadvantages discussed. The solutions evaluated address differentlevels of integration from SIP-only approaches to dual-protocolsolutions.</t>
