      <t>The use of certificates for authenticating the creation of IPsec security associations has long been fraught with difficulty. The specifications in IKE version 1 are sometimes ambiguous about important issues, and developers of IPsec systems are often unprepared to deal with the complexities of PKIX certificates and certificate handling. This document is a profile of certificate use in IPsec whose primary goal is to greatly increase interoperability while maintaining high security.</t>
