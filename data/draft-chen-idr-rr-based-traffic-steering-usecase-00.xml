      <t>Route Reflection based Traffic Steering (RRTS) is an idea that leverages the BGP route reflection mechanism to realize traffic steering in the network, therefore the operators can conduct their traffic to transmit/receive through specific nodes, domains and/or planes as demand. This document introduces the requirements and use cases of RRTS.</t>
