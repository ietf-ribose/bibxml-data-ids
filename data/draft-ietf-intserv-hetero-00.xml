      <t>Routers need not provide all services defined by the intserv WG. This will inevitably lead to heterogeneity in the set of services offered by network elements. How can we enable applications to obtain the end-to-end service they desire in the face of this heterogeneity? This document describes an approach involving replacement services and characterizations that builds end-to-end service out of heterogeneous per-link service offerings. This proposal was first described in [1], from whence much of the text was lifted.</t>
