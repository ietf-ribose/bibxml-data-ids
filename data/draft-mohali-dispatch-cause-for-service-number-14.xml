    <abstract>
      <t>RFC 4458 (regarding SIP URIs for applications) defines a "cause" URI parameter, which may appear in the Request-URI of a SIP request, that is used to indicate a reason why the request arrived to the User Agent Server (UAS) receiving the message. This document updates RFC 4458 by creating a new predefined value for the "cause" URI parameter to cover service number translation for cases of retargeting due to specific service action leading to the translation of a called service access number. This document also provides guidance, which was missing in RFC 4458, for using the "cause" URI parameter within the History-Info header field, since this use is mandatory in some IP networks' implementations.</t>
