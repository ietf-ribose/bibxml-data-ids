      <t>The introduction of persistent connections and pipelining into HTTP has resulted in potential performance benefits, but has also exposed the problem of head-of-line blocking.A simple, compatible, and optional extension to HTTP toallow a server to issue responses out of order couldsignificantly reduce HOL blocking. In this extension,clients add short ID fields to their requests, and serversecho these IDs back in their responses. This extension isdefined as a hop-by-hop rather than end-to-end mechanism,so it avoids much of the complexity of the end-to-endapproach.</t>
