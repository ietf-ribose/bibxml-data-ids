      <t>This memo discusses several framework issues related to Next Step In Signaling (NSIS) and mobility interaction. The first issue is related to handoff impact on NSIS operation. We present several general requirements for NSIS and mobility, followed by evaluation of how specific approaches using Mobile IP or other mechanisms might fit into the picture. Other issues covered include NSIS and mobility signaling layering and soft-state management.</t>
