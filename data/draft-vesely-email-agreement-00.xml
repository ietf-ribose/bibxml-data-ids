      <t>This draft proposes a way to standardize an agreement between a recipient and a sender, acknowledged by the recipient's MTA. The subject of the agreement expresses the willingness of the recipient to receive an identified, authenticated mail stream. After an MTA acknowledges the agreement, it will unconditionally accept complying messages, even if the recipient is not mentioned in any destination address field.</t>
