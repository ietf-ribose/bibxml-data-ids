      <t>This document describes LCC, a scalable layered congestion controlbuilding block for multicast. LCC is a combination of approaches thatallow multiple receivers to concurrently receive packets from a singlesender at varying rates depending on individual bandwidth connectionsand network conditions. Two basic goals of the approach are to alloweach receiver to obtain the full benefit of the available bandwidth tothe sender and to be fair to other flows in the network.</t>
