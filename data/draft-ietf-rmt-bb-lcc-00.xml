      <t>This document describes LCC, a scalable layered congestion control building block for multicast. LCC is a combination of approaches that allow multiple receivers to concurrently receive packets from a single sender at varying rates depending on individual bandwidth connections and network conditions. Two basic goals of the approach are to allow each receiver to obtain the full benefit of the available bandwidth to the sender and to be fair to other flows in the network.</t>
