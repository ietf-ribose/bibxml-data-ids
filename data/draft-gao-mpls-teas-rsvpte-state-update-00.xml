    <abstract>
      <t>RSVP-TE has the following advantages: source routing capability, and the ability to reserve resources hop by hop along the LSP path. RSVP takes a "soft state" approach to managing the reservation state in routers and hosts. The use of Refresh messages to cover many possible failures has resulted in a number of operational problems. One problem relates to scaling, another relates to the reliability and latency of RSVP Signaling. This document describes a number of mechanisms that can be used to reduce processing overhead requirements of refresh messages. These extension present no backwards compatibility issues.</t>
