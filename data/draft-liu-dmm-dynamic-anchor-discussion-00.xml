      <t>Distributed mobility management aims to distribute the mobility anchor to the access network level to avoid the centralized mobility anchor problem. By distributing the mobility anchor, the traffic can be distributed in an optimal way. There are many different proposals for DMM solution, one of those types of solution is called "dynamic anchor".
