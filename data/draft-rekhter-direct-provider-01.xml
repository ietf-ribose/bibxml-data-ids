      <t>Within the existing Internet routing architecture/protocols different hosts within a domain (autonomous system) usually can't control the choice of adjacent domains for forwarding of the inter-domain traffic originated by the hosts. In this document we describe a simple mechanism that provides hosts with such control. The proposed scheme can be realised with the existing technology, off-the shelf components, and minor tweaking of forwarding algorithm by border routers. The scheme doesn't require any new routing protocols.</t>
