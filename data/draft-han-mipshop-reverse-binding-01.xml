    <abstract>
      <t>This memo proposes a scheme that utilizes only pre-established bi- directional tunnels between LMA and MAGs to support a fast handover effectively in Proxy Mobile IPv6. To expedite the handover procedure, we define new signaling messages, Fast PBU/PBA and Reverse PBU/PBA, exchanged by LMA and MAGs. Because any signaling messages exchanged by two MAGs are neither created nor utilized and thus bi- directional tunnel between MAGs is not created, the proposed scheme puts less overload upon network than the existing fast handover scheme for PMIPv6. It can also tackle effectively with the so-called ping-pong movement of mobile nodes.</t>
