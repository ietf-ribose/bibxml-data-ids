      <t>This memo proposes a scheme that utilizes only pre-established bi-directional tunnels between LMA and MAGs to support a fast handovereffectively in Proxy Mobile IPv6. To expedite the handoverprocedure, we define new signaling messages, Fast PBU/PBA and ReversePBU/PBA, exchanged by LMA and MAGs. Because any signaling messagesexchanged by two MAGs are neither created nor utilized and thus bi-directional tunnel between MAGs is not created, the proposed schemeputs less overload upon network than the existing fast handoverscheme for PMIPv6. It can also tackle effectively with the so-calledping-pong movement of mobile nodes.</t>
