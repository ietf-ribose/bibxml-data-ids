    <abstract>
      <t>Data models provide a programmatic approach to represent services and networks. Concretely, they can be used to derive configuration information for network and service components, and state information that will be monitored and tracked. Data models can be used during the service and network management life cycle, such as service instantiation, provisioning, optimization, monitoring, diagnostic, and assurance. Data models are also instrumental in the automation of network management, and they can provide closed-loop control for adaptive and deterministic service creation, delivery, and maintenance. This document describes an architecture for service and network management automation that takes advantage of YANG modeling technologies. This architecture is drawn from a network operator perspective irrespective of the origin of a data module; it can thus accommodate modules that are developed outside the IETF.</t>
