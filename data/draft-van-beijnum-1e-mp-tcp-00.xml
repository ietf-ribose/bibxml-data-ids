      <t>Normal TCP/IP operation is for the routing system to select a bestpath that remains stable for some time, and for TCP to adjust to theproperties of this path to optimize throughput. A multipath TCPwould be able to either use capacity on multiple paths, ordynamically find the best performing path, and therefore reach higherthroughput. By adapting to the properties of several paths throughthe usual congestion control algorithms, a multipath TCP shifts itstraffic to less congested paths, leaving more capacity available fortraffic that can't move to another path on more congested paths. Andwhen a path fails, this can be detected and worked around by TCP muchmore quickly than by waiting for the routing system to repair thefailure.This memo specifies a multipath TCP that is implemented on thesending host only, without requiring modifications on the receivinghost.</t>
