      <t>During the initial deployment of IPv6, hosts in native IPv6 networkswill need to maintain connectivity with hosts and/or applications whocan only be reached through IPv4. The Dual Stack Transition Mechanism(DSTM) provides a method to assure this connectivity based on the useof IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnels and the temporal allocation of a globalIPv4 address to hosts requiring such communication. This documentdefines the processes and architecture required for this transitionmechanism.</t>
