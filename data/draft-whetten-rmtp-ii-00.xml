      <t>The Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol II, RMTP-II, is a reliable multicast protocol, designed to reliably and efficiently send data from a few senders to large groups of simultaneous recipients. It is designed primarily for use over controlled network topologies. It works over both symmetric networks, as well as over asymmetrical network topologies such as those provided by satellite, cable modem or Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) carriers. Before sending, each sender must connect with a trusted Top Node, to receive permission and control parameters for its data stream. The top node provides network managers with a single point of control for the senders, allowing them to monitor and control the traffic being sent.</t>
