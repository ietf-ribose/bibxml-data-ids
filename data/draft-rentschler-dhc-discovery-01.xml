      <t>The discovery mechanism described here is built upon and coexists with BOOTP according to RFC 1542 and DHCP according to RFC 2131 and RFC 3203. It allows server-initiated communication to specific or all clients in the network, using the DHCP packet format and with that the relay agent functionality. The Discovery Extensons are a powerful and flexible add-on to client-initiated DHCP that allow a variety of applications.</t>
