    <abstract>
      <t>The current version of the IDNA specifications anticipated that each new version of Unicode would be reviewed to verify that no changes had been introduced that required adjustments to the set of rules and, in particular, whether new exceptions or backward compatibility adjustments were needed. That review was conducted for Unicode 7.0.0 and identified a problematic new code point. This specification updates RFC 5982 to disallow that code point and provides information about the reasons why that exclusion is appropriate. It also applies an editorial clarification that was the subject of an earlier erratum.</t>
