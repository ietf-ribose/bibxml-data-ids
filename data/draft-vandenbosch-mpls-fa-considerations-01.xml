      <t>Forwarding adjacencies (FA) as described in [2] are a useful tool for improving the scalability of Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) Traffic Engineering (TE). Through the aggregation of TE LSPs this concept enables the creation of a TE-LSP Hierarchy. Forwarding adjacency LSPs (FA-LSP or simply FA) may be advertised as TE link into the same instance of ISIS/OSPF as the one that was used to create the LSP, allowing other LSRs to use FAs as TE-links for their path computation. As such, forwarding adjacency LSP have characteristics of both links and LSPs. This document list a number of topics for further study regarding forwarding adjacencies in an attempt to identify what future work may result in the MPLS WG (or other) from the link/LSP duality.</t>
