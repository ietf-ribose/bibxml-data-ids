      <t>The Gopher protocol is over twenty years old. Changing practices and unofficial extensions have caused Gopher as currently used to differ, but remain largely compatible with, the technical specifications first established in its first informational document, *The Internet Gopher Protocol (a distributed document search and retrieval protocol)*, known as *RFC 1436*. Therefore, this document attempts to establish a contemporary specification of the Gopher communications protocol, departing as little as possible from current practice.</t>
