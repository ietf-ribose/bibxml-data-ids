      <t>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a link-specific and load-dependent packet re-marking mechanism and provides in DifferentiatedServices networks feedback to egress nodes about load conditionswithin the domain. It is used to support admission control and flowtermination decision in a simple way. This document proposes how PCNmarks can be encoded into the IP header for packet-specific dualmarking (PSDM). PSDM encoding provides three different codepoints:not-ETM, not-ThM, and PM. Excess-traffic-marking may re-mark not-ETM-packets to PM and threshold-marking may re-mark not-ThM-packetsto PM.StatusThis memo is posted as an Internet-Draft with an intent to eventuallybe published as an experimental RFC.</t>
