      <t>This document defines a YANG data model for configuring and managing locally generated routes in a vendor-neutral way and based on operational best practice. Locally generated routes are those created by configuration, rather than by dynamic routing protocols. Such routes include static routes, locally created aggregate routes for reducing the number of constituent routes that must be advertised, summary routes for IGPs, etc.</t>
