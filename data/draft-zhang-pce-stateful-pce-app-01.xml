      <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides a solution for Traffic Engineering (TE) based path calculation in large, multi-domain, multi-region, or multi-layer networks. Depending on whether a PCE keeps information about LSPs and reserved resource usage in the network or not, it can be categorized as either stateful or stateless. This memo describes general considerations for stateful PCE(s) and examines its applicability through a number of typical scenarios. It shows how stateful PCE(s) can be applied to facilitate these applications. PCEP extensions required for stateful PCE usage are covered in separate document(s).</t>
