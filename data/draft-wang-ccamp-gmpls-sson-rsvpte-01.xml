      <t>A new architecture of optical transport networks which is addressed in the newest version of G.872 is being developed in ITU-T SG15. Compared with previous G.872 technology, this new technology allows the switch of group of optical channels as a whole. Since current control plane technology isn't able to control this kind of application, this document describes the signaling extension to support the control of frequency slot channel (i.e., group of optical channels). This document also addresses the interworking between WSON optical channel and SSON (Spectrum Switched Optical Network) optical channel.</t>
