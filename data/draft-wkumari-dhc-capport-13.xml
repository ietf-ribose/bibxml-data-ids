      <t>In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a captive portal mode. This highly restricts what the customer can do until the customer has authenticated. This document describes a DHCP option (and a RA extension) to inform clients that they are behind some sort of captive portal device, and that they will need to authenticate to get Internet Access. It is not a full solution to address all of the issues that clients may have with captive portals; it is designed to be used in larger solutions.
