    <abstract>
      <t>The Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS resource record type provides a mechanism for domains to express the allowed set of Certificate Authorities that may issue certificates for the domain. The core CAA specification ([RFC8659]) solely defines Property Tags that restrict the issuance of certificates that certify domain names; it does not define a mechanism for domains to restrict the issuance of certificates that include email addresses. This specification defines a Property Tag that grants authorization to Certificate Authorities to issue certificates which certify email addresses.</t>
