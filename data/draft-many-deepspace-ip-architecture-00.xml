      <t>Deep space communications involve long delays (e.g., Earth to Mars is 4-20 minutes) and intermittent communications, because of orbital dynamics. The IP protocol stack used on Internet is based on assumptions of shorter delays and mostly uninterrupted communications. This document describes the architecture of the IP protocol stack tailored for its use in deep space. It involves buffering IP packets in IP forwarders facing intermittent links, signaling buffer storage near capacity, adjusting transport protocols configuration and application protocols timers. This architecture applies to Moon, Mars or in general interplanetary networking.</t>
