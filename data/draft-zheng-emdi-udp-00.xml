      <t>A Media Delivery Index (MDI) measurement that can be used as a diagnostic tool or a quality indicator for monitoring flows that are sensitive to arrival time and packet loss is defined in [RFC4445]. This document extends the Media Delivery Index with a new component: Effective Loss Factor (ELF), which takes loss distribution into account when measuring packet loss. ELF is also applicable when certain Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes are used.</t>
