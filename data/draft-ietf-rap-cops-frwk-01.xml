      <t>This document describes an architecture for a COPS based Policy Control Management System Framework. The architecture is designed to be modular, allowing future modification and addition to existing framework. The major units of the architecture are the Policy Decision Points (PDP), the Access Edge Policy Enforcement Points (AE_PEP), the Core Policy Enforcement Points (C_PEP). With Message Processing Subsystem, Security Subsystem, Framework Data Model Subsystem, and Application Specific Data Model Subsystem in each PDP and PEP. This document further provides a high level description of each unit and describes the relationship among each unit. This document also describes how the subsystems within each unit interact with each other to provide the functionality of a Policy Control Management System.</t>
