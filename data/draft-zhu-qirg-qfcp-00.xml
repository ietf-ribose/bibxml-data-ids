    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the Quantum Four-Wave Mixing Control Protocol (QFCP), a lightweight transport protocol designed to operate over UDP in IP optical environments. QFCP enables the transmission of control- plane parameters required for quantum four-wave mixing (FWM) processes and associated optical configurations, including polarization stabilization, timestamp alignment, ROADM port selection, and spectral parameters. The protocol uses a Type-Length- Value (TLV) structure to support versioning and extensibility. This work is motivated by recent demonstrations of a classical-decisive quantum internet using integrated photonics.</t>
