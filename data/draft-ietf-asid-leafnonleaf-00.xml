    <abstract>
      <t>Applications of X.500, LDAP, and similar directory services need to be able to efficiently and unambiguously determine if an entry is a leaf entry (no entries exist beneath the entry) or a non-leaf entry (entries do exist beneath the entry). While some implementations use proprietary object classes to allow directory clients to make the distinction, there is no standard defined. This document defines two object classes that may be used by all implementations to allow directory clients to distinguish leaf entries from non-leaf entries.</t>
