    <abstract>
      <t>The traditional "castle-and-moat" security paradigm is no longer effective for some emerging scenarios, such as cloud services, remote workforces and intelligent agents. Zero trust (ZT) has emerged as the new paradigm, holding on the "never trust, always verify" principle, treats every single access request as untrudted and requires veficication. While a high-level atchitectural guidance exists, notably from NIST in SP 800-207 where thtenants of zero trust are well interperated, the industry lacks the open, interoperable framework and protocol necessary for building multi-vendor zero trust practice enrironment. This document presents the problem statement for zero trust interoperability, outlines the key use cases, and argue for the need for standardization in the IETF. It discusses the possible scope for zero trust standardization work in the IETF, identifying which aspects are well suited for the IETF protocols and which are better addressed by other bodies. The aim of this document is to initiate a discussion in the IETF community on the necessity and prospective of promoting zero trust related work here.</t>
