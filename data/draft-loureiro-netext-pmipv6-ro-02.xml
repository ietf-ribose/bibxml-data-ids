      <t>The IETF specified Proxy Mobile IPv6 as protocol for network-based mobility management. In Proxy Mobile IPv6, mobile nodes are attached to the network through Mobility Access Gateways and registered with a Local Mobility Anchor. Traffic from and to the mobile node traverses the mobile node's Local Mobility Anchor, irrespective of the location of the mobile node's corresponding communication endpoint. This document specifies a protocol extension to Proxy Mobile IPv6 which allows the set up and maintenance of a localized routing path between two communicating mobile nodes' Mobility Access Gateways without traversing the mobile nodes' Local Mobility Anchor(s). The protocol component of a rendezvous control point ensures stable maintenance of routing states during handover in scenarios with multiple mobility anchors, where states for the two communication endpoints are distributed between these anchors.</t>
