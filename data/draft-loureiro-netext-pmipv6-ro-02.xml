      <t>The IETF specified Proxy Mobile IPv6 as protocol for network-basedmobility management. In Proxy Mobile IPv6, mobile nodes are attachedto the network through Mobility Access Gateways and registered with aLocal Mobility Anchor. Traffic from and to the mobile node traversesthe mobile node's Local Mobility Anchor, irrespective of the locationof the mobile node's corresponding communication endpoint. Thisdocument specifies a protocol extension to Proxy Mobile IPv6 whichallows the set up and maintenance of a localized routing path betweentwo communicating mobile nodes' Mobility Access Gateways withouttraversing the mobile nodes' Local Mobility Anchor(s). The protocolcomponent of a rendezvous control point ensures stable maintenance ofrouting states during handover in scenarios with multiple mobilityanchors, where states for the two communication endpoints aredistributed between these anchors.</t>
