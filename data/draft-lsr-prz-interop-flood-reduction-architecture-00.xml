    <abstract>
      <t>In case multiple distributed (including a possible centralized one) flood reduction algorithms are deployed at the same time in an IGP domain the correctness of the overall solution preconditions certain co-operative behavior of involved algorithms. Under such conditions the correctness of the overall solution can be derived from resulting graph theoretical concepts easily. This document presents the necessary requirements on the deployed algorithms and the resulting framework. The situation of multiple algorithms in the network in steady state is per se not necessarily operationally desirable but must be, if minimal network disruption during such procedure is required, solved for possible migration scenarios caused by e.g. discovered defects or algorithm improvements.</t>
