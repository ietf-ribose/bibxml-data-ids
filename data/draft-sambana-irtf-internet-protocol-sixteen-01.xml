      <t>The present invention Internet Protocol Version 16 (IPv16) service for allowing relates to the creation of an extended new version of Internet Protocol version 16 and its supports to current technologies and future technologies too without any interrupt. I propose New Internet Protocol version for technology upgradation and limitless end user connectivity and create new classes F and Class H, and Class I for extended to present classes and its performed Public, private, protected environment access with UWW for at the User Level, it is performed to operate both I and H Classes for Unlimited and Infinity High Security with multicast and Virtual IP address each block connectivity for an universal users and interstellar and expand universe users allocations. IP Address is run single IP address inherited desired Sub-IP address and extended upto X power n with Virtual IP and IP subsequences upto 2 power of x-n,proposed new series of 1024.1024.1024.1024 and VirtualIP works similar current way,and introduce Universal Wide Web (UWW) also Communicate Interstellar objects and Galaxies using Radio Signals are integrated with the proposed architecture, and Virtual IP - IPv16 to expand the internal space communications very quickly with secured allocated channels. Secured allocated individualrecognized block channels are connected with Internet and resolve tointerrupt signals and message transfer delayed problem, transfer data with secure way along with working mechanism the same existing technologies and IPv16 will adapt identifiedand undefined problems of IPv6 computer technology and network transmission problems to resolve the gaps between IPv6 to IPv16 and supports upcoming future technologies and versions too.</t>
