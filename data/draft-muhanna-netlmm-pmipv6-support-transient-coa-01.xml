      <t>In order for the local mobility anchor to receive and forward uplinktraffic for a mobile node, Proxy Mobile IPv6 base protocol mandatesthe LMA to have an active BCE with a registered proxy CoA that is theother end of the tunnel between the LMA and MAG. In some systems andduring active inter-MAG handoff with traffic that is sensitive todelay and packet loss, the LMA is required to forward uplink trafficfor the mobile node from the target MAG without completely switchingthe tunnel from the source MAG. This document specifies a mechanismwhich allows the target MAG to perform transient registration for anew proxy CoA and the LMA to create a transient BCE for the samemobile node for a specified period of time while maintaining theoriginal mobile node's BCE which reference the old pCoA at the sourceMAG.</t>
