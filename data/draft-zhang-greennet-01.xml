      <t>Energy consumption of network infrastructures is rising fast. There are emerging needs for power-aware routing and traffic engineering, which adjust routing paths to help reduce power consumption network- wide. This document gives a high-level analysis on the basic requirements, approaches, and potential issues in power-aware routing and traffic engineering.</t>
