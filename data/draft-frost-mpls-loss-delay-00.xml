      <t>Many service provider service level agreements (SLAs) depend on theability to measure and monitor performance metrics for packet lossand one-way and two-way delay, as well as related metrics such asdelay variation and channel throughput. This capability, inaddition, provides operators with greater visibility into theperformance characteristics of their networks, thereby facilitatingplanning, troubleshooting, and evaluation. This document specifiesprotocol mechanisms to enable the efficient and accurate measurementof these performance metrics in MPLS networks.</t>
