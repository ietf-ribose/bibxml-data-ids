      <t>The combination of "rn" and "npdi" parameters which are normally usedfor number portability (NP) can also solve numbering and routingproblems. Database dips to obtain routing numbers are not onlyneeded for NP, but also for the routing of service numbers and shortcode numbers in the PSTN and also in SIP networks. This documentdefines the use of the tel URI parameters defined for NP ("rn" and"npdi") to route service numbers and short code numbers.</t>
