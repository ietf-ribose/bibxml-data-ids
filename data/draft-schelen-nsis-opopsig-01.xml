      <t>The NSIS Work group will develop the requirements, architecture andprotocols for the next IETF steps on signaling. Two approaches for asignaling model have been discussed: path-coupled and path-decoupled(previously denoted as on-path and off-path). This draft provides aconceptual comparison between path-coupled and path-decoupledsignaling together with reasons for why an NSIS protocol should bedesigned to support both cases. The collection of data objects to becarried by the protocol should basically be the same in both casesand will evolve over time as new usages for NSIS protocol areidentified. The differences between the two flavors of this NSISprotocol are then explained.</t>
