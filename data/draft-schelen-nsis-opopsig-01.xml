      <t>The NSIS Work group will develop the requirements, architecture and protocols for the next IETF steps on signaling. Two approaches for a signaling model have been discussed: path-coupled and path-decoupled (previously denoted as on-path and off-path). This draft provides a conceptual comparison between path-coupled and path-decoupled signaling together with reasons for why an NSIS protocol should be designed to support both cases. The collection of data objects to be carried by the protocol should basically be the same in both cases and will evolve over time as new usages for NSIS protocol are identified. The differences between the two flavors of this NSIS protocol are then explained.</t>
