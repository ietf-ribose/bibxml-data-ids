      <t>This document describes the applicability of the reliable server poolarchitecture and protocols to applications which want to have Highavialebility services. This is accomplished by using redundantservers and failover between servers of the same pool in case ofserver failure. Processing load in a pool may de distributed/sharedbetween the members of the pool according to a certain policy. Alsosome guidance is given on the choice of underlying transport protocol(and corresponding transport protocol mapping) for transportingapplication data and Rserpool specific control data.</t>
