      <t>This document looks at games and their use on computers, where they have been and where they are going, their relationship to the Internet and its eventual to communicate for multi-player capability. The document solicits input on, and proposes creating, a generic standard for game protocols and other systems that generate real-time and transaction-based traffic. If such a standard for transaction-based traffic exists, other applications may be able to use it, and server programs to handle processing of multi-user games may then be possible.</t>
