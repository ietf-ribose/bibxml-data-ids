      <t>The purpose of the draft is to provide mechanisms to discover all nodes and addresses on an IPv6 network. Network discovery is a key to network management and network security. In IPv4 the most effective way to discover what devices were attached to the network was to walk the entire network address space. While this was easily done in IPv4, it is impossible in IPv6, due to the large range of addresses on a network. Currently there is no effective way to discover the nodes on an IPv6 network. This document describes the changes that need to be made to allow for discovering nodes on an IPv6 network.</t>
