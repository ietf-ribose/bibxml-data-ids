    <abstract>
      <t>Domain Name System Resource Records are identified in part by their class. The class field is not effective, and it is not used the way it appears to have been intended. This memo makes no recommendation about the DNS parameters registry, but urges those defining new RRTYPEs to define them for all classes.</t>
