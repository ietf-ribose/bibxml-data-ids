      <t>This document proposes an extension to SIP for subscriptions and notifications of user presence. User presence is defined as the willingness and ability of a user to communicate with other users on the network. Historically, presence has been limited to 'on-line' and 'off-line' indicators; the notion of presence here is broader.</t>
