      <t>This document specifies alternative Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Block-Wise transfer options: Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options. These options are similar to, but distinct from, the CoAP Block1 and Block2 Options defined in RFC 7959. Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options are not intended to replace Block1 and Block2 Options, but rather have the goal of enabling faster transmission rates for large amounts of data with fewer packet interchanges. Also, the Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options support faster recovery should any of the blocks get lost in transmission.</t>
