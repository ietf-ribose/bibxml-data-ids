      <t>Traditionally, the User Services Area of the IETF has been responsible for keeping FYI documents updated. However, as the Internet has progressed and developed, it has become clear that not all FYIs are worth updating. Some of the information is simply obsolete. This memo documents which FYIs are considered obsolete, and lets users know not to trust the information they contain.</t>
