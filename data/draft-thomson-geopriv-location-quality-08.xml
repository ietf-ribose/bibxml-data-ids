      <t>Parameters that define the expected quality of location information are defined for use in location protocols. These parameter can be used by a requester to indicate to a Location Server quality requirements for the location information that is requested. The Location Server is able to use this information to control how location information is determined. An optional indication of whether the quality requirements were met is defined to be provided by the Location Server alongside location information.</t>
