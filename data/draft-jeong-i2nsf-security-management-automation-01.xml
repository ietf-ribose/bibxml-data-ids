    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an extension of the framework of Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF) for Security Management Automation (SMA) in cloud-based security services. The security management automation in this document deals with a security polity translation and a feedback-based security service enforcement. To support these two features in SMA, this document specifies an augmented architecture of the I2NSF framework with a new system component and a new interface.</t>
