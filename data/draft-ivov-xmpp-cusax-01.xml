    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes current practices for combined use of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). Such practices aim to provide a single fully featured real-time communication service by using complementary subsets of features from each of the protocols. Typically such subsets would include telephony capabilities from SIP and instant messaging and presence capabilities from XMPP. This specification does not define any new protocols or syntax for either SIP or XMPP. However, implementing it may require modifying or at least reconfiguring existing client and server-side software. Also, it is not the purpose of this document to make recommendations as to whether or not such combined use should be preferred to the mechanisms provided natively by each protocol like for example SIP's SIMPLE or XMPP's Jingle. It merely aims to provide guidance to those who are interested in such a combined use.</t>
