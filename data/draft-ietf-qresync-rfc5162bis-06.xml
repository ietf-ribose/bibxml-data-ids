      <t>Often, multiple IMAP (RFC 3501) clients need to coordinate changes to a common IMAP mailbox. Examples include different clients working on behalf of the same user, and multiple users accessing shared mailboxes. These clients need a mechanism to synchronize state changes for messages within the mailbox. The Conditional Store facility allows a client to quickly resynchronize mailbox flag changes. The Conditional Store facility also provides a protected update mechanism for message state information that can detect and resolve conflicts between multiple writing mail clients. For example, the mechanism can be used to guarantee that only one client can change message state at any time. This document additionally defines another IMAP extension, which gives an IMAP client the ability to quickly resynchronize any previously opened mailbox as part of the SELECT/EXAMINE command, without the need for server-side state or additional client round- trips. That extension builds on top of the Conditional Store extension and covers message deletions in addition to flag changes.</t>
