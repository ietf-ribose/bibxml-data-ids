      <t>In the past Mandatory Access Control(MAC) systems have used veryrigid policies which were hardcoded into the particular protocol andplatform. As MAC systems are more widely deployed additionalflexibility in mechanism and policy is required. Where traditionaltrusted systems implemented Multi-Level Security and integritymodels, modern systems have expanded to include technologies such astype enforcement. Due to the wide range of policies and mechanismsit has proven through past efforts to be virtually impossible toaccomodate all parties in one security label format and model.To accomodate multiple MAC mechanisms and label formats this documentproposes a registry of label format specifications. This registrycontains several identifiers to accomodate both integer and stringpreferences and associates those identifiers with an extensivedocument outlining the exact syntax and use of the particular labelformat.</t>
