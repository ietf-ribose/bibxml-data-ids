      <t>Unwanted Email ('SPAM') is a constantly growing scourge of the Internet. SPAM takes full advantage of the open system that was created in the spirit of cooperation that represents the original underpinnings of the Internet. Understanding that making airtight mail systems without completely destroying old software, the authors of this proposal considered the continued operation of these legacy systems while tightening up the current standards. This new proposal calls for a new DNS resource record type and a new standard of operation for organization mail- exchangers. Using this new resource record along with other standard DNS resources provides system operators to minimize exploitable inbound SPAM pathways into their systems.</t>
