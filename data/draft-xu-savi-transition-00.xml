      <t>SAVI Working Group is developing standardize mechanisms that prevent nodes attached to the same IP link from spoofing each other's IP addresses, and achieve IP source address validation at a finer granularity. Unfortunately, up to now, SAVI switch only works under the scenario of pure wire/wireless IPv6 Ethernet access subnet. In the current stage of IPv4/IPv6 transition which can't be cross over, SAVI has to make more progress to adapt it. This document describes the requirements and gives tentative solutions for the SAVI in IP4/IPv6 transition period. In RFC5565, Wu et.al proposal a softwire mesh framework to address the problem of routing information and data packets of one protocol how to pass through a single-protocol network of the other protocol. According to the real situation of CNGI-CERNET and China Telecom, document takes scenario of IPv4 packets transit IPv6 network into account.</t>
