      <t>This memo aims to improve Mobile IPv6 protocol security by enabling an enhanced care-of address rechability test for the home agent. The main goals are to discourage a rogue mobile node from misleading its home agent to flood a targeted foreign network and to empower the latter to thwart this type of attack if launched at a later stage.</t>
