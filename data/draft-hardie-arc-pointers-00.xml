    <abstract>
      <t>In RFC 2826, the IAB set out the benefits of a globally unique public name space. As alternative contexts of resolution emerge, such as those implied by RFC 7686, maintaining a single namespace for the Internet requires a method to indicate the context of resolution for a name. This document proposes a registry for such alternative resolution contexts as well as a set of pointer resource record types useful for allowing conformant resolvers which query for the name in the DNS to be redirected to the appropriate alternative resolution context.</t>
