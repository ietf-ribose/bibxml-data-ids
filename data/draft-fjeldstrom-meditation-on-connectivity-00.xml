    <abstract>
      <t>This document analyzes how the Internet arrived at its current connectivity equilibrium. It does not propose new mechanisms or assign fault, but instead examines a series of historically contingent, locally rational adaptations (particularly the adoption of default-deny security boundaries alongside the pressures of global scaling) that collectively shaped today's reliance on higher-layer compensatory mechanisms. It clarifies how sustained operational triage and successful adaptation deferred reconsideration of endpoint semantics, and why the accumulated effects of those decisions are now observable at Internet scale.</t>
