    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a framework for the transport of IP traffic from different routing realms inside a single network. In other words, this document describes a framework enabling a network operator to enable the parallel use of different IP routing realms within a single operated network. This framework may, for instance, be applied in the context of IPv4 private networks using an address reuse technology to offer internet connectivity or in the context of IPv4 and IPv6 interworking/migration. Till now, operating multiple realms within a single physical network was realised by the use of tunneling technologies. This document will introduce a non-tunnel based scheme for multiple realms interworking.</t>
