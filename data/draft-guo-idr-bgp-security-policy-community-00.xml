    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a set of standardized BGP communities to signal inter-AS routing security policy intent. Current mechanisms such as ROA [RFC6482] [RFC9582] and ASPA [ASPA-Profile] [ASPA-Verification] provide validation outcomes, but leave "NotFound" or "Unknown" states operationally ambiguous. This document defines transitive communities that allow an Origin AS to explicitly express its security policy expectations, such as a preference for strict handling of ROA or ASPA validation ambiguity, to downstream Autonomous Systems (AS). Unlike validation states, these communities do not assert correctness or authorization. Instead, they communicate origin-declared policy intent to all downstream ASes, enabling them to correlate this intent with locally derived validation results. By enabling explicit signaling of security expectations without exporting validation state, this mechanism allows downstream ASes to make more informed policy decisions while reducing the risk of accidental outages caused by misinterpretation of ambiguous validation outcomes. This mechanism is orthogonal to existing routing security validation technologies and does not alter their semantics or deployment models.</t>
