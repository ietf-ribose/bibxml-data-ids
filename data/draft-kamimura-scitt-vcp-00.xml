      <t>This document defines a SCITT (Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust) profile for creating tamper-evident audit trails of AI- driven algorithmic trading decisions and executions. The VeritasChain Protocol (VCP) extends the SCITT architecture to address the specific requirements of financial markets, including nanosecond- precision timestamps, regulatory compliance with EU AI Act and MiFID II, and privacy-preserving mechanisms (crypto-shredding) for GDPR compliance. This profile defines how VCP events are encoded as SCITT Signed Statements, registered with Transparency Services, and verified using COSE Receipts.</t>
