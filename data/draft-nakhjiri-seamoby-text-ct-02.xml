      <t>This document presents a context transfer proposal that allows completion of context transfer outside timing critical message sequence for handover. The context transfer process is initiated at a moment of MN’s choice (in regard to layer 2 and 3 handover and MN’s traffic) and is completed without a disruption in the flow of MN’s real time traffic. This proposal is in line with the current fast handover framework within Mobile IP WG [3]. Although this document provides a specific recommendation, the framework proposed here, along with multiple alternatives that are mentioned, provides a great amount of flexibility in detailed design of context transfer. A minimum reliability mechanism for ensuring quality of transferred context is added to provide context updates that cannot be achieved by any transport protocol.</t>
