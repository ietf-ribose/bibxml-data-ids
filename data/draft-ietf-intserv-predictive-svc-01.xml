      <t>This memo describes the network element behavior required to deliver Predictive service in the Internet. Predictive service is a real-time service that provides low packet loss and a fairly reliable delay bound. This service is intended for applications that are tolerant of occasional late arriving packets, but require substantial and quantified levels of delay control from the network. Predictive service is very similar to Controlled Delay service, and the two specifications have a fair amount of shared language. The main salient different between the two services is that Predictive service offers a delay bound and Controlled Delay does not. If no characterizations are provided, then Predictive service is, from an application's perspective, almost indistinguishable from Controlled Delay; the delay bounds are of little use if the endpoints are not aware of them. Thus, the distinction between Predictive and Controlled Delay is important only in contexts where characterizations are made available to endpoints. This specification follows the service specification template described in [1].</t>
