      <t>This document defines the format and content of bitmap, cursor and icon images as are commonly used under the Graphical User Interface used on Personal Computers which is sold under the trade name of 'Microsoft Windows'. They are defined here in order to add three new MIME specifications for bitmaps and for icon files when these documents are transported by E-mail, because the format used by those files as described by this document is device independent, and thus should be usable by other Graphical User Interfaces. There is an RFC (0797) defining bitmaps, but it is deficient for covering bitmaps containing color, or for Icons or Cursors, which can be transparent or inverse colored to the background they are placed against. Suggestions on topics this document could cover if it becomes issued as an Internet RFC, in addition to corrections or oversights, are invited, as well as points that need to be covered for RFCs which are pending at the time this document is issued.</t>
