      <t>This document describes Netlink2, which is an extension of Linux Netlink [Netlink]. This document is intended as a proposal for the ForCES IETF working group protocol. ForCES attempts to define a clear separation between the two enti- ties of the NE in order to have them evolve separetely as opposed to the current monolithic evolution.</t>
