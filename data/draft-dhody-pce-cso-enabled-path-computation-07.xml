      <t>Applications like cloud computing, video gaming, HD Video streaming, Live Concerts, Remote Medical Surgery, etc are offered by Data Centers. These data centers are geographically distributed and connected via a network. Many decisions are made in the Application space without any concern of the underlying network. Cross stratum application/network optimization focus on the challenges and opportunities presented by data center based applications and carriers networks together [CSO-DATACNTR]. Constraint-based path computation is a fundamental building block for traffic engineering systems such as Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) networks. [RFC4655] explains the architecture for a Path Computation Element (PCE)-based model to address this problem space. This document explains the architecture for CSO enabled Path Computation.</t>
