    <abstract>
      <t>Most of the message types defined by the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) make provision for data in TLV format. However, Route Monitoring messages (which provide a snapshot of the monitored Routing Information Base) and Peer Down messages (which indicate that a peering session was terminated) do not. Supporting (optional) data in TLV format across all BMP message types allows for a homogeneous and extensible structure that would be useful for the most different use-cases that need to convey additional data to a BMP station. While it is not intended for this document to cover any specific utilization scenario, it defines a consistent and simple way to support TLV data in all message types.</t>
