      <t>The distribution of BGP routing information within an autonomoussystem requires all border routers to be fully meshed. Thisconstitutes a significant operational problem in terms ofconfiguration management.This has led to the wide-spread adoption of route reflection[RFC2796], primarily in order to reduce the number systems whichconfiguration must be modified in order to introduce or remove a newinternal BGP speaker. Route reflection, however, implies with itinformation reduction which is not always desired.This document defines a discovery mechanism that is designed toaddress the problem of introducing (or removing) a BGP speaker intoan iBGP mesh without implying any other behavior change when comparedto manual configuration.</t>
