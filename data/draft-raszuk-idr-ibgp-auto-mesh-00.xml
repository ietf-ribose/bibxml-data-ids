      <t>The distribution of BGP routing information within an autonomous system requires all border routers to be fully meshed. This constitutes a significant operational problem in terms of configuration management. This has led to the wide-spread adoption of route reflection [RFC2796], primarily in order to reduce the number systems which configuration must be modified in order to introduce or remove a new internal BGP speaker. Route reflection, however, implies with it information reduction which is not always desired. This document defines a discovery mechanism that is designed to address the problem of introducing (or removing) a BGP speaker into an iBGP mesh without implying any other behavior change when compared to manual configuration.</t>
