      <t>Historically, there has often been a perceived distinction between "standard" and "non-standard" parameters (such as media types and header fields), by prefixing the latter with the string "X-" or similar constructions (e.g., "x."). In practice, this convention causes more problems than it solves. Therefore, this document deprecates the "X-" convention for most application protocol parameters.</t>
