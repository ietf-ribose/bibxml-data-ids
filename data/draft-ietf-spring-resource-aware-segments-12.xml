    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the mechanism to allocate network resources to one or a set of Segment Routing Identifiers (SIDs). Such SIDs are referred to as resource-aware SIDs. The resource-aware SIDs retain their original forwarding semantics, with the additional semantics to identify the set of network resources available for the packet processing and forwarding action. A list of resource-aware SIDs can be used to allow an SR Policy to use a specific set of network resources, and a group of resource-aware SIDs can be used to represent a virtual network with a specific set of reserved network resources. The proposed mechanism is applicable to both segment routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</t>
