      <t>[RFC4456] asserts that, because the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)cost to a given point in the network will vary across routers, "theroute reflection approach may not yield the same route selectionresult as that of the full IBGP mesh approach." One practicalimplication of this assertion is that the deployment of routereflection may thwart the ability to achieve hot potato routing. Hotpotato routing attempts to direct traffic to the closest AS egresspoint in cases where no higher priority policy dictates otherwise.As a consequence of the route reflection method, the choice of exitpoint for a route reflector and its clients will be the egress pointclosest to the route reflector - and not necessarily closest to theRR clients.Section 11 of [RFC4456] describes a deployment approach and a set ofconstraints which, if satsified, would result in the deployment ofroute reflection yielding the same results as the iBGP full meshapproach. Such a deployment approach would make route reflectioncompatible with the application of hot potato routing policy.As networks evolved to accommodate architectural requirements of newservices, tunneled (LSP/IP tunneling) networks with centralized routereflectors became commonplace. This is one type of common deploymentwhere it would be impractical to satisfy the constraints described inSection 11 of [RFC4456]. Yet, in such an environment, hot potatorouting policy remains desirable.This document proposes two new solutions which can be deployed tofacilitate the application of closest exit point policy centralizedroute reflection deployments.</t>
