    <abstract>
      <t>BGP is used as the only routing protocol in some networks today. In such networks, it is useful to get a detailed view of the nodes and underlying links in the topology along with their attributes similar to one available when using link state routing protocols. Such a view of a BGP-only fabric enables use cases like traffic engineering and forwarding of services along paths other than the BGP best path selection. This document defines extensions to the BGP Link-state address-family (BGP-LS) and the procedures for advertisement of the topology in a BGP-only network. It also describes a specific use-case for traffic engineering based on Segment Routing.</t>
