      <t>This document explores issues with Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) that result from the use of various encoding schemes such as UTF-8 and the ASCII-Compatible Encoding produced by the Punycode algorithm. It focuses on the importance of agreeing on a single encoding and how complicated the state of affairs ends up being as a result of using different encodings today.</t>
