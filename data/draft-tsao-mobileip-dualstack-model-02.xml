    <abstract>
      <t>To support IP mobility, mobile IPv4 was designed for IPv4 network and the mobility extension for IPv6 has been also drafted. However, mobile IPv4 and mobile IPv6 are not compatible to each other so that a mobile IPv4 host can not function properly while it changes its point of attachment to IPv6 networks and vice versa. The document specifies an architecture and mechanisms to solve mobility problems in IPv4 and IPv6 interconnected networks. The solution presents a dual stack model that implements a new address mapper on mobile hosts. The address mapper on a mobile host associates the home address in one protocol such as IPv4 with a care-of-address in the other protocol, i.e. IPv6. It dispatches IPv4/IPv6 packets to proper layers of the protocol stack, and provides transparent services to upper layers regardless of the attached networks. Therefore, the new architecture facilitates the mobility of hosts in IPv4 and IPv6 interconnected networks.</t>
