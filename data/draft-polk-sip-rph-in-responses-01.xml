      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Resource-Priority Header is ignored in SIP responses, according to RFC 4412. This was adesign choice during RFC 4412's development. This is now considered a bad design choice in certain scenarios. This document corrects RFC 4412's communications model by optionally allowing a SIP server or user agent (UA) to process the Resource-Priority Header in a response.The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</t>
