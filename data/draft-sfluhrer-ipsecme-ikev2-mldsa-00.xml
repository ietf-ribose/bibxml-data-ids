      <t>One IPsec area that would be impacted by Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) is IKEv2 authentication based on traditional asymmetric cryptograph algorithms: e.g RSA, ECDSA; which are widely deployed authentication options of IKEv2. NIST has recently standardized ML-DSA, which is a signature algorithm believed to be secure against Quantum Computers. This document describes how to use ML-DSA with IKEv2 as an auhentication scheme.</t>
