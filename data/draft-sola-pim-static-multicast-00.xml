    <abstract>
      <t>The Protocol Independent Multicast - Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) is currently defined as an intra-domain multicast protocol. Although in PIM-SM more than one Candidate Rendezvous Point (C-RP) may exist, only one can be active at a given time, and this will be the one to which receivers will send Join messages or sources will send Register messages. The method used in PIM-SM to make public the set of C-RPs for a multicast group is to flood all over the domain packets with the list of C-RPs using the so-called Bootstrap method. This approach may scale in domains with few routers but does not scale if the protocol would have to be applied to provide multicast throughout the whole internet. In this draft we specify the modifications needed in PIM-SM in order to support more than one active RP simultaneously, and also show how Static Multicast can be used to make public in an scalable way the information regarding RPs as well as the IP multicast address for the multicast group. In the presence of more than one source, having more than one RP and placing them according to sources and receivers' distribution on the internet will reduce the average number of hops from sources to receivers, and will also improve the multicast protocol's fault tolerance.</t>
