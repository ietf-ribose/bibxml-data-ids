      <t>The proposed change to the initial window to 10 indraft-ietf-tcpm- initcwnd must be considered deeply harmful; not because it is the proposed change is evil taken in isolation, but that other changes in web browsers and web sites that have occurred over the last decade, it makes the problem of transient congestion at a user's broadband connection two and a half times worse. This result has been hidden by the already widespread bufferbloat present in broadband connections. Packet loss in isolation is no longer a useful metric of a path's quality. The very drive to improve latency of web page rendering is already destroying other low latency applications, such as VOIP and gaming, and will prevent reliable rich web real time web applications such as those contemplated by the IETF rtcweb working group.</t>
