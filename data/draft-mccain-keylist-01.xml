    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a system by which an OpenPGP client may subscribe to an organization's keylist to keep its internal keystore up-to-date. Ensuring that all members of an organization have their colleagues' most recent PGP public keys is critical to maintaining operational security. Without the most recent keys and a source of trust for those keys (as this document specifies), users must manually update and sign each others keys -- a system that is untenable in larger organizations. This document proposes a experimental format for the keylist file as well as requirements for clients who wish to implement this experimental keylist subscription functionality.</t>
