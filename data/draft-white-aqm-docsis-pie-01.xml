      <t>DOCSIS cable modems provide broadband Internet access to over one hundred million users worldwide. They are commonly positioned at the head of the bottleneck link for traffic in the upstream direction (from the customer), and as a result, the impact of buffering and bufferbloat in the cable modem can have a significant effect on user experience. The CableLabs DOCSIS 3.1 specification includes requirements for cable modems to support an Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithm that is intended to alleviate the impact that buffering has on latency sensitive traffic, while preserving bulk throughput performance. In addition, the CableLabs DOCSIS 3.0 specifications have also been amended to contain similar requirements.</t>
