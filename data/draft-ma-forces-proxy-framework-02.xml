      <t>The forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) working group is defining a protocol by which control elements (CEs) can communicate with forwarding elements (FEs) and control the behaviors of FEs. It is well known that ForCES based solutions have good scalability. Therefore, it makes sense to adopt ForCES to better integrate existing physical routers with ForCES routers. Plus, someone may want going forward to be able to use the developed hardware and software from existing routers as a part of ForCES based solutions. This draft presents a framework in which some possible migration solutions are discussed in details and some security implications are considered.</t>
