      <t>This document describes a distributed algorithm that can be applied to the problem of constraining IGP flooding in dense mesh topologies. The flooding topology utilizes two node-diverse spanning trees in order to provide complete coverage in the presence of any single failure while constraining the number of LSAs received by any IGP speaker connected to the flooding topology.</t>
