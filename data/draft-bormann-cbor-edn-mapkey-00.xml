    <abstract>
      <t>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR, STD 94 == RFC 8949) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. CBOR diagnostic notation (EDN) is widely used to represent CBOR data items in a way that is accessible to humans, for instance for examples in a specification. Complex examples often use nested maps, the map keys (labels) for each of which are often sourced from different specifications. While the e'' application extension provides a way to import data items, particularly constant values, from a CDDL model, it does not help with automatically selecting the right kind of map depending on its position in the nested maps. // The present document is intended to capture ideas initially // discussed at the CBOR WG interim 2025-06-25 and demonstrate some // design alternatives. It is not ready for adoption yet in any way.</t>
