      <t>This document provides a new mechanism for caching DNS resolvers. When all the authoritative name servers for a zone fail, and the request can't be found in the cache, during a period of time the caching DNS resolvers won't query the authoritative name servers, but directly return a SERVFAIL to the clients to reduce the recursive name server load and the network load.</t>
