      <t>This document provides a new mechanism for caching DNS resolvers.When all the authoritative name servers for a zone fail, and therequest can't be found in the cache, during a period of time thecaching DNS resolvers won't query the authoritative name servers, butdirectly return a SERVFAIL to the clients to reduce the recursivename server load and the network load.</t>
