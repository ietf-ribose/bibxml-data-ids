      <t>The widespread adoption of Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) led Mailing List Managers (MLM) to rewrite the From: header field as a workaround. This document proposes two methods to restore the original From: value of transformed messages, to be effected by the receiving Message Delivery Agent (rMDA). One method requires receivers to identify a set of trusted MLM operators who set the Author: header field. The other method tries to revert MLM transformations in order to verify DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) signatures that were applied by the author domain at submission time.</t>
