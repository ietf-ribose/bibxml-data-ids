      <t>The PWE3 architecture document places the interworking functionsolely in the PE, so that the attachment circuit between PE and CEcarries the native service. This is appropriate for a serviceprovider that offers the customer a seamless alternative fortransporting the native service. An alternative is to place theinterworking function in the CE, with ethernet access from CE to PE.We present advantages of this approach and note required changes tothe PWE architecture.</t>
