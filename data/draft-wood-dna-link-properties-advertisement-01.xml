      <t>Routers are increasingly connected to a variety of smart modems.Such a modem's incoming and outgoing link rates can be varied overtime with adaptive coding and modulation to suit the channelcharacteristics. The link rate and conditions offered by the modemto connected devices therefore vary. For connected devices tocondition traffic and get the most out of the modem's link capacity,they need to know the modem's link conditions. This documentdescribes one simple method for the modem to advertise link rate andother characteristics, via UDP messages, and discusses alternativeapproaches to communicating this information.</t>
