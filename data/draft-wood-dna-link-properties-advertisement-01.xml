      <t>Routers are increasingly connected to a variety of smart modems. Such a modem's incoming and outgoing link rates can be varied over time with adaptive coding and modulation to suit the channel characteristics. The link rate and conditions offered by the modem to connected devices therefore vary. For connected devices to condition traffic and get the most out of the modem's link capacity, they need to know the modem's link conditions. This document describes one simple method for the modem to advertise link rate and other characteristics, via UDP messages, and discusses alternative approaches to communicating this information.</t>
