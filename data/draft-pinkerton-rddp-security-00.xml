      <t>This document analyzes security issues around implementation and use of the Direct Data Placement Protocol(DDP) and Remote Direct Memory Access Protocol (RDMAP). It first defines an architectural model for an RDMA Network Interface Card (RNIC), which can implement DDP or RDMAP and DDP. The model includes a definition of resources that can be attacked. This document then introduces various Trust Models between a local peer and a remote peer and the tools that can be used to create countermeasures against attacks. Finally, the document reviews various attacks and the countermeasures to be used against them, grouping the attacks into spoofing, tampering, information disclosure, denial of service, and elevation of privilege.</t>
