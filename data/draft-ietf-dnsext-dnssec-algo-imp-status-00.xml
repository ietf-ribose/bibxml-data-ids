      <t>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) requires the use of cryptographic algorithm suites for generating digital signatures over DNS data. There is currently an IANA registry for these algorithms that is incomplete in that it lacks the recommended implementation status of each algorithm. This document provides an applicability statement on algorithm implementation compliance status for DNSSEC implementations. This document lists each algorithm's status based on the current reference. In the case that an algorithm is specified without an implementation status, this document assigns one.</t>
