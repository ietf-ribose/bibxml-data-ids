      <t>This document specifies a mechanism that can be implemented in layer-2 devices to mitigate attack vectors based on Neighbor Discovery messages. It is meant to complement other mechanisms implemented in layer-2 devices such as Router Advertisement Guard (RA-Guard) and DHCPv6-Shield, with the goal of achieving a comprehensive IPv6 First Hop Security solution. This document is motivated by the desire to achieve feature parity with IPv4 with respect to First Hop Security mechanisms.</t>
