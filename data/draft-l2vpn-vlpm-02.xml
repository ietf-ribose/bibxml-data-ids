      <t>In reference and response to draft-boldy-l2vpn-vplsloop-req-01, this document describes a solution in the form of a protocol function named VPLS External Loop Protection Mechanism (VLPM). VLPM is a protocol for a service provider to deploy at the PE to detect layer-2 loops in any external layer-2 segments (customer LAN) where customer deployed loop prevention methods may have failed. After detection of such a loop it facilitates configurable actions to protect the rest of the VPLS Domain from being affected without the need for inter-operation with customer network protocols, other VPLS PEs or sites.</t>
