      <t>GPS^IP is a suggested adjunct or alternate addressing scheme to IP, version 6. All of the remaining suggested, proposed, and ratified standards would remain as they are. As its name implies, GPS^IP would use Global Positioning System (GPS) information, perhaps in one of the currently unassigned regions of the IPv6 address space. This global position information would be placed somewhere in the 128 bit IP address, to provide a reasonable level of uniqueness. The remainder of the IP address could remain as currently described, both in IPv4 and IPv6, as described in other documents. Alternatively, a portion of the low order end of the IP address field could be populated with the MAC address as supplied by the interface.</t>
