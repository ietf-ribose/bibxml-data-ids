      <t>This document discusses and describes an architecture and protocol framework for the design and specification of a generic IP based architecture and protocol for Dormant Mode Host Alerting, aka IP paging. It focuses on the location and operation related interworking of the different functional entities as required to allow for a flexible and scalable deployment of the protocol. Furthermore, protocol transport and security mechanisms are evaluated and proposed to meet respective requirements on a DMHA protocol. This document intends to be a comprehensive guideline for the design of a generic IP paging architecture and protocol.</t>
