      <t>The concepts in this document are based on work onQ.Flowstatesig in the ITU SG11/Q5. Flow State Aware Signalinghas been worked on in the ITU for the past 13 years. However,this document stands on its own since no IETF compatible formathas yet been adopted. The goal of this protocol is to provide(1) a technique to have network nodes provide available rateflows (like TCP) rapid and periodic feedback to the sender as tothe maximum rate they should send and (2) to provide networkfeedback to fixed rate flows (like UDP voice) if the peak ratethey require can be statistically assured. Network traffic usingthis protocol should experience reduced response time, lessqueuing delay and less packet discards. The use of this protocolis limited to bounded subnets at the network edge and is to beconverted to and from standard IP flows at the subnetboundaries.</t>
