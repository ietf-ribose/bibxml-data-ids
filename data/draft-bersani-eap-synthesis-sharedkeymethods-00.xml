      <t>The purpose of this draft is to gives a broad picture of the existing proposed EAP methods, with a focus on shared key EAP methods. Indeed, it is the belief of the author that a standard replacement for EAP- MD5 (that is deprecated due to security reasons) is needed. By listing the existing shared key EAP methods, the goal is to gather consensus that such a multiplication of methods is detrimental and that a single methods retaining the best of the existing proposals could and should be drafted.</t>
