      <t>In virtualized networks, machines with processing and storage are virtualized resources on which network functional entities can be allocated and relocated dynamically. Such dynamic allocation and relocation of network entities imposes the challenge of service mobility, i.e., how to maintain not only coupling relations between those network entities but also sessions established between those entities in a virtualized environment. This document provides a reference model for managing service mobility in the virtual environment and defines the control protocol between the virtualized platform and the managing controller to realize service mobility. Such capability is especially longed for realizing more scalable and reliable telecom networks.</t>
