      <t>In IPv6, the current IPv4 site multihoming practises have been operationally disabled, to prevent a creation of an unmanageable swamp of more specific routes. Some argue that the lack of a comprehensive site multihoming solution is hindering the deployment of IPv6. This memo presents a few proposals for end-sites with autonomous system (AS) number to be able to derive a provider independent block of addresses from the first half of the 16-bit AS- number space. This could enable a temporary IPv6 site multihoming solution for those that already employ similar mechanisms in IPv4.</t>
