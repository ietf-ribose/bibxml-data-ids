      <t>In IPv6, the current IPv4 site multihoming practises have beenoperationally disabled, to prevent a creation of an unmanageableswamp of more specific routes. Some argue that the lack of acomprehensive site multihoming solution is hindering the deploymentof IPv6. This memo presents a few proposals for end-sites withautonomous system (AS) number to be able to derive a providerindependent block of addresses from the first half of the 16-bit AS-number space. This could enable a temporary IPv6 site multihomingsolution for those that already employ similar mechanisms in IPv4.</t>
