      <t>This document describes a Directory Server based VPN membership information distribution mechanism for layer-1 VPNs. The mechanism enables PEs to discover which other PEs have ports attached to CEs that are members of the same VPN, and allows PEs to discover attributes of currently configured CE-PE links and their associations with layer-1 VPNs. This document builds on the Layer One VPN Framework and provides an auto-discovery mechanism as discussed in the Layer One VPN Basic Mode document. This mechanism may be applied to the layer-1 VPN basic mode.</t>
