    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes the UDP-based Constrained GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (cGRASP), which is designed to be a constrained and lightweight version of the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol(GRASP, or the standard GRASP), with shortened messages and a built-in reliability mechanism. cGRASP can work reliably over UDP, making it suitable for IoT, where lightweight and resource- constrained devices dominate. Given the established ecosystem of CoAP and aiming to promote cGRASP adoption in IoT, this document also focuses on the cGRASP transition from UDP to a CoAP-based framework, i.e., CoAP-based cGRASP. Furthermore, this document also discusses the potential way to adapt the cGRASP to work on the network without IP connectivity.</t>
