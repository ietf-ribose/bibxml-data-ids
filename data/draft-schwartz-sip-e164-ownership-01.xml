      <t>When a call travels end-to-end relayed from the PSTN to SIP thenproblems occur with E.164 number ownership. Additionally, there aresecurity challenges when the PSTN-VoIP gateway has to authenticateand authorize the calling party. Without addressing these twoaspects the overall security story is weak or non-existent. Thisdocument aims to investigate these two aspect; it does, however, notinvestigate current E.164 number handling with RFC 4474 ("SIPIdentity"). Such an analysis is provided by other documents already.</t>
