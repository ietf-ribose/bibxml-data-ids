      <t>When a call travels end-to-end relayed from the PSTN to SIP then problems occur with E.164 number ownership. Additionally, there are security challenges when the PSTN-VoIP gateway has to authenticate and authorize the calling party. Without addressing these two aspects the overall security story is weak or non-existent. This document aims to investigate these two aspect; it does, however, not investigate current E.164 number handling with RFC 4474 ("SIP Identity"). Such an analysis is provided by other documents already.</t>
