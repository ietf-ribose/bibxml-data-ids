    <abstract>
      <t>The Internet Control Message Protocol for IPv6 (ICMPv6) is essential for network diagnostics but is vulnerable to off-path spoofing attacks, especially when error messages relate to stateless transport protocols like UDP. An attacker can forge these messages to degrade performance or enable Man-in-the-Middle attacks. This document explores solutions to this problem by first presenting a straightforward but flawed stateful challenge-response mechanism. It explains how this "strawman" approach, while preventing simple spoofing, introduces a severe vulnerability to state-exhaustion Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Building on this analysis, the document then proposes a robust, stateless challenge-response mechanism inspired by TCP SYN-Cookies. This proposal eliminates the need to store per-challenge state by computationally generating challenges. It limits state management to minimal flags on existing sockets or a bounded probabilistic data structure. This approach effectively authenticates ICMPv6 error messages while inherently resisting both off-path spoofing and state- exhaustion DoS attacks, thus improving the robustness of ICMPv6.</t>
