    <abstract>
      <t>Network services become increasingly multifarious. To efficiently guarantee the quality of services and fully utilize the network resources, network operators need to process the traffic flows through more fine-grained way. It is a promising way to deploy a series of middleboxes integrating various functions. However, this results in two challenges: 1) how to control such increasingly different middleboxes; 2) how can networks provide a common joint control scheme for both the middleboxes and forwarding elements. This document proposes a common joint scheme for middleboxes and forwarding elements. This scheme adopts logically centralized control method and utilizes standard control interfaces, which makes it flexible and efficient for the networks to determine the most optimizing path and the most appropriate functions in the middleboxes for traffic flows. It guarantees the quality of services and significantly improves resource utilization.</t>
