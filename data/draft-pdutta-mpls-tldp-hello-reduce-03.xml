      <t>Targeted LDP Hellos are used for establishing adjacencies with non- directly connected peers. After an LDP session is established to a targeted peer, the session Keepalives are sufficient to notify the intent of an LSR to maintain its adjacency with the peer. This document proposes a mechanism to turn off Targeted LDP Hellos after LDP session is established to a peer.</t>
