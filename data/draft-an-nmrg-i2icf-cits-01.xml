    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a structured framework for orchestrating, managing, and monitoring In-Network Computing Functions (ICFs) in Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS). For example, in the context of Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, efficient management of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications and their integration with C-ITS can greatly benefit from in-network computing. By leveraging ICFs, it becomes possible to optimize real- time communication, streamline traffic management, and enhance data processing and security services at the network edge. Moreover, by incorporating the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication paradigm, intelligent agents within vehicles, Roadside Units (RSUs), and network domains can directly collaborate to negotiate resources, exchange contextual information, and coordinate computing tasks, enabling adaptive and scalable orchestration across multi-domain C-ITS environments.</t>
