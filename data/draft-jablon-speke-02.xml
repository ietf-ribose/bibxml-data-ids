      <t>This document describes SPEKE, B-SPEKE, and SRP-4, three methods forpassword-based key agreement and authentication. In the same classof techniques as SRP-3 [RFC 2945], these methods provide a zero-knowledge proof of a password and authenticate session keys over anunprotected channel, with minimal dependency on infrastructure andproper user behavior. These methods are compatible with IEEE 1363and ANSI X9 standards, and are closely aligned with RFC 2945 from anapplication perspective. They use different techniques than earlierpatented alternatives, and provide an expanded set of choices forconvenient and secure personal authentication over the Internet.</t>
