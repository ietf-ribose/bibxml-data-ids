      <t>This document describes SPEKE, B-SPEKE, and SRP-4, three methods for password-based key agreement and authentication. In the same class of techniques as SRP-3 [RFC 2945], these methods provide a zero- knowledge proof of a password and authenticate session keys over an unprotected channel, with minimal dependency on infrastructure and proper user behavior. These methods are compatible with IEEE 1363 and ANSI X9 standards, and are closely aligned with RFC 2945 from an application perspective. They use different techniques than earlier patented alternatives, and provide an expanded set of choices for convenient and secure personal authentication over the Internet.</t>
