      <t>In 2006 the IETF published a suite of protocol documents comprising SPF and Sender ID, two proposed email authentication protocols. Because of possible interoperability issues, particularly but not only those created by simultaneous use of the two protocols by a receiver, the IESG was unable to determine technical consensus and decided it was best to publish all of RFC4405, RFC4406, RFC4407 and RFC4408 as Experimental documents. The IESG invited the community to observe their deployments for a period of time, and expressed hope for later convergence of opinion. After six years, sufficient experience and evidence have been collected that the experiments thus created can be considered concluded. This document presents those findings.</t>
