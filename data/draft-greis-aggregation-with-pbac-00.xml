    <abstract>
      <t>Aggregation has been proposed as one possible solution to the scalability problem of the Internet Integrated Services. The current suggestions for aggregation are based on measurement-based admission control, which allows for the omission of RSVP soft state in the interior routers of an aggregating domain. However, measurement-based admission control has certain flaws which may lead to over-reservations on links in the network under certain conditions. This can result in packet losses for reserved traffic. Hence, we believe that it will be necessary to discuss the possibility of using parameter-based admission control with aggregation. In this document, we present a technique for using parameter-based admission control with aggregation as a basis for further discussions, and we evaluate possible advantages and disadvantages.</t>
