      <t>SDN and NFV have been creating paradigm shifts across major service providers,governments, and industries. In most recent months, these two novel frameworks created jittersand excitements across major academic institutions and communities of practice. While theseare considered disruptive to major network infrastructures operating on status quo, SDN andNFV nonetheless bring network resiliency, scalability, manageability, and, mostimportantly, lower long-term operational expenditures.They create opportunities for innovation that engage key players from networks,security, and software to develop new software controllers, APIs, networks, and technologies.This document aims to propose a formal security architecture that overarches importantaspects of SDN and NFV 's frameworks.The architecture can be elaborated and modified as these two frameworks mature overtime.</t>
