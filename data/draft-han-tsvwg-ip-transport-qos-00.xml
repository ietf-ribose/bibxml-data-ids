    <abstract>
      <t>IP has been known as best-effort data transmission. However there are new applications requiring IP to provide deterministic services in terms of bandwidth and latency, such as network based AR/VR (Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality), industrial internet. This document proposes a solution in IPv6 that can be used by transport layer protocols to guarantee certain level of service quality. This new service is fined-grained and could apply to individual or aggregated TCP/UDP flow(s).</t>
