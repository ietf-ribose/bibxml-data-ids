      <t>This experimental specification proposes a Third-Party Authorization Label (TPA-Label) as a DNS-based method that allows Trusted Domains an efficient means to authorize acceptable Third-Party Domains. This method permits autonomous unilateral authorizations and uses scalable individual DNS transactions. A TPA-Label Resource Record transaction asserts an alignment exception to convey informally Federated Domains. It affords recipients a practical and safe means to extend Domain Alignment. Exceptions are managed by either the Trusted Domain, or their agent, seeking to avoid disruption of informal services enjoyed by their users. Third-Party Authorization of a Federated Domain eliminates a need to share private credentials.</t>
