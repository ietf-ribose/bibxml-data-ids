      <t>This memo outlines the nature of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an unincorporated association, reviews some history of the IETF Secretariat relevant to the current structure of the organization, and proposes steps that might be taken to move forward in the interest of the Internet community more generally. Since the IETF serves as a focal point in the technical evolution of the Internet infrastructure, it is important that any organizational changes take into account the wider public interest. Considerations of who provides support to the IETF hinge on the legal status of the IETF itself. Steps should be taken to clarify this matter as a first priority.</t>
