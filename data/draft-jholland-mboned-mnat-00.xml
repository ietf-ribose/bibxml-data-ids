      <t>This document defines a method for a network to maintain Network Address Translation address mappings for the transport of globally addressed multicast traffic within a network that can't otherwise forward the globally addressed traffic. A new Multicast Network Address Translation (MNAT) service is defined to communicate the address mappings to ingress and egress points within the network, and considerations for operation of the MNAT service are described.</t>
