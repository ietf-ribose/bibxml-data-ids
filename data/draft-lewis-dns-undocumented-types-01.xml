      <t>In the IANA registry of Resource Record (RR) TYPEs, as of October 1,2011, there are 10 type code values allocated with references thatare individual email boxes and not stable documents. Some of theregistrations represent works in progress and such a reference isviable. Some registrations are dormant or dead efforts. In allcases it would be helpful to have some reference to materialdescribing the type.</t>
