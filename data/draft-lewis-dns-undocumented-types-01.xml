      <t>In the IANA registry of Resource Record (RR) TYPEs, as of October 1, 2011, there are 10 type code values allocated with references that are individual email boxes and not stable documents. Some of the registrations represent works in progress and such a reference is viable. Some registrations are dormant or dead efforts. In all cases it would be helpful to have some reference to material describing the type.</t>
