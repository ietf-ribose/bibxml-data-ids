      <t>This document specifies an extension of Access Node Control Protocol to enforce security policy for network anti-attacking. An access router or NAS uses the proposed mechanism to send security policy to a layer 2 device which an attacking host may directly connects to. The solution proposed here can be used in either public access networks or enterprise networks.</t>
