      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), along with many other IPprotocols used for multimedia communications, are UDP-based, textualprotocols engineered for bandwidth rich links. As a result, thesemessages have not been optimized for message size. With the plannedusage of these protocols in wireless handsets as part of 2.5G and 3Gwireless, the large size of these messages is problematic, primarilyfor latency reasons. As a result, we propose a protocol shim betweenSIP (or any other UDP based protocol meeting our requirements) andUDP in order to efficiently compress SIP messages. Preliminaryresults have shown compression gains of up to 8:1.</t>
