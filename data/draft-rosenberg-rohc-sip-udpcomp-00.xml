      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), along with many other IP protocols used for multimedia communications, are UDP-based, textual protocols engineered for bandwidth rich links. As a result, these messages have not been optimized for message size. With the planned usage of these protocols in wireless handsets as part of 2.5G and 3G wireless, the large size of these messages is problematic, primarily for latency reasons. As a result, we propose a protocol shim between SIP (or any other UDP based protocol meeting our requirements) and UDP in order to efficiently compress SIP messages. Preliminary results have shown compression gains of up to 8:1.</t>
