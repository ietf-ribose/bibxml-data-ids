      <t>Despite the growing availability of good measurement platforms, it is still impossible to generalize IPPM metrics measurement among heterogeneous points of measure. To do so, the extra information inserted in the IP packets to perform the measurement has to be standardized. This document defines an IPPM measurement signature suitable for performing the measure of the current IPPM metrics, for integrating those used by manufacturers and for allowing the IPPM WG to define other measurement signature in the future.</t>
