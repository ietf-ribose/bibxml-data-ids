      <t>This document describes a scheme that allows a node to determine an IP address corresponding to a given link-layer id. The node performing the query doesn't need to be on the same link or subnet of the node associated with the link-layer id. This scheme was designed for the handoff candidate access router discovery in wireless networks, but may also be applied to other networks with similar behavior.</t>
