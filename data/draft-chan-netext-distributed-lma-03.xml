      <t>This draft proposes a distributed local mobility anchorsarchitecture. It splits the functions of a local mobility anchorinto different logical functions: (1) allocation of home networkprefixes or home addresses to mobile nodes, (2) location management(LM) which includes managing the IP addresses and locations of themobile nodes, and (3) mobility routing (MR) which includesintercepting and forwarding packets. The distributed local mobilityanchors architecture consists of home local mobility anchors (H-LMA)at the registered networks and visited local mobility anchors (V-LMA)at the visited networks. The V-LMA provides mobility routingfunction to avoid triangle routing problem in Proxy mobile IP,whereas the H-LMA keeps the location management function. The neededlocation information of a mobile node is acquired by a V-LMA from theH-LMA only when a packet is first sent to the mobile node via theV-LMA and are then cached at the V-LMA to enable optimized mobilityrouting for packets subsequently sent to the mobile node.When either the source or the destination node is a fixed node,bypassing the tunneling role of all LMA's will expose the locationinformation of the mobile node in some cases. Yet unnecessarily longroutes are still avoid by having multiple V-LMA's in differentnetworks and serving the packet transport with the nearest V-LMA.</t>
