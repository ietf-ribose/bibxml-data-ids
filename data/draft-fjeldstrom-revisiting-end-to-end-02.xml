      <t>This document examines the Internet's current connectivity model as an observed architectural equilibrium rather than as a failure to be corrected. It argues that the deployed Internet no longer provides ambient, unsolicited end-to-end transport reachability, not because of a single design error, but as the cumulative result of rational responses to scale, security exposure, administrative autonomy, and cost containment. Default-deny boundaries and policy enforcement have become structural features of the network. Under these conditions, applications and services that require mutual visibility rely on a recurring set of mechanisms, including relays, overlays, tunnels, rendezvous services, and long-lived outbound connections, to enable interaction. These mechanisms are widely deployed, often effective, and serve multiple legitimate roles, including constrained initiation, resource discovery, and intentional mediation or fan-out. Their persistence reflects sustained demand for controlled initiation in the absence of an explicit transport- layer admission capability. The document treats the convergence of these mechanisms into steady- state infrastructure as diagnostic evidence. When distinct interaction roles are collapsed into a common architectural form, local correctness is preserved, but predictable system-level effects emerge, including loss of locality, concentration of load, obscured failure semantics, and elevation of coordination and authorization semantics into higher layers. This analysis is diagnostic rather than prescriptive. It does not propose new protocols, standards, or deployment requirements, nor does it advocate restoring ambient reachability. Instead, it argues that if transport-visible end-to-end semantics (properties observable and enforceable without application payload inspection) are to remain meaningful under contemporary conditions, the architecture must provide some form of explicit, policy-bounded admission at boundaries. Any architectural responses discussed are illustrative only, intended to make these constraints concrete rather than to mandate specific mechanisms. The intent of this document is to make the present connectivity equilibrium visible as an architectural condition in its own right, and to provide a clearer foundation for subsequent analysis, design, or standardization efforts that engage with end-to-end semantics under real operational constraints.</t>
