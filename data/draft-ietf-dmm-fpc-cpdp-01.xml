    <abstract>
      <t>The specification as per this document supports the separation of the Control-Plane for mobility- and session management from the actual Data-Plane. The protocol semantics abstract from the actual details for the configuration of Data-Plane nodes and apply between a Client function, which is used by an application of the mobility Control- Plane, and an Agent function, which is associated with the configuration of Data-Plane nodes according to the policies issued by the mobility Control-Plane. The scope of the policies comprises forwarding rules and treatment of packets in terms of encapsulation, IP address re-writing and QoS. Additional protocol semantics are described to support the maintenance of the Data-Plane path.</t>
