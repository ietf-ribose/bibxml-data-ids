      <t>This document presents IPv6 addressing related to end-to-end connectivity in a Mobile Ad hoc Network with heterogeneous nodes. Internet connectivity for the mobile ad hoc network has to be provided by an Access Router. The nodes in such a network could only have IPv6 functionality, or contain support for Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) or facilitate ad hoc routing by using a MANET-based routing protocol. End-to-end connectivity means that the nodes must be able to communicate with each other locally and over the Internet. The draft focuses on the Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) as a MANET-based routing protocol.</t>
