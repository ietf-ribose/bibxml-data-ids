      <t>This draft presents a simulation analysis of Assured Service, an end-to-end service based on the differentiated services enhancements for IP. Assured Service has been the subject of much discussion in the past year in the IETF, but solid information on its applicability to the entire Internet has been lacking. This report is aimed at providing a first step in this direction. Assured Service requires an active queue management algorithm with preferential packet drop. The RIO algorithm (an extension of the RED algorithm) has been the primary method suggested and is the one evaluated here. Our results show that Assured Service does not provide clearly defined and consistent rate guarantees; the advantage gained by connections using Assured Service is not a quantifiable one. Further work would be required to determine an appropriate use of the Assured Service. A pdf version of this document is available and recommended for the figures it contains.</t>
