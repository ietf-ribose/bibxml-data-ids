      <t>This draft presents a simulation analysis of Assured Service, an end-to-endservice based on the differentiated services enhancements for IP. AssuredService has been the subject of much discussion in the past year in the IETF,but solid information on its applicability to the entire Internet has beenlacking. This report is aimed at providing a first step in this direction.Assured Service requires an active queue management algorithm with preferentialpacket drop. The RIO algorithm (an extension of the RED algorithm) has beenthe primary method suggested and is the one evaluated here. Our results showthat Assured Service does not provide clearly defined and consistent rateguarantees; the advantage gained by connections using Assured Service is nota quantifiable one. Further work would be required to determine an appropriateuse of the Assured Service. A pdf version of this document is available andrecommended for the figures it contains.</t>
