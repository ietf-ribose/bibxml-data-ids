      <t>During the period of IPv6 transition, both ISP and ICP (Internet Content Provider) care about user's experience in dual-stack network. They hesitate to provide IPv6 to their users due to the fear of poor IPv6 performance. Network-based Happy Eyeballs (NHE) is proposed in this memo as a approach to provide better connectivity to end users by doing accurate measurement and comparison on IPv6/IPv4 performance on the network side other than client-side Happy Eyeballs (HE) ([RFC8305]). It works independently with client's adoption of HE. REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION: The source of the document with test script is currently placed at GitHub [NHE-GitHub]. Comments and pull request are welcome.</t>
