      <t>This document describes a mechanism via which X Window System client applications may have their communications with the X Windows System server forwarded across a Telnet communications channel. This is desireable when the Telnet session is established through a Firewall or Network Address Translator which does not allow arbitrary connections to be created from the host machine to the client machine; or when the Telnet session is using an authenticated and encrypted channel and that same security is desired for the X Window System session data. Authorization to communicate across the tunnel is provided to the X Windows System client via use of X Display access control data.</t>
