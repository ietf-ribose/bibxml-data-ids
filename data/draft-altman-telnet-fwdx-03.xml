      <t>This document describes a mechanism via which X Window System client applications may have their communications with the X WindowsSystem server forwarded across a Telnet communications channel. Thisis desireable when the Telnet session is established through a Firewallor Network Address Translator which does not allow arbitrary connectionsto be created from the host machine to the client machine; or when theTelnet session is using an authenticated and encrypted channel and thatsame security is desired for the X Window System session data. Authorization to communicate across the tunnel is provided to the X Windows System client via use of X Display access control data.</t>
