    <abstract>
      <t>In a link state routing protocol like OSPF, the network and CPUbandwidth consumed by the routing protocol is primarily topropagate and process information about the network topologyand changes in the topology. The 'flooding procedure' of OSPFpropagates the topology change information to all routers in thenetwork. This procedure delivers the information, multiple timesto a router (depending on the source of the information and itsconnectivity) even though it needs to be delivered only once.The resultant wastage of network bandwidth and CPU processingtime reduces the scalability of OSPF. In some cases like a fullyconnected subgraph this redundant information increases by an orderof magnitude (from O(n) to O(n^2)). This draft describes atechnique to reduce this redundant information for a fullyconnected subgraph of the network.</t>
