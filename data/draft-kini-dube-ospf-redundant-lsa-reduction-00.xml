    <abstract>
      <t>In a link state routing protocol like OSPF, the network and CPU bandwidth consumed by the routing protocol is primarily to propagate and process information about the network topology and changes in the topology. The 'flooding procedure' of OSPF propagates the topology change information to all routers in the network. This procedure delivers the information, multiple times to a router (depending on the source of the information and its connectivity) even though it needs to be delivered only once. The resultant wastage of network bandwidth and CPU processing time reduces the scalability of OSPF. In some cases like a fully connected subgraph this redundant information increases by an order of magnitude (from O(n) to O(n^2)). This draft describes a technique to reduce this redundant information for a fully connected subgraph of the network.</t>
