      <t>This document presents an evaluation test suite for the initialevaluation of proposed TCP modifications. The goal of the test suiteis to allow researchers to quickly and easily evaluate their proposedTCP extensions in simulators and testbeds using a common set of well-defined, standard test cases, in order to compare and contrastproposals against standard TCP as well as other proposedmodifications. This test suite is not intended to result in anexhaustive evaluation of a proposed TCP modification or newcongestion control mechanism. Instead, the focus is on quickly andeasily generating an initial evaluation report that allows thenetworking community to understand and discuss the behavioral aspectsof a new proposal, in order to guide further experimentation thatwill be needed to fully investigate the specific aspects of a newproposal.</t>
