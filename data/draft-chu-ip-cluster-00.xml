      <t>This Internet-Draft is intended to provide a means for 'IP Clustering' across multiple servers. It is meant as an improved alternative to the various solutions for distributing WWW traffic already attempted by the IETF DNS Working Group. In addition, the clustering method can be applied not only to a heavily visited web server, but also to any overloaded TCP/IP servers such as a domain name server. The IP Cluster provides two primary functions: IP traffic distribution to multiple servers and fault-tolerance.</t>
