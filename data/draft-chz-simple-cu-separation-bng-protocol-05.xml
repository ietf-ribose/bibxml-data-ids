    <abstract>
      <t>A Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) in a fixed wireline access network is an Ethernet-centric IP edge router and the aggregation point for subscriber traffic. Control Plane (CP) and User Plane (UP) Separation (CUPS) for such a BNG improves flexibility and scalability but requires various communication between the UP and the CP. China Mobile, Huawei Technologies, and ZTE have developed a simple CUPS control channel Protocol (S-CUSP) to support such communication. This document is not an IETF standard and does not have IETF consensus. S-CUSP is presented here to make its specification conveniently available to the Internet community to enable diagnosis and interoperability.</t>
