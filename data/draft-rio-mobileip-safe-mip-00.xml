      <t>To date, a number of authentication protocols have been proposed forMobile-IP. Among these incompatible protocols, it is not clearuntil now which one will be the preferred one for global deploymentof Mobile-IP. Based on the policy of allowing various protocolsto co-exist, this draft specifies an authentication framework thatallows Mobile-IP entities to negotiate for a protocol to be employed.The framework also outlines the utilization of message extensionfor carrying all information required by the authentication protocolbeing used.Based on the proposed framework, this draft then proposes a 'MinimalPublic Key Based Authentication' which addresses the need forscalable but lightweight authentication protocol. The proposedprotocol secures the registration process, and requires a number ofmessage rounds that is fully compatible with the base Mobile-IP.</t>
