      <t>Several recent developments have significantly affected the carrier access networks. First, all large carrier backbones have migrated to MPLS. Second, carriers are upgrading access circuits with less expensive and high-speed Ethernet. Finally, the carriers will be offering advanced data services over the access network infrastructure. Subsequently, the carriers have to face challenges in migration cost, data transport efficiency and edge-to-edge user traffic management. The Dry-Martini architecture is designed to help the carriers to alleviate these challenges. It provides an approach to establish and maintain pseudo-wires over any access network infrastructure, while stripping off much of the IP/MPLS routing and signaling features that are irrelevant in access network. As a result, all the existing transport equipment, such as SONET/SDH MSPP, can provide MPLS pseudo- wire functionality without much change to the existing platform. Further, due its simplicity, this approach allows the new access devices, such as PON’s and Ethernet CPE’s, to maintain low cost, while being able to interface with MPLS networks. This document assumes that the reader has at least some familiarity with MPLS and pseudo-wire technologies.</t>
