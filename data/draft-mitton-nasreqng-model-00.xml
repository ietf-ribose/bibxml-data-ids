      <t>This document describes the terminology and an operational model of typical Network Access Server (NAS). The purpose of this effort is to set the reference space for describing and evaluating NAS service protocols, such as RADIUS (RFC 2138, 2139) and follow-on efforts like Diameter (draft-calhoun-diameter-04.txt). These are protocols for carrying authentication, authorization, and user configuration information between a Network Access Server which desires to authenticate its calls and a shared Authentication Server.</t>
