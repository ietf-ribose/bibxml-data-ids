      <t>SPAM, defined as sending unsolicited messages to someone in bulk,might be a problem on SIP open-wide deployed networks. Theresponsibility for filtering or blocking calls can belong todifferent elements in the call flow and may depend on variousfactors. This document defines an authorization based policylanguage that allows end users to upload anti-SPIT policies tointermediaries, such as SIP proxies. These policies mitigateunwanted SIP communications. It extends the Common Policyauthorization framework with additional conditions and actions. Thenew conditions match a particular Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)communication pattern based on a number of attributes. The range ofattributes includes information provided, for example, by SIP itself,by the SIP identity mechanism, by information carried within SAMLassertions.</t>
