    <abstract>
      <t>SATP Core defines an unidirectional transfer of assets in three stages, namely the Transfer Initiation stage (Stage-1), the Lock- Assertion stage (Stage-2) and the Commitment Establishment stage (Stage-3). This document defines the Setup Phase, often called "Stage-0", prior to the execution of SATP Core. During Setup, the two Gateways that would participate in the asset transfer are bound together via a "transfer context". The transfer context conveys information regarding the assets to be exchanged. Gateway can perform any kind of negotiation based on that transfer context, before entering into SATP Core.</t>
