    <abstract>
      <t>Currently, there are network management applications that present specific demands on a communication network. This document describes the APONF basic architecture, its elements and interfaces. The main APONF architecture entities are the Network Management Application Agent (NMAA), which is a network entity that creates and runs network services, and Application-based Policy Decision (ABPD), which supports classified application models. Each of these models support application demands that are similar in nature and therefore can be grouped/classified together. Moreover, the ABPD maps the classified application models into network capabilities, e.g., network management and controlling policies.</t>
