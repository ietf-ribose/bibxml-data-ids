      <t>Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960] specifiesSelective Acknowledgements (SACKs) to allow a transport layer datareceiver to acknowledge DATA chunks which arrive out-of-order. InSCTP, SACK information is advisory because the data receiver ispermitted to renege; that is, later discard a DATA chunk whichpreviously has been SACKed. Since delivery of a SACKed out-of-orderDATA chunk is not guaranteed, a copy of this DATA chunk MUST be keptin the data sender's retransmission queue until this DATA chunk iscumulatively acked.This document specifies Non-Renegable Selective Acknowledgements (NR-SACKs), an extension to SCTP's acknowledgment mechanism. NR-SACKsenable a data receiver to explicitly acknowledge out-of-order DATAchunks that have been delivered to the receiving application.(Recall that, in SCTP, out-of-order data sometimes can be delivered.)NR-SACKs also enable a data receiver to indicate any out-of-orderDATA chunks on which the receiver guarantees never to renege. Asopposed to SACKed DATA chunks, a sender can consider NR-SACKed DATAchunks as never requiring retransmission, thus freeing space in thedata sender's retransmission queue sooner.</t>
