      <t>Route tagging plays an important role in external BGP (RFC4271) relations for communicating various routing policies between peers. It is also a common best practice among operators to propagate various additional information about routes intra-domain. The most common tool used today to attach various information about routes is through the use of BGP communities (original, extended or large). This document defines a new flexible Community encoding in a BGP Attribute that enhances what can be accomplished with BGP communities. Two initial use cases are wide communities and flow specification version 2 (FSv2) actions upon a filter match.</t>
