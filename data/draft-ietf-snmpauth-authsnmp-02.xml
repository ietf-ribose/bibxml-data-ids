    <title>Authentication and Privacy in the SNMP</title>
    <date year="1990" month="July" day="5"/>
    <abstract>
      <t>The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) specification allows for the authentication of network management operations by a variety of authentication algorithms. This memo specifies alternatives to the trivial authentication algorithm. It also describes an abstract Authentication Service Interface (ASI) by which SNMP-based management applications or agents may--in a convenient and uniform way--benefit from the algorithms described here and a wide range of others. The terms of the ASI are used to describe three distinct algorithms, including one with support for privacy.</t>
