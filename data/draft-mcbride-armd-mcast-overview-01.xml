      <t>There has been much interest in issues surrounding massive amounts of hosts in the data center. There was a discussion, in ARMD, involving the issues with address resolution for non ARP/ND multicast traffic in data centers with massive number of hosts. This document provides a quick survey of multicast in the data center and should serve as an aid to further discussion of issues related to large amounts of multicast in the data center.</t>
