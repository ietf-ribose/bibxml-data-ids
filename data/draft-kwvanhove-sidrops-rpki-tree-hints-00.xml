      <t>In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), holders of IP address space can become a Certification Authority (CA), optionally hosting their repository. They can also delegate (part of) their resources to subordinate CAs, who in turn may do the same. This CA hierarchy forms a tree structure. Relying Party (RP) software walks this tree and determines the current valid objects. An underlying assumption is that this tree is finite and kept at a reasonable size. This assumption is not guaranteed to hold. This document proposes a new Tree Hint object on RPKI manifests that can add constraints for use in RP processing that ensure this assumption holds.</t>
