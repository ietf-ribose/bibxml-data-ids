      <t>Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are facing problems wherecongestion prevents full utilization of the path between sender andreceiver at today's "broadband" speeds. ISPs desire to control thecongestion, which often appears to be caused by a small number ofusers consuming a large amount of bandwidth. Building out morecapacity along all of the path to handle this congestion can beexpensive; and network operators have sought other ways to managecongestion. The current mechanisms all suffer from difficultymeasuring the congestion (as distinguished from the total traffic).The ConEx Working Group is designing a mechanism to make congestionalong any path visible at the Internet Layer. This documentdiscusses this mechanism.</t>
