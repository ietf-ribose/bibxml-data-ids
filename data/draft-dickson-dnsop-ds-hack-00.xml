      <t>This Internet Draft proposes a mechanism to encode relevant data for NS records (and optionally A and AAAA records) on the parental side of a zone cut, by encoding them in new DS algorithms. Since DS records are signed by the parent, this creates a method for validation of the otherwise unsigned delegation and glue records. This is beneficial if the name server _names_ are in a DNSSEC signed zone.</t>
