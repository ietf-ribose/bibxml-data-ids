      <t>Security and Smooth handoff with minimal data loss and delay aredesirable goals of any mobile network. To minimize data loss whilechanging FAs, a MN can request the previous FA to allocate buffersfor storing its (MN's) data. This buffered data is then forwardedto the MN when it registers with the new FA. This approach maydecrease the window of data loss and delay during handoff.Additionally, it may be necessary for the MN to authenticate thenew FA before allowing it (the new FA) to receive data from theprevious FA.This draft outlines a buffering protocol that minimizes thepotential loss of data while the MN changes its subnetwork point ofattachment. This draft also provides a way for the MN to verify thenew FA during the handoff, if and when that is needed.</t>
