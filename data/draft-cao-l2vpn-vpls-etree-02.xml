      <t>This document proposes an approach to support Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF) Ethernet Tree (E-Tree) in Virtual Private LAN Service [RFC4761] [RFC4762]. The proposed solution is characterized by breaking pseudowire setup between Leaf endpoints in E-Tree instance to fulfill the specific E-Tree requirement: Leaf cannot communicate with Leaf. Backward compatibility is also considered in this document.</t>
