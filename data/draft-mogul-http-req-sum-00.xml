      <t>RFC1122 [1] introduced a ``Requirements Summary'' format, to help implementors understand what aspects of a lengthy specification were mandatory, recommended, or optional. The HTTP/1.1 specification is similarly lengthy and complicated; many implementors have asked for guidance in understanding what they need to do. The latest draft revision of the HTTP/1.1 specification [2] has a placeholder section for a ``Requirements Summary'', but there has been relatively little discussion of the format and content of this summary in the HTTP working group. This document proposes a specific format for the summary, and gives an example summary for one section of the document.</t>
