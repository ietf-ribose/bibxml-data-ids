      <t>Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such aspieces of information or server processes, which are available inseveral equivalent replicas on different hosts. This includes, butis not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications. The goalof Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provideguidance to these applications, which have to select one or severalhosts from a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desiredresource. The protocol is under specification in the ALTO workinggroup. This memo discusses deployment related issues of ALTO forpeer-to-peer and CDNs, some preliminary security considerations, andalso initial guidance for application designers using ALTO.</t>
