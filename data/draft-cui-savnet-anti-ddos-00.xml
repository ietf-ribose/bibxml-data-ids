    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes the SAVA-based Anti-DDoS Architecture (SADA), which can efficiently detect, mitigate, and traceback Denial-of- Service (DDoS) attacks that spoof source addresses. The SADA consists of a distributed DDoS detection mechanism based on honeynets, a multi-stage DDoS mitigation mechanism, and a suspect- based DDoS traceback mechanism. By adopting the Source Address Validation Architecture (SAVA) of SAVNET and introducing the data plane and the control plane, the SADA makes minor changes to the SAVA while providing major benefits.</t>
