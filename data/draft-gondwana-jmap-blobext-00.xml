      <t>The JMAP base protocol (RFC8620) provides the ability to upload and download arbitrary binary data. This binary data is called a "blob", and can be used in all other JMAP extensions. The JMAP blob extension (RFC9404) added additional ways to create and access blobs by making inline method calls within a standard JMAP request. This extension adds more methods to work with blobs, including handling large blobs by processing them in chunks (building on RFC9404's blob construction support), and providing ways to efficiently describe small changes.</t>
