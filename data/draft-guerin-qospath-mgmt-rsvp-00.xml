    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a proposal aimed at allowing management through the RSVP [RZB+96] protocol of paths selected by a QoS routing algorithm such as those of [GOW96, ZSSC96]. The goals of the proposal are to allow efficient management of such QoS paths with the minimum possible impact to the RSVP protocol and the existing routing infrastructure. Basic features of the approach include leveraging of RSVP soft state mechanisms, and simple extensions to enable soft pinning (sticking) of paths selected by the QoS routing algorithm. In addition, the proposal addresses the issue of preventing the formation of data path loops, and of avoiding potential race conditions.</t>
