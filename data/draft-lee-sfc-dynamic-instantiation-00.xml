      <t>SFC instantiation may be static or dynamic. In a static instantiation, specific SF instances are predetermined by network operator's configuration or policy. However, since it does not consider the current state of network resources such as availability of the SF instances, the static instantiation may create more vulnerable SFPs to state changes of the network resources such as failure or overload. This document specifies SFC dynamic instantiation capability to create and update SFPs considering traffic optimization, failover of SFIs, and load balancing.</t>
