      <t>Intent and Intent-Based Networking are taking the industry by storm. At the same time, those terms are used loosely and often inconsistently, in many cases overlapping with other concepts such as "policy". This document is therefore intended to clarify the concept of "Intent" and how it relates to other concepts. The goal is to contribute towards a common and shared understanding of terms and concepts which can then be used as foundation to guide further definition of valid research and engineering problems and their solutions.</t>
