    <abstract>
      <t>The original content of this internet draft was to propose some extentions to OSPF encoding in the context of Wavelength Switched Optical Networks, especially for internal constraints of optical network elements. General description can be found in the framework document. This update of the document still aims at specifying the detailled structure of OSPF LSAs for WSONs. Nevertheless, the proposed LSA layout slightly differs from the current content of the information model and encodings drafts. As a result, the following sections highlight the differences between both approaches and summarize why the authors think these CCAMP's drafts would benefit from an update according to the proposed description.</t>
