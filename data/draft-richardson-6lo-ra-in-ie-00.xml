      <t>In TSCH mode of 802.15.4, as described by [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal], opportunities for broadcasts are limited to specific times and specific channels. An enhanced beacon must be broadcast periodically by every router to keep all nodes in sync. This document provides a mechanism by which other small ICMPv6 packets, such as Router Advertisements may be carried within the Enhanced Beacon, providing standard IPv6 router/host protocol.</t>
