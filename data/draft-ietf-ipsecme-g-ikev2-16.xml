    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents an extension to the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol for the purpose of a group key management. The protocol is in conformance with the Multicast Security (MSEC) key management architecture, which contains two components: member registration and group rekeying. Both components are required for a GCKS (Group Controller/Key Server) to provide authorized Group Members (GMs) with IPsec group security associations. The group members then exchange IP multicast or other group traffic as IPsec packets. This document obsoletes RFC 6407. This documents also updates RFC 7296 by renaming a transform type 5 from "Extended Sequence Numbers (ESN)" to the "Anti-Replay Protection (ARP)" and by renaming IKEv2 authentication method 0 from "Reserved" to "NONE".</t>
