      <t>This is a position paper for the pre-IETF83 Workshop on Smart Object Security. The author contends that layer-2 security solutions are not only in-adequate, but may in fact be harmful when deployed into smart object systems. While layer-2 security services may be valuable, they must be channel bound up to the layer-7 application layer.</t>
