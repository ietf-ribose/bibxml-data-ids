      <t>This document describes the methodology for benchmarking SessionInitiation Protocol (SIP) performance as described in Terminologydocument [5]. The methodology and terminology are to be used forbenchmarking signaling plane performance with varying signaling andmedia load. Both scale and establishment rate are measured bysignaling plane performance. The SIP Devices to be benchmarked maybe a single device under test (DUT) or a system under test (SUT).Benchmarks can be obtained and compared for different types ofdevices such as SIP Proxy Server, SBC, P-CSCF, and Server paired witha Firewall/NAT device.</t>
