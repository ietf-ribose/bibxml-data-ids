      <t>This document describes MIME types as per the rules defined in RFC 2048 [2] for application/SCCP and application/TCAP objects, for use in SIP applications. These MIME definitions will be typically used in deployments where interworking to the PSTN is required for call related and non-call related messages exchanged using services of SCCP and TCAP SS7 stack layers.</t>
