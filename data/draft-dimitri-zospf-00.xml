      <t>This memo documents our thinking to date regarding the use of version 3 of the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol as a mechanism for the autoconfiguration of IP routers within an OSPF area. Specifically, a method for the allocation and distribution of IPv4 and IPv6 subnet addresses without explicit configuration is described. Such a mechanism would be useful in an environment where routing is desirable, but the network administration skills necessary to configure IP routers are not available. This draft presents zOSPF (zeroconfigutaion OSPF), a protocol based on OSFPv3 that will allow routers to self configure and forward IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.</t>
