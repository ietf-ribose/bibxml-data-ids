      <t>When dealing with large amounts of keys the procedures to update a zone and to sign a zone need to be clearly defined and practically possible. The current idea is to have the zone KEY RR and the parent's SIG to reside in the child's zone and perhaps also in the parent's zone. Operational experiences have prompted us to develop an alternative scheme in which the parent zone stores the parent's signature over the child's key and also the child's key itself.</t>
