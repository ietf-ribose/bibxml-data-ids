      <t>This document records a format whereby a network operator can publish a mapping of IP address ranges to simplified geolocation information, colloquially termed a geolocation "feed". Interested parties can poll and parse these feeds to update or merge with other geolocation data sources and procedures. Some technical organizations operating networks that move from one conference location to the next have already experimentally published small geolocation feeds. At least one consumer (Google) has incorporated these ad hoc feeds into a geolocation data pipeline.</t>
