      <t>The Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) protocolestablishes core-base tree to forward multicast datagrams in anetwork. In PIM-SM, the core or Rendezvous Point (RP) of a group isdetermined at each multicast router by hashing a group address, i.e.,a class-D IP address, to one of the candidate RPs. The hash functionis characterized by its ability to evenly and uniquely choose thecore for a group and remains insensitive to the geographicdistribution of the group members and the sources. However, it mayresult in a multicast tree with high cost.This draft presents a relocation mechanism which is extension to PIM-SM, in which RP could be relocated periodically. When a new RP isfound, the original RP informs all members to re-join to the new RP.</t>
