      <t>One of the best chances for a Service Provider to face the complexgrowth of IP Services, and their challenging requirements/SLAs alongthe Core network, is to enrich the current Performance metrics - mainlyderived from a "Network-Oriented point of view", and therefore ageneral perspective, not focused on specific services - with some morePerformance factors, so to include a "Service-Oriented point of view",more centred on the particular kind of service, with its owncharacteristics in terms of protocol, application, manageability, andso on.Almost nothing about this new approach has been standardized yet forthe core network.To achieve the above goal, and starting from the one-to-groupperformance metrics outlined in RFC 5644 [RFC5644], a new metricscomposition/aggregation framework is proposed in this memo, where themain focus is on multiparty communications (e.g. video providers,online biding, online stock market, etc.).Finally this memo is tuned to RFC 6390 [RFC6390] in terms of scopes,framework concepts, and need to widen the current performance metricsdepending on the application, service etc.</t>
