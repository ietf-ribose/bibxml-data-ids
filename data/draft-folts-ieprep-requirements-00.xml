    <abstract>
      <t>Priority telecommunication capabilities are required to support critical emergency communications through the public telecommunications infrastructure to support disaster recovery operations for saving lives and restoring community infrastructure. Many important issues are identified that are essential to ensuring effective emergency telecommunications capabilities are established in Internet-based infrastructures. The term 'communication session' is used instead of 'call' so that all modes of communication can be considered collectively; emergency telecommunication capabilities are not just limited to telephony traffic. No solutions are suggested, but the basic requirements are clearly identified for consideration by the ieprep Working Group of the IETF.</t>
