      <t>The purpose of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) is to deliver content to end users in an efficient manner from the perspective of the network providers and with consistently good performance from the perspective of the end user. Due to footprint limitations of a single network provider, it may be necessary to interconnect CDNs between different providers. The Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) working group has been chartered to develop an interoperable and scalable solution for such CDN interconnection. The requirements for CDN interconnection are being discussed and developed in various industry forums. One example is the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) Cloud Services Forum (CSF) which is looking at CDN interconnection requirements from the perspective of telecom providers. This document introduces some additional requirements to be included in the CDNI working group based on conclusions reached by ATIS CSF. The goal is for specifications developed by CDNI to successfully support some of the needs expressed by ATIS CSF as interpreted by the authors of this document.</t>
