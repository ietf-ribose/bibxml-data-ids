    <abstract>
      <t>This document discusses the motivation and requirements for including specific operational and telemetry information into data packets while the data packet traverses a path between two points in the network. This method is referred to as "in-band" Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM), given that the OAM information is carried with the data packets as opposed to in "out-of-band" packets dedicated to OAM. In-band OAM complements other OAM mechanisms which use dedicated probe packets to convey OAM information.</t>
