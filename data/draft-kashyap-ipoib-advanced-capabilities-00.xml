      <t>InfiniBand Architecture(IBA) defines a high speed, channel based interconnect between systems and devices. The InfiniBand architecture provides multiple modes of transport services with differing characteristics. IPoIB may be implemented over any or multiple such modes to take advantage of the underlying mode's features. IPoIB by default is implemented over the UD mode of IBA. This document describes IPoIB over IBA's non-UD transport modes.</t>
