      <t>OSPFv3 includes a mechanism for supporting multiple instances on thesame link. OSPFv2 could benefit from such a mechanism in order tosupport multiple routing domains on the same subnet. The OSPFv2instance ID is reserved for support of separate OSPFv2 protocolinstances. This is different from OSPFv3 where it could be used forother purposes such as putting the same link in multiple areas.OSPFv2 supports this capability using a separate subnet or the OSPFmulti-area adjacency capability.</t>
