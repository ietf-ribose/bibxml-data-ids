      <t>Mobile DTLS (Mobi-D) is an extension to DTLS that provides hostmobility support. After obtaining a new IP address or port, a DTLSclient mobile host can continue sending to its DTLS servercorrespondent host. The mobile host continues to use the existingset of security parameters, from the new address, without re-negotiation. The correspondent host accepts packets from the new IPaddress or port, also without re-negotiation. After receiving anyvalid DTLS packet from the mobile host's new address or port, thecorrespondent host uses the new address or port to send to the mobilehost.</t>
