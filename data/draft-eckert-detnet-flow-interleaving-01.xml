      <t>This memo explain requirements, benefits and feasibility of a new DetNet service function tentatively called "flow interleaving". It proposes to introduce this service function into the DetNet architecture. Flow interleaving can be understood as a DetNet equivalent of the IEEE TSN timed gates. Its primary role is intended to be at the ingress edge of DetNet domains supporting higher utilization and lower bounded latency for flow aggregation (interleaving of flows into a single flow), as well as higher utilization and lower bounded latency for interleaving occurring in transit hops of the DetNet domain in conjunction with in-time per-hop bounded latency forwarding mechanisms.</t>
