      <t>This Internet draft enhances cellular-IP mobility protocol with aContext Transfer mechanism aiming to further optimise the handoff operation in mobile networks. Within a cellular-IP domain, during thehandoff from one cellular-IP base station to another, cellular-IPpackets could be used to initiate and transfer authorised contextfrom the previous cellular-IP base station via the cellular-IPgateway to the new cellular-IP base station. This draft presents how the context transfer extension introduced could facilitate inreducing latency and packet loss by avoiding the signalling required between the mobile node and the new base station in re-establishingthe desired state information.</t>
