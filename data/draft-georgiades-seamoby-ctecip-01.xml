      <t>This Internet draft enhances cellular-IP mobility protocol with a Context Transfer mechanism aiming to further optimise the handoff operation in mobile networks. Within a cellular-IP domain, during the handoff from one cellular-IP base station to another, cellular-IP packets could be used to initiate and transfer authorised context from the previous cellular-IP base station via the cellular-IP gateway to the new cellular-IP base station. This draft presents how the context transfer extension introduced could facilitate in reducing latency and packet loss by avoiding the signalling required between the mobile node and the new base station in re-establishing the desired state information.</t>
