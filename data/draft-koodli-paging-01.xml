      <t>This document defines an IP paging concept that supports IP dormancyfor hosts and Mobile Nodes. The concept specifies a generic modelthat can be applied to several mobility mechanisms (including MobileIPv6, Localized Mobility Managament) and is independent of thelayer-2 access technology and paging capabilities. The model allowsfor optimizations of the benefits of layer-2 paging when present,while minimizing the impact on layer-2 paging.</t>
