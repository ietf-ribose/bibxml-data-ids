      <t>This document defines an IP paging concept that supports IP dormancy for hosts and Mobile Nodes. The concept specifies a generic model that can be applied to several mobility mechanisms (including Mobile IPv6, Localized Mobility Managament) and is independent of the layer-2 access technology and paging capabilities. The model allows for optimizations of the benefits of layer-2 paging when present, while minimizing the impact on layer-2 paging.</t>
