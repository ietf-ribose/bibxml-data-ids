    <abstract>
      <t>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol Attestable version 2 (HTTPA/2) is an HTTP extension. It is a transaction-based protocol agnostic to Transport Layer Security (TLS) in which the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is considered a new type of requested resource over the Internet. The original Hypertext Transfer Protocol Attestable (HTTPA) (referred to as HTTPA/1 in the rest of the document) includes remote attestation (RA) process onto the HTTPS protocol in the assumption of using Transport Layer Security (TLS) across the Internet. In contrast, the design of HTTPA/2 could establish a trusted (attested) and more secure communication without dependence on TLS. The definition of Attestation for the purposes of this draft: The process of vouching for the accuracy of TEE based services, configuration, and data where the TEE conveys Evidence about its environment, roots of trust and protected functions. The Evidence is a digital expression of TEE trustworthiness.</t>
