      <t>The Kerberos protocol [RFC1510] currently establishes session keys by the assertion of one party (usually the KDC). This document describes a method for using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm to establish the shared secret between a Kerberos client and application service. For the purposes of this document, the Ticket Granting Service is considered an application service.</t>
