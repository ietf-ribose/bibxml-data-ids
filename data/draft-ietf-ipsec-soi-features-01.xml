      <t>This document describes many features of the proposals for the successor to IKEv1. The purpose of the document is to help the IPsec Working Group decide which features they want for the next protocol. The document focuses on how those features are instantiated in two proposals, IKEv2 and JFK, but other ideas for features and options are also included. Most of the material in this document comes from many of the authors of the JFK and IKEv2 proposals. This document is meant to help the Working Group choose which features it finds important for the successor to IKE. It should be short-lived and is not expected to become an RFC.
