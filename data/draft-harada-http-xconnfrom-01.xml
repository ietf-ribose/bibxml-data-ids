    <abstract>
      <t>HTTP/1.1 defines a Connection header, allowing 'the sender to specify options that are desired for that particular connection and MUST NOT be communicated by proxies over further connections.' Because HTTP/1.0 proxies would normally forward the Connection header without obeying its specification, a Connection header received in an HTTP/1.0 message must normally be treated as if it had been forwarded in error. This document defines an X-Connfrom header that identifies the sending host, and so is safe to use in HTTP/1.0 messages. This might be useful in experimenting with HTTP/1.0 implementations of applications of the HTTP/1.1 Connection mechanism.</t>
