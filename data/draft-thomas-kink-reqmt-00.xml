      <t>The KINK working group is chartered to create a standards track protocol to facilitate centralized key management for IPsec security associations as defined in RFC 2401, as an alternative to IKE (RFC 2409). Participating systems will use the Kerberos architecture as defined in RFC 1510 (and its successors) for key management. The goal of the working group is to produce a streamlined, fast, easily managed, and cryptographically sound protocol without requiring public key. The working group will not require changes to either IPsec (RFC 2401), or Kerberos (RFC 1510).</t>
