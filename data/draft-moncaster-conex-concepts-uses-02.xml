      <t>Internet Service Providers (operators) are facing problems wherelocalized congestion prevents full utilization of the path betweensender and receiver at today's "broadband" speeds. Operators desireto control this congestion, which often appears to be caused by asmall number of users consuming a large amount of bandwidth.Building out more capacity along all of the path to handle thiscongestion can be expensive and may not result in improvements forall users so network operators have sought other ways to managecongestion. The current mechanisms all suffer from difficultymeasuring the congestion (as distinguished from the total traffic).The ConEx Working Group is designing a mechanism to make congestionalong any path visible at the Internet Layer. This documentdescribes example cases where this mechanism would be useful.</t>
