      <t>This document describes an IMAP extension that allows a client to convert and retrieve message MIME parts on demand. The conversion would be from one Content-Type to another. The client can discover the conversion set the server supports. It is assumed that there are two distinct phases: one, server conversion capability discovery, and two, client retrieval of a converted MIME part. In addition to MIME type conversion this document allows for compressed body part retrieval as a special case of conversion.</t>
