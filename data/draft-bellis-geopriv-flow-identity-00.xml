      <t>Identity Extensions using an IP address and port number to request a location based on an individual packet flow have been previously specified by the GEOPRIV Working Group. However certain kinds on NAT require that identifiers for both ends of the packet flow must be specified in order to unambiguously satisfy the location request. This document specifieds a Flow Identity Extension for the HTTP- Enabled Location Delivery (HELD) Protocol to support this requirement.</t>
