      <t>HTTP, the hypertext transfer protocol, underpins the World-Wide Web (WWW). As the Web has grown, pressures have mounted to add a variety of facilities to HTTP. Some of the new features that have been proposed include: keep-alive, packetized data, compression, security, and payment. This memo offers an alternative: well-defined hooks in a slightly modified HTTP framework that make it possible to add extensions to the basic protocol in a way that will retain compatible behavior between clients and servers, yet allow both clients and servers to discover and use extended capabilities. The goal is to use HTTP as just a transport mechanism, leaving other, higher-level (session) activities to extensions.</t>
