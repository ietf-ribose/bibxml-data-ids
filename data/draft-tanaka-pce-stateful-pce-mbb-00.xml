    <abstract>
      <t>Stateful PCE (Path Computation Element) and its corresponding protocol extensions provide a mechanism that enables PCE to do stateful control of MPLS Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSP). Stateful PCE supports manipulating the existing LSP's state and attributes (e.g., bandwidth and route) and also creating totally new LSPs in the network. In the current MPLS TE network using RSVP-TE, LSPs are often controlled by "make-before-break (M-B-B)" signaling by headend for the purpose of LSP restoration and reoptimization. In most cases, it is an essential operation to reroute LSP traffic without any data disruption. This document specifies the procedure of applying Stateful PCE's control to make-before-break RSVP-TE signaling. In this document, two types of restoration/reoptimization procedures are defined, one- stroke mode and granular mode. This document also specifies the usage and handling of stateful PCEP (PCE Communication Protocol) messages, expected behavior of PCC as RSVP-TE headend and several extensions of additional objects.</t>
