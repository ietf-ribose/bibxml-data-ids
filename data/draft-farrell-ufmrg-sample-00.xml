      <t>This draft provides reasoning as to why the Usable Formal Methods research group might benefit from having an IETF-relevant sample problem and describes one such (IMAP search). This is just an initial draft aiming to help move discussion forward so may be dropped or replaced by other drafts or the research group may prefer some non I-D format, or the research group may decide that sample problems aren't sufficiently useful. Early days, basically!</t>
