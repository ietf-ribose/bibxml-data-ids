      <t>A number of systems which understand X.509 client certificates havedeveloped various ad hoc mechanisms to map a certificate to a'userid'/'group(s)' value which can then be used for access control.The mechanisms include idiosyncratic name forms for the SubjectNamefield such as encoding the userid as a CommonName and the group as anOrganizationalUnit, or mapping the certificate against an entry in adirectory system. This document describes an otherName extension ofthe GeneralName type which can be used in the SubjectAltNameextension or IssuerAltName extension to directly encode userid andgroup information.</t>
