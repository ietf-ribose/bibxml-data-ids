      <t>A number of systems which understand X.509 client certificates have developed various ad hoc mechanisms to map a certificate to a 'userid'/'group(s)' value which can then be used for access control. The mechanisms include idiosyncratic name forms for the SubjectName field such as encoding the userid as a CommonName and the group as an OrganizationalUnit, or mapping the certificate against an entry in a directory system. This document describes an otherName extension of the GeneralName type which can be used in the SubjectAltName extension or IssuerAltName extension to directly encode userid and group information.</t>
