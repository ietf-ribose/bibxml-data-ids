    <abstract>
      <t>The document enumerated methods of port assignment in CGN contexts, more focused on NAT64 environments. The analysis categorized the different methods with several key features. The uses of existing protocols are described corresponding to those features. The document also shared the port-usage experiences, relevant findings, evaluations and workarounds. It's expected the document could provide a informative base line to help operators choosing a proper method.</t>
