      <t>The use of neighbor graphs as a method for dynamically caching thecontext of mobile stations in front of the station's mobility path canreduce the latency of handoff's between base stations or access points.Neighbor graphs capture the set of all potential mobility paths for awireless network. Given any base station or access point, the set of allpossible hand-offs can easily be determined by examining the neighborgraph in either a distributed fashion (at each base station) orcentralized at the AAA server. This draft describes how the neighborgraph algorithm works at both the base station and the AAA server.</t>
