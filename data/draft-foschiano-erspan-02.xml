      <t>This document describes an IP-based packet capture format that can be used to transport exact copies of packets to a network probe to analyze and characterize the operational load and protocol distribution of a network as well as to detect anomalies such as network-based worms or viruses. This replication and transport mechanism operates over one or multiple switch or router ports whose traffic can be mirrored and forwarded to a destination device in charge of traffic analysis and reporting.</t>
