      <t>This document describes a series of extensions for OSPF[1] and MOSPF[2]that can be used to provide Quality of Service (QoS) routing inconjunction with a resource reservation protocol such as RSVP[4] orother mechanisms that can notify routing of the QoS needs of a dataflow. Advertisements indicating the resources available and theresources used are advertised to the OSPF routing domain and paths arecomputed based on topology information, link resource information, andthe resource requirements of a particular data flow.</t>
