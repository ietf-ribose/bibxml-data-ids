      <t>This document describes a series of extensions for OSPF[1] and MOSPF[2] that can be used to provide Quality of Service (QoS) routing in conjunction with a resource reservation protocol such as RSVP[4] or other mechanisms that can notify routing of the QoS needs of a data flow. Advertisements indicating the resources available and the resources used are advertised to the OSPF routing domain and paths are computed based on topology information, link resource information, and the resource requirements of a particular data flow.</t>
