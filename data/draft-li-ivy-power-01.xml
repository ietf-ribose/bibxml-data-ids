    <abstract>
      <t>Network sustainability is a key issue facing the industry. Networks consume significant amounts of power at a time when the cost of power is rising and sensitivity about sustainability is very high. As an industry, we need to find ways to optimize the power efficiency of our networks both at a micro and macro level. We have observed that traffic levels fluctuate and when traffic ebbs there is much more capacity than is needed. Powering off portions of network elements could save a significant amount of power, but to scale and be practical, this must be automated. The natural mechanism for enabling automation would be a Yet Another Next Generation (YANG) interface, so this document proposes a YANG model for power management.</t>
