      <t>This document proposes extensions to the Mobile IPv4 base protocol[RFC2002] enabling mobile nodes and mobility agents to dynamicallysetup security associations. Mobile IP is therefore employed as asupporting protocol for SA negotiation. The proposed mechanism isbased on RSA cryptography [RSA78], entities acting as keydistribution centers and Diffie-Hellman exchanges [DH76].</t>
