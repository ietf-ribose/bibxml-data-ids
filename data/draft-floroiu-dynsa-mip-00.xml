      <t>This document proposes extensions to the Mobile IPv4 base protocol [RFC2002] enabling mobile nodes and mobility agents to dynamically setup security associations. Mobile IP is therefore employed as a supporting protocol for SA negotiation. The proposed mechanism is based on RSA cryptography [RSA78], entities acting as key distribution centers and Diffie-Hellman exchanges [DH76].</t>
