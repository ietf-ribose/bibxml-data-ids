      <t>Wireless, low power field devices enable industrial users tosignificantly increase the amount of information collected and thenumber of control points that can be remotely managed. Thedeployment of these wireless devices will significantly improve theproductivity and safety of the plants while increasing the efficiencyof the plant workers. For wireless devices to have a significantadvantage over wired devices in an industrial environment thewireless network needs to have three qualities: low power, highreliability, and easy installation and maintenance. The aim of thisdocument is to analyze the requirements for the routing protocol usedfor low power and lossy networks (L2N) in industrial environments.</t>
