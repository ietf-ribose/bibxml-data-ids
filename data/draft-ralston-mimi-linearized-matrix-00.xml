    <abstract>
      <t>Matrix is an existing openly specified decentralized secure communications protocol able to provide a framework for instant messaging interoperability. Matrix rooms (aka conversations) currently use a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for persisting events/ messages. Servers broadcast their changes to the DAG to every other server in order to create new events. This model provides excellent decentralization characteristics and conversation history replication, but proves complex when aiming to use Matrix strictly for interoperability between today's existing messaging service providers, which often do not persist chat history serverside, and do not seek to replicate it between servers. This document explores an API surface for Matrix which optimizes for ease of interoperability at the expense of decentralized conversation history at a per-room level. We call this API surface "Linearized Matrix".</t>
