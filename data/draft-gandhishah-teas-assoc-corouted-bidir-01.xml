    <abstract>
      <t>In packet transport networks, there are requirements where reverse unidirectional LSP of a bidirectional LSP needs to follow the same path as its forward unidirectional LSP. This document describes how the RSVP association signaling is used to bind two co-routed point-to-point unidirectional LSPs into an associated co-routed bidirectional LSP in single-sided provisioning case. Fast-reroute procedures are defined to ensure that the traffic flows on the co-routed path after a failure event.</t>
