      <t>This document provides an applicability statement on the use of Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols and mechanisms to satisfy the requirements of the Layer 1 Virtual Private Network (L1VPN) Enhanced Mode. L1VPNs provide customer services and connectivity at layer 1 over layer 1 networks. The operation of L1VPNs is divided into the Basic Mode and the Enhanced Mode, where the Enhanced Mode of operation may also include exchange of routing information between the layer 1 network and the customer domain.</t>
