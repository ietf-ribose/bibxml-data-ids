      <t>There is a growing number of people, on the Internet and elsewhere,that are interested in knowing when others are available, in order tocommunicate with them. A system that provides this information isknown as Presence Service.Instant Messaging is the ability to communicate with someone in arapid, conversational fashion. This usually involves short textmessages, but it may be extended in different ways.This draft is a response to the efforts of the Instant Messaging andPresence Protocol (IMPP) group. It describes an architecture andprotocols for Presence and Instant Messaging that meet therequirements of [RFC 2779].
