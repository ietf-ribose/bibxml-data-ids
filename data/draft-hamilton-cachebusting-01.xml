      <t>Cachebusting is the sometimes deliberate, sometimes inadvertant, practice of defeating caching. This document explains the nature of the problem with relation to proxy cache servers using the World-Wide Web's HTTP protocol, and outlines some simple measures which may be taken to make an HTTP based service more 'cache friendly'. Since Web caching is still a novel concept, we also explain the basic principles behind it. This document should be read by developers of HTTP based products and services - we assume that the reader is already familiar with HTTP.</t>
