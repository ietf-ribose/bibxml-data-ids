    <abstract>
      <t>This document discusses privacy properties of the SCONEPRO metadata or network-to-host signals. This covers questions that were raised during the IETF 119 BoF and subsequent discussions. It is not intended to be published as a separate RFC but might be incorporated as a part of the security considerations or other content within eventual SCONEPRO RFCs together with other documents covering security considerations. Other documents will address additional aspects of the security considerations such as authentication, integrity protection, and encryption of SCONEPRO metadata.</t>
