      <t>This draft describes an extension to Integrated IS-IS, which can be used to pass additional information among routers within an IS-IS domain that can aid in policy administration. This extension is roughly similar in operation to the BGP communities attribute; in that it provides a mechanism to associate a routed prefix with some administrative group, such that an administrator may define a routing policy for that group.</t>
