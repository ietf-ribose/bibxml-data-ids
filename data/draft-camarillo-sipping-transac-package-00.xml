      <t>SIP provides a SIP Events notification framework that is extensible throught the addition of event packages. This document defines a transaction event package for the SIP Events notification, along with a data format used in notifications for this package. The transaction package allows users to subscribe to a resource in an application server and receive notifications about the changes in state of transactions the application server initiates as part of a service. Additionally, we define a new SIP Associated-Transactions-State header field that allows a server to return a subscrible URI that provides transactions notification information.</t>
