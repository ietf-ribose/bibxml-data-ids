      <t>The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) was designed to allowsimple and efficient protection of RTP. To provide this, encryptionand authentication of media and control signaling are tightly coupledto the RTP session, and the information in the RTP header. Hence, ingeneral, it is not possible to perform store-and-forward of protectedmedia using SRTP.This document gives, based on a use case analysis, requirements thatSRTP and new SRTP transforms need to satisfy in order to allow securestore-and-forward operation. A first outline on how to introduce theneeded new functionality and transforms in SRTP is also presented.</t>
