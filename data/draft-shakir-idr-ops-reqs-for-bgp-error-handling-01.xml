      <t>BGP-4 is utilised as a key intra- and inter-Autonomous System routingprotocol in modern IP networks. The failure modes as defined by theoriginal protocol standards are based on a number of assumptionsaround the impact of session failure. Numerous incidents both in theglobal Internet routing table and within Service Provider networkshave been caused by strict handling of a single invalid UPDATEmessage causing large-scale failures in one or more AutonomousSystems.This memo describes the current use of BGP-4 within Service Providernetworks, and outlines a set of requirements for further work toenhance the mechanisms available to a BGP-4 implementation whenerroneous data is detected. Whilst this document does not providespecification of any standard, it is intended as an overview of a setof enhancements to BGP-4 to improve the protocol's robustness to suitits current deployment.</t>
