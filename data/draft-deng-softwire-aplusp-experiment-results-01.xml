      <t>This memo focuses on the IPv6 flavor of A+P. This memo describes an implementation of A+P in a provider's IPv6- only network. It provides details of the implementation, network elements, configurations and test results as well. Besides traditional port range A+P, a scattered port sets flavor of A+P is also implemented to verify feasibility of offering non-continuous port sets with A+P approach, and to investigate possibility and efforts of making UPnP 1.0 work with A+P. The test results consist of the application compatibility test, UPnP 1.0 extensions and UPnP 1.0 friendly port allocation for A+P, port usage and BitTorrent behaviors with A+P. This memo focuses on the IPv6 flavor of A+P.</t>
