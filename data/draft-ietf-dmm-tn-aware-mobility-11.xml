    <abstract>
      <t>Network slicing in 5G supports logical networks for communication services of multiple 5G customers to be multiplexed over the same infrastructure. While 5G slicing covers logical separation of various aspects of 5G services, user's data plane packets over the radio access network (RAN) and mobile core network (5GC) use IP transport in many segments of the end-to-end 5G slice. When end-to- end slices in a 5G system use IP network resources, they are mapped to corresponding IP transport network slice(s) which in turn provide the bandwidth, latency, isolation and other criteria requested by the 5G slice. This document describes mapping of 5G slices to IP or Layer 2 transport network slices when the IP transport network (slice provider) is separated by an "attachment circuit" from the networks in which the 5G network functions are deployed, for example, 5G functions that are distributed across data centers. The slice mapping proposed here is supported transparently when a 5G user device moves across 5G attachment points and session anchors.</t>
