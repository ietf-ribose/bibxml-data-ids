    <abstract>
      <t>In-Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintanence (IOAM), defined in RFC 9197, is an on-path telemetry method to collect and transport the operational state and telemetry information that can be used in calculating various performance metrics. IOAM Direct Export (IOAM- DEX) is one of IOAM Trace-Option types, in which generated telemetry information is exported according to a local policy. MPLS Network Actions (MNA) techniques are meant to indicate actions to be performed on any combination of Label Switched Paths (LSPs), MPLS packets, and the node itself, and also to transfer data needed for these actions. This document explores how MNA can be used for collecting on-path operational state and telemetry information using IOAM-DEX Trace-Option.</t>
