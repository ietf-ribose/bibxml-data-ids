      <t>Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) improves the reliability and availability in DetNet networks composed of any combination of wired and wireless segments. The RAW Architecture leverages and extends RFC 8655, the Deterministic Networking Architecture, to adapt to challenges that affect prominently the wireless medium, in particular intermittent transmission loss. This document defines a network control loop that optimizes the use of constrained bandwidth and energy while assuring the expected connectivity services. The loop involves a new Point of Local Repair function in the DetNet service sublayer that dynamically selects the DetNet path(s) for the future packets to route around local connectivity degradation.</t>
