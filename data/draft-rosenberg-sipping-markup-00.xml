      <t>In order for SIP applications to work, they will frequently need tocollect user input and provide feedback to users. Traditionally, userinput has been done in the PSTN through DTMF. Much work has occurredon extending these DTMF models into the domain of SIP, typically bytransporting DTMF digits or user input through some SIP message to anapplication server. We propose a broader framework for stimulus usingmarkup. The approach can support traditional DTMF user input, butalso a rich variety of devices, user interfaces and stimulus thatgoes well beyond DTMF.</t>
