      <t>In order for SIP applications to work, they will frequently need to collect user input and provide feedback to users. Traditionally, user input has been done in the PSTN through DTMF. Much work has occurred on extending these DTMF models into the domain of SIP, typically by transporting DTMF digits or user input through some SIP message to an application server. We propose a broader framework for stimulus using markup. The approach can support traditional DTMF user input, but also a rich variety of devices, user interfaces and stimulus that goes well beyond DTMF.</t>
