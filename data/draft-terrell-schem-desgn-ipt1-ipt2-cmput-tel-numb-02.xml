      <t>This paper focuses upon the simplification of the presentation for Defining the New Schematic of what was called the IPv7 and IPv8 IP Protocol Specifications. Which is accomplished by first, Renaming these Protocols to 'IPt1' and 'IPt2', where the 't' represents 'Tele-Communications-Specification'. And second, by eliminating either all, or most of the extraneous information, which is not essential (at least not anymore) for understanding the overall Schematic Structure, nor the benefits, these Protocol Specifications actually represent. Which is further emphasized with a comparison, that uses The New and the Modern Binary Systems. Where is it shown that an increase in efficiency still exist, while the Number of IP Addresses remains Astronomically Large in both cases. In other words, the 'IPt1' and 'IPt2' IP Specifications represents a format, which is nothing more than a 'Telephone Number Implementation' that can be used as the primary IP Addressing format in any Telecommunications System, regardless of the choice for the Method in Binary Enumeration. Which means, in essence, this a Telecommunications Protocol that is essentially the 'Computer's Telephone Number'.</t>
