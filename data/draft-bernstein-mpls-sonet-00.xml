      <t>In [Awduche] the MPLS Traffic Engineering control plane was applied to the creation of light paths (optical circuits). Due to the general hierarchical capabilities of MPLS, and the flexibility of the label switching paradigm the same techniques used to apply the MPLS control plane to the optical layer can be used to apply it to the SONET/SDH path layer and in fact any form of circuit switching. This note discusses advantages of such an approach and some of the issues involved in its application.</t>
