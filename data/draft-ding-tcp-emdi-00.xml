      <t>This document introduces an Enhanced Media Delivery Index (eMDI) that can be used as a diagnostic tool or a quality indicator for monitoring a network intended to deliver streaming media over TCP transport. It aims to address the problems that RFC4445 has when measuring in environments where TCP traffic is dominated as a transport for streaming media.</t>
