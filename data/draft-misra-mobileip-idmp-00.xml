      <t>This document introduces IDMP, a mobility protocol that supports routing of datagrams to a mobile node inside a mobility domain. A mobility domain essentially identifies a collection of IP subnets and networks that are aggregated together based on factors such as geographic proximity or administrative control. In addition to supporting basic redirection of packets to mobile nodes, IDMP also provides fast handoff support, with minimal packet losses due to mobility-related transients, and paging support to reduce the signaling burden on mobile nodes. IDMP uses two care-of addresses to manage mobility. The global care-of address identifies the mobile's current domain and remains unchanged as long as the mobile does not change domains. The local care-of address identifies the mobile's current point of attachment and changes every time a mobile node changes subnets. IDMP specifies two types of agents, Subnet Agents and Mobility Agents, to support this two-layer mobility hierarchy. By using two care-of addresses , IDMP removes the need for host-specific routing inside the domain and allows the use of multiple alternative protocols for supporting global mobility.</t>
