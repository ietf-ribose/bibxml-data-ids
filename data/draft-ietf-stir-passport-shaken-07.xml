      <t>This document extends PASSporT, which is a token object that conveys cryptographically-signed information about the participants involved in communications. The extension is defined, corresponding to the SHAKEN specification, to provide both a specific set of levels-of- confidence in the correctness of the originating identity for a SIP based Communication Service Provider (CSP) telephone network originated call as well as an identifier that allows the CSP to uniquely identify the origin of the call within its network.</t>
