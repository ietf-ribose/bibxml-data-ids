      <t>This document describes how the Real-time Transport Protocol, RTP (RFC1889), could be extended to include support for parts of the framework called Scalable Reliable Multicast. The scheme proposed could be used for transporting a data flow reliably over the transport protocols supported by RTP in a light-weight way. This could be used for numerous applications, for instance white-boards, semi-reliable audio/video and messaging/data-transfers within group-ware applications.</t>
