      <t>This document specifies the schemas and models required to realize the data formats and interfaces for Intent-Based Networking (IBN). They are needed to enable the composition of services to build a translation engine for IBN-based network management. This intent translation engine (called an intent translator) is an essential function for network intents to be enforced into a target network for the configuration and management of the network and its security.</t>
