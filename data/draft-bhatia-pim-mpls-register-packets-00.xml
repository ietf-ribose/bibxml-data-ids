      <t>In PIM-SM the designated router (DR) closest to the source keepssending PIM register packets till it receives an explicit Register-Stop message from the rendezvous point (RP) router. The process ofencapsulating multicast data traffic to the RP, and the decapsulationdone by RP are relatively expensive operations for a router toperform, depending upon whether or not the router has appropriatehardware support for these tasks.Since the PIM register messages are native IP packets and routedbased on IP forwarding tables no resource reservation mechanisms areavailable. All IP packets will follow common paths that are definedby the traditional IGP's algorithm and customizing the path formulticast applications is impossible.This document proposes using MPLS tunnel(s) to send traffic from thesource to the RP till the shortest path tree (SPT) from the RP to thesource is established. Processing MPLS packets is easy and isreadily supported on most platforms.</t>
