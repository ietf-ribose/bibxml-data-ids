      <t>This document describes the current thinking of the collaborators of ITU-T Question 10/2, 'Management and development of PSTN-based telecommunication services,' about service principles when public circuit switched international telecommunication networks interwork with IP-based networks. This document contains most of the text (there has been some rearrangement of the text) from draft new Recommendation E.370 [1], starting from section 3 of this Internet Draft, which was determined to be stable at the March 2000 meeting of Study Group 2. It may be approved by the members of the ITU, subject to written comments received from those members, at a meeting of the Study Group (or its successor) in early 2001 (provisionally 23-26 January 2001). It is hoped that this document will further the collaborative efforts between Study Group 2 and the various working groups of the IETF.</t>
