    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes extensions for IGP to order to advertise the aggregate header limit of a node or a link on a node to for efficient packet processing. Aggregate header limit is the total header size(e.g, in IPv6, it includes the IPv6 header chain as well as any headers that are part of network encapsulation that precedes the innermost transport layer) that a router is able to process at full forwarding rate, for some devices, this limit is related with its buffer size and buffer design.</t>
