    <abstract>
      <t>In PIM-SM networks PIM Null-Register messages are sent by the Designated Router (DR) to the Rendezvous Point (RP) to signal the presence of Multicast sources in the network. There are periodic PIM Null-Registers sent from the DR to the RP to keep the state alive at the RP as long as the source is active. The PIM Null-Register message carries information about a single Multicast source and group. This document defines a standard to send multiple Multicast source and group information in a single PIM Packed Null-Register message. We will refer to the new packed formats as the PIM Packed Null- Register format and PIM Packed Register-Stop format throughout the document. This document also discusses interoperability between the PIM routers which do not understand the PIM Packed Null-Register format and routers which do understand it.</t>
