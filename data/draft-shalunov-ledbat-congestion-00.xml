      <t>LEDBAT is an alternative experimental congestion control algorithm.LEDBAT enables an advanced networking application to minimize theextra delay it induces in the bottleneck while saturating thebottleneck. It thus implements an end-to-end version of scavengerservice. LEDBAT has been been implemented in BitTorrent DNA, as theexclusive congestion control mechanism, and in uTorrent, as anexperimental mechanism, and deployed in the wild with favorableresults.</t>
