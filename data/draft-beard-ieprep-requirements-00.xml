      <t>This document outlines requirements that need to be met in IP-based networks to enable and support communications for National Security/Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) operations. It provides a template from which an emergency service can be negotiated and provides a set of requirements that should be met for acceptable emergency communication services. The focus here is on network requirements, rather than requirements for particular applications. The requirements are general and are intended to provide wide latitude in implementation options for service providers.</t>
