      <t>The Reilly Resilience Protocol (RRP) standardizes a verifiable method to prove that IT systems, cloud infrastructures, and AI pipelines are continuously exercised and resilient. RRP turns resilience claims into cryptographically signed evidence persisted in immutable storage and batched into a daily Merkle root that is publicly time-anchored on blockchains. The protocol outputs an executive Resilience Scorecard backed by independently verifiable receipts. RRP composes with the Reilly EternaMark (REM) protocol to ensure dual-layer digital permanence using both DOI archival and blockchain timestamping.</t>
