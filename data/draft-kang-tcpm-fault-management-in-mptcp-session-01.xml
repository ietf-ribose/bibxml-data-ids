    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents a mechanism for fault management during a MPTCP session. It is used to convey subflow failure information from client to server by other subflow running normally. It includes: 1) a new Fault Announce Option for describing subflow failure, 2) implementation and interoperability of this option during a MPTCP session when one subflow suffers a failure. In fact, the server is able to determine network problems accurately based on these fault information reported from multiple clients for their connections.</t>
