    <abstract>
      <t>A switching fabric in a massive scale data center can comprise many 10,000's of switches and 100,000's of IP hosts. To connect and configure a network of such size needs automation to avoid errors. Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) protocols exist. These can configure IP devices that are reachable by the ZTP agents. A method to combine BGP, DHCPv6 and SRv6 with ZTP that can be used to configure an entire network of devices is described. It is designed to scale well, because each networked device is not required to know about more than its directly connected neighborhood.</t>
