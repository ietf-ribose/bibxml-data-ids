      <t>This draft describes IBM's support for running LU6.2 applications over a TCP/IP network. This support is provided using a subset of the X/Open architecture for Multiprotocol Transport Networking, which is a general protocol conversion architecture for running any application over any transport protocol. This draft is being distributed to members of the Internet community in order to solicit their reactions to the proposals contained in it. While the issues discussed may not be directly relevant to the research problems of the Internet, they may be interesting to a number of researchers and implementers. Any questions or comments relative to the contents of this draft should be sent to the following Internet address: carmich@us.ibm.com.</t>
