      <t>This memo describes a peer-to-peer protocol to set up shortcut paths in an environment where an internetworking (L3) protocol, such as IP, overlays a link-layer (L2) protocol such as ATM. In such a network, L3 routing is the default mechanism for data transfer but it is also possible to set up direct L2 paths such as ATM VCs, that bypass L3 routing, so as to expedite the transfer of data. The protocol described in this memo can be applied as an inter-LIS (Logical IP Subnetwork) shortcut protocol when an L2 subnetwork is configured into multiple LISs. It can also be used as an independent protocol to set up direct L2 paths. In this way, it operates without L2 address resolution servers and allows the use of conventional routers (those without address resolution function) in the network. Therefore, it is useful for networks that have no available L2 address resolution service.</t>
