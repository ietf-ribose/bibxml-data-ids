      <t>This document describes the use of RSVP [RSVP, RSVP-TE] to establishshared protection LSP tunnels.The method presented enables the set up and reservation of resourcesof protection LSPs while sharing the network protection bandwidth.The described use of RSVP allows the protection LSP to be establishedwithout changes to a pre-existing OSPF-TE protocol. Of course, A 'TE'routing protocol is not required, but would be desirable as it wouldreduce the number of crank-backs. In the companion draft [Shared-OSPF-TE], extensions to OSPF/OSPF-TE are presented that enablefurther optimized operations to support efficient sharing ofprotection bandwidth.</t>
