      <t>This document describes the use of RSVP [RSVP, RSVP-TE] to establish shared protection LSP tunnels. The method presented enables the set up and reservation of resources of protection LSPs while sharing the network protection bandwidth. The described use of RSVP allows the protection LSP to be established without changes to a pre-existing OSPF-TE protocol. Of course, A 'TE' routing protocol is not required, but would be desirable as it would reduce the number of crank-backs. In the companion draft [Shared- OSPF-TE], extensions to OSPF/OSPF-TE are presented that enable further optimized operations to support efficient sharing of protection bandwidth.</t>
