      <t>A key part of the behavior of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)is that SIP proxies rewrite the Request-URI as a request movesthroughout the network. Over the years, experience has shown this tobe problematic. It makes it difficult to use Request URI for serviceinvocation, complicates emergency services, makes it more complex tosupport aliases, and so on. Architecturally, it confounds theconcepts of address and route. This document proposes to change thisthrough a new mechanism called UA loose routing.</t>
