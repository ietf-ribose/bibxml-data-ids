      <t>This document specifies a new BGP attribute, called the BGP-4 Multiprotocol Next Hop (MP_NEXT_HOP), which can optionally be used in conjunction with the MP_REACH_NLRI defined in [MP-BGP] (or the NLRI field defined in BGP-4) to advertise next hop information associated with a different Network Layer protocol to the one associated with the NLRI. This is desirable or required in a number of environments, but is not currently possible with [MP-BGP]. In addition, the MP_NEXT_HOP provides the generic capability to advertise information (set of TLVs) associated with the next hop. Finally, provision is made for a future potential extension to allow advertisement of multiple next hops.</t>
