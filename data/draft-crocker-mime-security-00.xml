      <t>MIME is the preferred Internet mechanism for labeling and aggregating bulk data objects, such as for email and the web, and it is essential to have useful, MIME-based mechanisms. Indeed, two standards have existed for some years: OpenPGP and S/MIME. A current IESG policy for new application protocols requires that they mandate conforming implementations to support a single security mechanism. For applications using MIME security, this means that the specification is required to choose between S/MIME and OpenPGP.Although well-intentioned, the policy is at least useless and at worstcounter-productive. This note discusses the problem and suggests returning to the previously acceptable policy that better reflects the lack of market resolve for MIME security.</t>
