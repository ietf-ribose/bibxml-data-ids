      <t>This document defines the Extensible Peer Protocol (XPP), alightweight binary protocol for end-to-end sessions between peers indistributed overlay networks. One of the main goals while creatingthis protocol was support for nodes located behind firewalls andNATs. XPP therefore uses UDP and allows endpoints to simultaneouslyinitiate sessions. Given the choice of the underlying protocol(UDP), XPP also defines mechanisms for message fragmentation andreliability.</t>
