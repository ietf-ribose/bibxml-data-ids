      <t>This document describes the limitation of present TSCH cell scheduling methods which use centralized or decentralized approach. It firstly overview pros and cons of various cell scheduling approaches including centralized, decentralized and autonomous TSCH cell scheduling methods. It also suggest design considerations on devising autonomous scheduling approach to avoid unexpected confliction and increase channel utilization. For the last, it provides one example that reflects all design considerations mentioned.</t>
