      <t>Bit Index Explicit Replication (BIER) is a new multicast forwarding architecture which doesn't require an explicit tree-building protocol and doesn't require intermediate routers to maintain any multicast state. BIER is applicable in a multi-tenant data center network envioronment for efficient delivery of Broadcast, Unknown-unicast and Multicast (BUM) traffic while eliminating the need for maitaining a huge amount of multicast state in an underlay. This document describes BGP extensions for advertising the BIER-specific information. These extesnions are applicable in those multi-tenant data centers where BGP instead of IGP is deployed as an underlay for network reachability advertisement. These extensions may also be applicable in other scenarios.</t>
