    <abstract>
      <t>A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual network which has a customized network topology and a set of dedicated or shared network resources allocated from the underlying network infrastructure. Multiple VTNs can be created by network operator for using as the underlay for one or a group of VPNs services to provide enhanced VPN (VPN+) services. In packet forwarding, some fields in the data packet needs to be used to identify the VTN the packet belongs to, so that the VTN-specific processing can be executed. This document proposes a mechanism to carry the VTN-ID in an MPLS packet to identify the VTN the packet belongs to. The procedure for processing the VTN ID is also specified.</t>
