    <abstract>
      <t>This document generalizes and extends the use of DNS NOTIFY (RFC 1996) beyond conventional zone transfer hints, to allow triggering other types of actions via the DNS that were previously lacking a trigger mechanism. Notifications merely nudge the receiver to initiate a predefined action promptly (instead of on a schedule); they do not alter the action itself (including any security checks it might employ). To enable this functionality, a method for discovering the receiver endpoint for such notification messages is introduced, via the new DSYNC record type. Notification types are recorded in a new registry, with initial support for parental NS and DS record updates including DNSSEC bootstrapping. TO BE REMOVED: This document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/peterthomassen/draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized-notify (https://github.com/peterthomassen/draft-ietf-dnsop-generalized- notify). The most recent working version of the document, open issues, etc. should all be available there. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests.</t>
