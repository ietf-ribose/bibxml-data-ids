If one DHCP server wishesto offer service to DHCP clients on those different VPNs the DHCPserver needs to know the VPN on which each client resides. The vpn-id sub-option of the relay-agent-information option is used by therelay agent to tell the DHCP server the VPN for every DHCP request itpasses on to the DHCP server, and is also used to properly forwardany DHCP reply that the DHCP server sends back to the relay agent.</t>
