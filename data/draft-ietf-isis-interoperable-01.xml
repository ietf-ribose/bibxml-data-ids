      <t>In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But in practice, there is. Jan L.A. van de Snepscheut This document discusses a number of differences between the IS-IS protocol as described in ISO 10589 [1] and RFC 1195 [3] and the protocol as it is deployed today. These differences are discussed as a service to those implementing, testing, and deploying the IS-IS Protocol to route IP traffic.</t>
