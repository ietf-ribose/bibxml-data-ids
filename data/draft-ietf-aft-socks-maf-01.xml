    <abstract>
      <t>SOCKS V5 [RFC 1928] provides a means to select one from among a number of authentication methods but does not provide any means for utilizing multiple authentication methods to obtain certain desired authentication properties. MAF is a client-initiated but server-managed framework. MAF relies on a trusted Authentication Management Server (AMS) to: 1) Select the authentication methods to be invoked, 2) order the execution of methods at the client, as appropriate, and 3) assign integrity grades to the final, composite authentication after all methods that were invoked have completed.</t>
