    <abstract>
      <t>Source address spoofing remains a significant challenge in today's Internet. Although source address validation (SAV) mechanisms, such as ingress filtering [RFC2827], unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF)[RFC3704], and the Enhanced Feasible-Path Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (EFP-uRPF) [RFC8704], have been proposed for a long time, none of them have been widely deployed due to their technical limitations, lack of incentive, or other problems. This document specifically explains the incentive problem of existing SAV mechanisms and clarifies the incentive that SAVNET hopes to achieve.</t>
