      <t>IKEv2 is a popular protocol for setting up VPN tunnels from a remotelocation to a gateway so that the VPN client can access services inthe network behind the gateway. Currently there is no standardmechanism specified that allows an overloaded VPN gateway to re-direct the VPN client to attach to another gateway. This documentproposes a re-direct mechanism for IKEv2. The proposed mechanism canalso be used for Mobile IPv6 to enable the home agent to re-directthe mobile node to another home agent.</t>
