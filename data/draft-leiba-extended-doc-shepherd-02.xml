      <t>RFC 4858 talks about "Document Shepherding from Working Group Last Call to Publication". There's a significant part of a document's life that happens before working group last call, starting, really, at the time a working group begins discussing a version of the idea that's been posted as an individual draft. It seems reasonable and helpful in many situations to begin shepherding when there's a call for adoption as a working group document. This document extends RFC 4858, describing how that extended shepherding function might work and what tasks might be involved throughout the document's lifecycle, and suggesting how Working Group Chairs might choose to implement extended shepherding.</t>
