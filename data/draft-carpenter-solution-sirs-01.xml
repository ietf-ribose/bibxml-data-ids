      <t>IETF specifications may not receive significant review, especially beyond a single working group, until they are submitted to the IESG. Hence, significant problems with a specification often are not detected until a problematic approach has been adopted and considerable effort has been spent developing and documenting this approach. Major changes to address problems identified late in the process take considerable effort and significantly delay a document that its authors believed to be ready for publication. The procedure described in this document is intended to solve, or palliate, a number of related problems that have been observed in the IETF process. The basic model is to create a team of Senior IETF Reviewers (SIRS), and have all documents receive a certain number of reviews by SIRs, prior to being submitted for publication. Review by SIRs at a very early stage is strongly encouraged.</t>
