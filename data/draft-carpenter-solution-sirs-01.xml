      <t>IETF specifications may not receive significant review,especially beyond a single working group, until theyare submitted to the IESG. Hence, significant problemswith a specification often are not detected until aproblematic approach has been adopted and considerableeffort has been spent developing and documenting thisapproach. Major changes to address problems identifiedlate in the process take considerable effort andsignificantly delay a document that its authorsbelieved to be ready for publication. The proceduredescribed in this document is intended to solve, orpalliate, a number of related problems that have beenobserved in the IETF process. The basic model is tocreate a team of Senior IETF Reviewers (SIRS), and haveall documents receive a certain number of reviews bySIRs, prior to being submitted for publication. Reviewby SIRs at a very early stage is strongly encouraged.</t>
