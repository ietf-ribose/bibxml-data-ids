      <t>This document specifies an attribute for attestation to the possession of a private key. As part of X.509 certificate enrollment, a Certification Authority (CA) typically demands proof that the subject has possession of the private key that corresponds to the to-be-certified public key. In some cases, CAs might accept an attestation from the subject. For example, when a subject needs separate certificates for a signature and key establishment, an attestation that can be validated with the previously issued signature certificate might be adequate for subsequent issuance of the key establishment certificate.</t>
