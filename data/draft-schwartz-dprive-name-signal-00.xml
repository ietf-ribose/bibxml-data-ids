    <abstract>
      <t>Some recent proposals to the DPRIVE working group rely on the use of SVCB records to provide instructions about how to reach an authoritative nameserver over an encrypted transport. These proposals will be difficult to deploy until the parent domain's delegation software has been modified to support these records. As an interim solution for these domains, this draft proposes encoding relevant signals in the child's NS-name.</t>
