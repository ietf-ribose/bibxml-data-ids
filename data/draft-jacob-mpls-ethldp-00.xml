      <t>MPLS is the heart and soul of the service provider network. MPLS can carryanydata payload which gives the flexibility to the service provider to provision new servicewith any expense. The benefit of this technology is core router need not understand thefull customer route. If the service a layer 2 then thereis no need of vrf, for customer theservice provider cloud is like a virtual switch.The protocol used for label distribution is LDP,BGP,RSVP. The most popular protocol for outer label distribution is LDP. LDP has the benefit ofadding more TLV to its payload. In this the possibility of using ldp for generating labelsfor mac address rather for ip address which gives the benefit to service provider not torun complex routing protocol on core, this does not require ip address. This gives serviceprovider the flexibility to deploy any services, there is no need for changes in network layer when thecustomer goes for ipv4 to ipv6. This can reduce the CAPEX and OPEX of the customer and reduces thehardware cost too.</t>
