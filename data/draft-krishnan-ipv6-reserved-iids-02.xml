      <t>Interface Identifiers in IPv6 unicast addresses are used to identifyinterfaces on a link. They are required to be unique within asubnet. Several RFCs have specified interface identifiers oridentifier ranges that have a special meaning attached to them. AnIPv6 node autoconfiguring an interface identifier in these rangeswill encounter unexpected consequences. Since there is nocentralized repository for such reserved identifiers, this documentaims to create one.</t>
