    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes an architecture for secure IP multicast. It identifies the basic components and their functionalities, and specifies how these components interact with each other and with the surrounding systems. The main design principles followed in developing this architecture are simplicity, flexibility, ease of incorporation within existing systems. In particular, the design attempts to mimic the IPSec architecture, and to re-use existing IPSec mechanisms wherever possible. The proposed architecture is able to accommodate many of the existing proposals for multicast key management. In this draft, we concentrate on the architectural building blocks required to enable a group member (either a receiver or a sender of data) to use secure IP multicast. Design of the group controller(s) is left to future documents.</t>
