      <t>This document defines which algorithm specific parameters are needed for elliptic curve cipher (ECC) and elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) and how they have to be stored in openPGP packets. Therefore it is an supplement to the openPGP message format [1]. It also defines which checks are needed to validate ECC and ECDSA keys and which 'top-level' operations must be performed for encryption/decryption and signing/signature verification. But it gives no advices how to implement these checks and operations, nor the underlying mathematics. To do this, look for example at IEEE P1363 [2].</t>
