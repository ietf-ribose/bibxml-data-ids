      <t>This document defines which algorithm specific parameters are neededfor elliptic curve cipher (ECC) and elliptic curve digital signaturealgorithm (ECDSA) and how they have to be stored in openPGP packets.Therefore it is an supplement to the openPGP message format [1].It also defines which checks are needed to validate ECC and ECDSAkeys and which 'top-level' operations must be performed forencryption/decryption and signing/signature verification. But itgives no advices how to implement these checks and operations, northe underlying mathematics. To do this, look for example at IEEEP1363 [2].</t>
