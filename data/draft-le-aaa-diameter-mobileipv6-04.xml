      <t>Mobile IPv6 capable mobile nodes can roam between networks that belong to their home service provider as well as others. Roaming in foreign networks is enabled as a result of the service level and roaming agreements that exist between operators. One of the key protocols that allows this kind of a roaming mechanism to be enabled is Diameter. This Internet Draft specifies a new application to Diameter that enables Mobile IPv6 roaming in networks other than its home.</t>
