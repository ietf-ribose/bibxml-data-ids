      <t>This memo describes the Binary Low-Overhead Block (BLOB) protocol for on-the-wire presentation of data in the context of higher-level protocols. BLOB is designed to encode and decode data with low overhead on most CPUs, to be reasonably space-efficient, and for its representation to be sufficiently precise that it is suitable as a canonical format for digital signatures.</t>
