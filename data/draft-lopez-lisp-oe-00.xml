      <t>The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP), allows the creation of VPNs between routing locators (RLOCs). As LISP encapsulated packets are generally expected to traverse publically routed spaces, it is desirable to encrypt the payloads of these packets, to protect them from pervasive surveillance attacks. This document describes a methodology to encrypt LISP encapsulated packets, as they traverse between RLOCs. For a full description of LISP, please consult [RFC6830].</t>
