      <t>This draft presents the requirements of burst-level control in order to improve channel efficiency in optical networks. By processing and control the finer granularity of burst data, the network can improve its utilization than the present circuit switching based optical networks. Implementation issues of transmission and switching for data burst are took into consideration.</t>
