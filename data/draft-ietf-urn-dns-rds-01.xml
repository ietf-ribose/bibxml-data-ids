      <t>The architectural principles laid out in RFC2276[9] defines theconcept of a 'resolver discovery service'. This document describesan immediately-deployable RDS. It is implemented by a new DNSResource Record, NAPTR (Naming Authority PoinTeR)[10], that providesa method for encoding incrementally discovered rules within DNS. Byusing these incrementally discovered rules to re-map parts of a URI,we can change the host that is contacted to resolve a URI. Thiswill allow a more graceful handling of URLs over long time periods,and forms the foundation for a new proposal for Uniform ResourceNames.</t>
