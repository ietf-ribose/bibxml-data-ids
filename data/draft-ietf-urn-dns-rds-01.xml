      <t>The architectural principles laid out in RFC2276[9] defines the concept of a 'resolver discovery service'. This document describes an immediately-deployable RDS. It is implemented by a new DNS Resource Record, NAPTR (Naming Authority PoinTeR)[10], that provides a method for encoding incrementally discovered rules within DNS. By using these incrementally discovered rules to re-map parts of a URI, we can change the host that is contacted to resolve a URI. This will allow a more graceful handling of URLs over long time periods, and forms the foundation for a new proposal for Uniform Resource Names.</t>
