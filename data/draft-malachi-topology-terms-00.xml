      <t>This draft proposes a common nomenclature for use by the Physical Topology MIB Working Group. This glossary is based on the terms used in the various Internet Drafts submitted to this working group as well as on some RFCs. As we move forward with the definition of a common topology MIB this glossary will evolve to reflect the new constructs in the MIB and this draft will probably become a section in the Physical Topology MIB Internet Draft. Although a topology MIB will include many terms we include here only terms which are not well-defined elsewhere or might be confusing here.</t>
