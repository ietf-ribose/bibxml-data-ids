      <t>This document suggests that a link-local address used by a router as a source address for Router Advertisement packets is calculated as a function of prefixes listed in the Prefix Information Option of the Router Advertisement. The proposed approach, combined with the Rule 5.5 of the Default Source Address Selection algorithm (RFC6724) and first-hop selection requirements for hosts (RFC 8028) improves the robustness of the SLAAC by allowing the hosts to detect the IPv6 subnet changes much faster and select the correct source address.</t>
