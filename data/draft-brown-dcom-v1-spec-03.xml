      <t>The Distributed Component Object Model protocol is an application-level protocol for object-oriented remote procedure calls useful for distributed, component-based systems of all types. It is a generic protocol layered on the distributed computing environment (DCE) RPC specification and facilitates the construction of task-specific communication protocols through features such as: a platform neutral argument/parameter marshaling format (NDR), the ability for objects to support multiple interfaces with a safe, interface- level versioning scheme suited to independent evolution by multiple parties, the ability to make authenticated connections and to choose levels of channel security, and a transport-neutral data representation for references (including by-value) to objects.</t>
