      <t>The Distributed Component Object Model protocol is an application-levelprotocol for object-oriented remote procedure calls useful for distributed,component-based systems of all types. It is a generic protocol layered on thedistributed computing environment (DCE) RPC specification and facilitates theconstruction of task-specific communication protocols through features suchas: a platform neutral argument/parameter marshaling format (NDR), theability for objects to support multiple interfaces with a safe, interface-level versioning scheme suited to independent evolution by multiple parties,the ability to make authenticated connections and to choose levels of channelsecurity, and a transport-neutral data representation for references(including by-value) to objects.</t>
