      <t>This document provides a summary of previously identified problems with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) process for developing standards and other specifications; and then identifies a set of goals to aim at, and guidelines that should be followed during any activity seeking to revise and update this process. It does not propose specific changes to the process, which should be the subject of future documents.</t>
