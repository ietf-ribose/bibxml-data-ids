      <t>This document defines an extension to the SIP protocol to allow it be used in adhoc networks or Pico Networks. It leverages the direct, client to client session initiation capabilities of SIP, although there may be applications where the redirect and proxying abilities will be important also. Note the intention is not to imply that SIP is inherently the best protocol for such networks, but to recognize that there will likely be many SIP based applications in existence and that it would be good to allow these applications work with as little change as possible in this different type of network.</t>
