      <t>The document describes a SingleSignON solution to WWW seen as one Giant computer. As WWW use increases, on average an user has many service login accounts they have to manage. It would be better for most users at the expense of some security risk to have one password for all the services and a WWW shell and a control panel. Also the WWW as an intelligent being could show information to an user interpreting their needs from all their accounts. A smartcard could have a phone SIM slot and phone devices and computers can have smartcard slots and email user should be able to allow login only by insertion of smartcards.</t>
