      <t>The MIPSHOP working group is working on common functionalitynecessary for the support of media independent handover (MIH)protocols, initially focussing on the architectures being developedwith the 802.21 working group of the IEEE. A problem statement draftdescribing the context and scope of the common functionality isalready in progress, and a second draft has been prepared thatdescribes the main protocol design issues that have to be taken intoconsideration. Although the common functionality (relating totransport and security requirements) is mainly standard, there isstill a significant element of protocol design to integrate them withthe MIH service itself, including in particular secure peer discoveryand capability negotiation. This draft presents a solution for thecommon protocol functionality based on the use of the GeneralInternet Signaling Transport (GIST) protocol, which has beendeveloped in the NSIS working group. GIST can already satisfy thebulk of the protocol requirements in its current form, and this draftexplains how this existing GIST functionality fits into the MIHproblem space. The main special requirements for MIH relate tosignalling node discovery and message routing, and this draftoutlines three options for supporting these requirements within theGIST framework</t>
