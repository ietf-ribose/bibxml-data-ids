      <t>Packet switching network MAY contain links with variable discrete bandwidth, e.g., copper, radio, etc. The bandwidth of such link MAY change discretely in reaction to changing external environment. Availability is typically used for describing such links during network planning. This document describes an extension for OSPF routing for route computation in a Packet Switched Network (PSN) which contains links with variable discrete bandwidth by introducing an OPTIONAL Availability sub-TLV.</t>
