    <abstract>
      <t>This draft describes a generic associated channel header (GE-ACH) that provides a control channel associated with an MPLS LSP, pseudowire or MPLS section. The VCCV ACH defined for PWs in RFC 5085 is generalized to allow a larger set of control channel and OAM functions to be used to meet the requirements of packet transport and other applications of MPLS. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].</t>
