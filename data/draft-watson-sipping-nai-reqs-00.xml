      <t>There is no requirement for identities identities asserted by a UA in a SIP message to be anything other than the userâ€™s desired alias. An authenticated identity of a user can be obtained using SIP authentication, however it is unlikely that the necessary Public Key Infrastructure to facilitate this for UAs will be available soon. A Network Asserted Identity is an identity obtained by a SIP network intermediary as a result of an authentication process. This draft describes short term requirements for the exchange of Network Asserted Identities within networks of securely interconnected trusted nodes and to User Agents securely connected to such networks. General requirements for transport of Network Asserted Identities on the Internet are out of scope of this draft.</t>
