      <t>This contribution proposes modifications to the LDP and CR-LDP protocols that allow an LDP or CR-LDP session to be reestablished using a new TCP connection if the old TCP connection goes down unexpectedly. It also proposes that, in certain situations, an LSR continue to use the label bindings associated with a session for a short time after the session goes down, to allow forwarding to continue uninterrupted while the two peer LSRs attempt to reestablish the session. These modifications allow an LSR to easily implement hitless software upgrades and hitless activity switches.</t>
