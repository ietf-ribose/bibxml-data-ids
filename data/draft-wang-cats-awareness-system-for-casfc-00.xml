    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the Information Awareness System of the Computing-Aware Service Function Chain (ISA-CASFC) from the security service aspect, including the system architecture, network, and computing information details. The SFC enables traffic to pass through the ordered Network Security Function (NSF) path, enabling end-to-end security services. Differences in the available network and computing resources cause performance differences between NSF instances deployed on different service sites. It can be seen that the routing decision on NSF instances will affect the quality of the security service. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the CA-SFC to ensure the quality of security service. This document extends the CATS framework and the CATS Computing and Network Information Awareness (CNIA) architecture for CA-SFC, and describes the network and computing information content for security service.</t>
