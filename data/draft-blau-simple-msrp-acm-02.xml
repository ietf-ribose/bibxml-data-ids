      <t>This document defines an alternative connection model for MSRP UAs.The model differs from the standard MSRP model, as defined in RFC4975and RFC4976 in the following ways: it uses COMEDIA for TCP connectionestablishment, and it allows the usage of SDP in a more conventionalway for conveying endpoint address information. Because of this, themodel also allows for the usage of generic mainstream mechanisms forNAT traversal, instead of using MSRP relays.</t>
