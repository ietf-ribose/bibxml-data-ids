      <t>This document presents a simple strawman for CDN interconnection, and uses the strawman as a basis for articulating a set of design principles and exploring (parts of) the CDNI design space. Our intent is to spur discussion about what information needs to be exchanged between CDN peers, which is a prerequisite for crafting interfaces and protocols to communicate that information.</t>
