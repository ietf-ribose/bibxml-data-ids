      <t>This document specifies the MyClerk Protocol, a tiered-security communication protocol designed for distributed family orchestration systems. The protocol provides six security tiers ranging from 1-byte minimal overhead for tunneled messages to 144-byte full security for critical operations. It supports multiple transport mechanisms including NATS, Matrix, WebSocket, and direct TCP, while maintaining end-to-end encryption using ChaCha20-Poly1305 and X25519 key exchange. The protocol is transport-agnostic, federation-capable, and optimized for environments ranging from resource-constrained IoT devices to full-featured desktop clients.</t>
