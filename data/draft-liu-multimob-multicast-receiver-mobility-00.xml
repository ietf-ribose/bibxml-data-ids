      <t>This document proposes the architecture and solution options for multicast receiver mobility. The discussions are restricted only to the receiver mobility with the assumption that the multicast source and network are stationary while the receiver is in the moving state. The suggestions are given on how to integrate mobile IP and fixed multicast protocols to provide the feasible solutions, which involves the aspects of mobile receiver registration, group membership management, tunnel or optimal multicast routing, and handover optimization. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].</t>
