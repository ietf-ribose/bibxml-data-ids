      <t>When SCTP was initially accepted as RFC2960 the Adler-32 checksum was specified to be used. However, inlight of issues raised in [STONE] it has been proposed that a more robust algorithm such as [CRC-32] be used instead. This poses compatibility problems for existing implementations of SCTP that are already using the Adler-32 algorithm for computing checksums. This document proposes a dynamic method to preserve backward compatibility between the two checksum algorithms.</t>
