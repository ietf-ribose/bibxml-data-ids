      <t>When SCTP was initially accepted as RFC2960 the Adler-32 checksumwas specified to be used. However, inlight of issues raised in [STONE] it has been proposed that a more robust algorithm such as[CRC-32] be used instead. This poses compatibility problems for existing implementations of SCTP that are already usingthe Adler-32 algorithm for computing checksums. This documentproposes a dynamic method to preserve backward compatibilitybetween the two checksum algorithms.</t>
