      <t>This document defines Access Router Information Protocol (ARIP) whereby a mobile host can improve the handoff performance by exchanging, in advance, the information among geographically adjacent access router(AR)s. This protocol does not need a certain assumption of network topology so that it can be applied to heterogeneous networks as well as homogeneous networks. This document also describes a framework to minimize the handoff latency with the aid of ARIP. Therefore, ARIP can be combined with the protocol such as Fast Handovers (for Mobile IPv6) which tries to minimize the handoff latency.</t>
