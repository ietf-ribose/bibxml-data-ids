      <t>This Internet Draft describes the major carrier's optical service requirements for the Automatically Switched Optical Networks (ASON) from both an end-user's as well as an operator's perspectives. Its focus is on the description of the service building blocks and service-related control plane functional requirements. The management functions for the optical services and their underlying networks are beyond the scope of this document.</t>
