      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is designed to provide mobility service tomobile nodes in the network domain which does not require the mobilenodes to be involved in IP mobility management. In other words, thePMIPv6 can transparently support roaming within a PMIPv6 domain, i.e.intra-domain roaming, to mobile nodes. However, if the mobile nodesmove to other PMIPv6 domains, the nodes should have additionalprotocols for the inter-domain roaming although the domains alsoprovide the transparent mobility. Hence, an inter-domain roamingsolution would be needed for providing transparent mobility to mobilenodes that only move around among PMIPv6 domains. This documentspecifies the inter-domain roaming controlled by the networksadopting the PMIPv6.</t>
