      <t>This document describes a payload format for the transport of MPEG-4 visual Elementary Streams, applicable for multimedia applications not restricted to the simple visual profile. It is an application of the format described in [1] to specialized cases of video which are applicable in the H.323 context (using for example MPEG-4 lay- ered streams). It is therefore intended to support advanced MPEG-4 visual profiles (simple scalable, core, main, N-bits profiles), by allowing protection against loss of key segments of the elementary streams. The simple scalable profile supports temporal and spatial scalability, features important for rate or congestion control on the Internet, especially in multicast. The core and the main visual profiles target multimedia applications on the Internet and allow, in addition to scalability, the usage of sprite objects and of arbitrary shape objects.</t>
