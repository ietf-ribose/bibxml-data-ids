      <t>RFC 3095 defines a Proposed Standard framework with profiles forRObust Header Compression (ROHC). Various concepts are introducedwithin the standard, which might be difficult to understand, andespecially how these relate to the surrounding environments whereheader compression may be used. This document aims at clarifying thearchitectural aspects of ROHC, discussing terms such as ROHCinstances, ROHC channels, ROHC feedback, ROHC contexts, and how theseterms relate to other terms like network elements and IP interfaces,commonly used when for example addressing MIB issues.</t>
