      <t>RFC 3095 defines a Proposed Standard framework with profiles for RObust Header Compression (ROHC). Various concepts are introduced within the standard, which might be difficult to understand, and especially how these relate to the surrounding environments where header compression may be used. This document aims at clarifying the architectural aspects of ROHC, discussing terms such as ROHC instances, ROHC channels, ROHC feedback, ROHC contexts, and how these terms relate to other terms like network elements and IP interfaces, commonly used when for example addressing MIB issues.</t>
