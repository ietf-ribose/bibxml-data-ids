      <t>TRILL can be implemented in data center networks, which requires high reliability and stability. Whenever the egress RBridges or links break down, the TRILL rerouting time depends on the IS-IS topology convergence time, which may do not meet data center service requirements in terms of resiliency. VRRP provides a redundancy mechanism to avoid single point of failure and fast switching over. This draft proposes to extend VRRP protocol to TRILL in data center networks.</t>
