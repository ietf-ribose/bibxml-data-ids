      <t>This document requests the allocation of a new IPv4 special-purpose address from the IANA IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry. The proposed address, 192.0.0.11/32, is intended to serve as a signal to IPv4 hosts in IPv6-only networks that the link-layer resolution for the default gateway should be derived from the IPv6 default gateway learned via IPv6 Router Advertisements and Neighbor Discovery. This approach enables IPv4 communication without requiring IPv4 subnets or the use of ARP. It maintains backward compatibility with existing IPv4 host software that expects a default gateway IP address, while avoiding the need to implement legacy link-layer protocols.</t>
