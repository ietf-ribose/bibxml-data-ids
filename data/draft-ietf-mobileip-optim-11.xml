      <t>Using the base Mobile IP protocol, all datagrams destined to a mobile node are routed through that mobile node's home agent, which then tunnels each datagram to the mobile node's current location. This document defines Route Optimization messages and extensions to the base protocol to optimize datagram routing to a mobile node. Using these protocol extensions, correspondent nodes may cache the binding of a mobile node, and then tunnel their datagrams for the mobile node directly to the care-of address, bypassing the mobile node's home agent. Extensions are also provided to allow datagrams in flight when a mobile node moves, and datagrams sent based on an out-of-date cached binding, to be forwarded directly to the mobile node's new binding.</t>
