      <t>The CAPWAP binding for 802.11 is specified by RFC5416 and it was based on IEEE 802-11.2007 standard. Several new amendments of 802.11 have been published since RFC5416 was published in 2009. 802.11n is one of those amendments and it has been widely used in real deployment. This document extends the CAPWAP binding for 802.11 to support 802.11n and also defines a power and channel auto configuration extension.</t>
