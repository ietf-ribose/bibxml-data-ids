      <t>RFC6513, RFC6514, and other RFCs describe protocols and procedures which a Service Provider (SP) may deploy in order offer Multicast Virtual Private Network (Multicast VPN or MVPN) service to its customers. Some of these procedures use BGP to distribute VPN- specific multicast routing information across a backbone network. With a small number of relatively minor modifications, the very same BGP procedures can also be used to distribute multicast routing information that is not specific to any VPN. Multicast that is outside the context of a VPN is known as "Global Table Multicast", or sometimes simply as "Internet multicast". In this document, we describe the modifications that are needed to use the MVPN BGP procedures for Global Table Multicast.</t>
