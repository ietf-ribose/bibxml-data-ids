      <t>Mobile IPv6 allows a MN to receive incoming packets to its home address while it is away from its home network. In a heterogeneous environment, a MN may have multiple interfaces, each with different characteristics. While a MN is in a visited network, due to the performance of the interfaces or to the user preferences, the MN may want to forbid the redirection from its home agent of a kind of flow, or to indicate a target CoA for a kind of flow. In this draft, we propose new mobility options that allow a MN to advertise filters to its home agent. A filter is associated with a CoA, in such a way that the MN can register several CoA and can register several filters for one CoA. A filter may indicate that a flow which maps to a filter must be dropped or must be redirected to the indicated CoA.</t>
