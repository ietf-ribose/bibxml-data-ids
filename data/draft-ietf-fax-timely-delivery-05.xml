    <abstract>
      <t>This specification provides a way to request timely completion for Internet mail delivery, for services such as facsimile and voice messaging. Traditional Internet mail uses a _postal_ mail model, with normal delivery having an indeterminate gap between delivery into a mailbox and processing by the recipient. Timely completion adds a timelines service feature and extends delivery processing all the way to the recipient. This specification provides a deterministic service quality response, while preserving most of the traditional roles and responsibilities of the agents involved in email transfers.</t>
