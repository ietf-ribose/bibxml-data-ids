    <abstract>
      <t>This specification indicates circumstances in which the sending of am unscheduled TC message by an OLSRv2 router is recommended or required rather than optional. It is motivated by the possible responsive use of OLSRv2 in a mostly stable network. The cases in which the message sending would be required are limited to such cases, and would require administrative configuration to establish such a network. This specification updates RFC 7181 "The Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2)".</t>
