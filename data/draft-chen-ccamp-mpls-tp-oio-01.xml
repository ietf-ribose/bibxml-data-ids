    <abstract>
      <t>Two formats of operator identifier are specified in Multi-Protocol Label Switching Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) networks, to uniquely identify an operator. One is Global_ID, the other is ICC_Operator_ID. In MPLS-TP networks, operator identifier as part of the global identifier of an MPLS-TP LSP may be required to be carried in the Path/Resv message when setting up the LSP. This document defines a new RSVP-TE Object: Operator Identifier object (OIO). It has two types, the Global_ID object and the ICC_Operator_ID object. Similar as Session and Sender Template object, OIO could be carried in the Path or Resv message to communicate the Operator ID that the two ends of an LSP in use. At the same time, it makes sure all the nodes that the LSP traverses to use the same format of Operator ID.</t>
