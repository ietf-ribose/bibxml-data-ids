      <t>This document specifies an experimental MPTCP option that is meant to negotiate the maximum number of subflows that can be established and maintained for a given MPTCP connection. The purpose is to minimize any possible performance degradation that can be induced by a possibly large number of establishment requests for additional subflows if the remote endpoint is not appropriateley dimensioned to handle such requests.</t>
