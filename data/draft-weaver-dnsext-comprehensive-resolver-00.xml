      <t>DNS resolvers are vulnerable to many attacks on their networkcommunication, ranging from blind attacks to full men-in-the-middle.Although a full man-in-the-middle can only be countered withcryptography, there are many layers of defenses which apply to lesspowerful attackers. Of particular interest are defenses which onlyrequire changing the DNS resolvers, not the authoritative servers orthe DNS protocols. This document begins with a taxonomy of attackercapabilities and desires, and then discusses defenses against classesof attackers, including detecting non-disruptive attacks, entropybudgeting, detecting entropy stripping, semantics of duplication, andcache policies to eliminate "race-until-win" conditions. Proposeddefenses were evaluated with traces of network behavior.</t>
