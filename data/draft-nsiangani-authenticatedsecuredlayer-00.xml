      <t>This document specifies ASL (Authenticated Secure Layer), a cryptographic protocol for establishing an authenticated and encrypted communication session based on a novel arithmetic primitive called phi-ns-x (also known as ns-mod). ASL provides a complete handshake and data transport layer without reliance on traditional algorithms like RSA, Diffie-Hellman, AES or SHA. Instead, it builds on the Phi-Ns cryptosystem, which defines a structured quadratic relation between primes and achieves security through non-linear modular arithmetic and combinatorial complexity. ASL includes an initial authentication and key exchange mechanism where a server public key (composed only of specific allowed elements such as a prime modulus and state parameters) is used by a client to establish shared secrets. The protocol uses a stateful encryption transform (phi-ns-x) for data, with each message round incorporating a public state value that changes unpredictably. Shared secret parameters control this state evolution, preventing man-in-the-middle and injection attacks by ensuring that only parties with knowledge of the secrets can produce valid ciphertexts.</t>
