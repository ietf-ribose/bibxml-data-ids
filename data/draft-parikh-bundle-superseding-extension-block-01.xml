      <t>This document defines an optional Bundle Protocol block called theSuperseding Bundle Extension Block (SBEB) for use with the BundleProtocol in the context of the Delay-Tolerant NetworkingArchitecture. Applications use this block to call for the removal ofpreviously sent bundles that are rendered obsolete by more recentbundles. Upon receiving a bundle with an SBEB, a node will searchits bundle store (and outbound queues) for bundles that are obsoletedby other related bundles according to their source and destinationEID, and the SBEB cookie (if present), and may delete some or all ofthem. Discarding obsolete bundles helps conserve storage space andprevents expending resources in further forwarding bundles that areno longer relevant. The bundle protocol already uses expirationtimes to remove bundles that are no longer useful to applications.The SBEB is a way for applications to mark bundles that a node maydelete prior to their expiration times.</t>
