      <t>This document addresses how to support fast handover in regional MIPv4 networks (Regional Hanover). The proposed regional handover scheme is designed based on the existing MIPv4 Post-Registration scheme in a more effective way that the regional MIPv4 features are exploited. In the proposed regional handover scheme, the GFA acts as an anchor FA and thus the bi-directional handover tunnels are established between GFA and nFA, not between oFA and nFA.</t>
