      <t>Currently, Information-Centric networking (ICN) becomes the hot spot to meet the new requirements accessing a large amount information through networks. ICN exists congestion which isn't well solved. The congestion control protocols in IP network aren't suitable for ICN transport, so we provide a new congestion control protocol-RRCP. RRCP based on XCP and ICN transport characteristics raises a receiver-driven, router-feedback, multi-request windows and timeout mechanisms. RRCP shows efficient, fair and stable via simulation results.</t>
