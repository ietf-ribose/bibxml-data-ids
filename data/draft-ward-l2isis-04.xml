      <t>This draft specifies the IS-IS extensions necessary to support multi-link IPv4 and IPv6 networks, as well as to provide true link staterouting to any protocols running directly over layer 2. Whilesupporting this concept involves several pieces, this document onlydescribes extensions to IS-IS. We leave it to the systems usingthese IS-IS extensions to explain how the information carried inIS-IS is used.1. OverviewThere are a number of systems (for example, [RBRIDGES]) which haveproposed using layer 2 addresses carried in a link state routingprotocol, specifically IS-IS [IS-IS] [RFC1195], to provide true layer2 routing in specific environments. This draft proposes a set ofTLVs and sub-TLVs to be added to [IS-IS] level 1 PDUs, and three newPDU types, to support these proposed systems.This draft does not propose new forwarding mechanisms using thisadditional information carried within IS-IS. There is a shortsection included on two possible ways to build a shortest path firsttree including this information, to illustrate how this informationmight be used.</t>
