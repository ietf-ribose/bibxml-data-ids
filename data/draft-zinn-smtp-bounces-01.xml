      <t>Current SMTP RFCs are interpreted by some as requiring non delivery notice to be sent, even when the "reverse-path" is forged by a virus. Some ISPs are now dropping such messages silently. Silent dropping of such messages should be encouraged under certain circumstances, however this should not be taken as a permananet carte-blanch to silently discard any message that one does not like.</t>
