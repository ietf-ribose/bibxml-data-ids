      <t>In the context of virtualization, a service essentially consists of a set of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) with each VNF building on top of virtualization infrastructure to implement a specific network functions along with the data connections between VNFs. VNFs may be highly distributed existing in devices in data center networks, mobile networks or satellite networks. In some of these environments, the resources are highly constrained. This draft provides seven use cases the author has observed in demonstrations or deployments for the following network function virtualization: cloud bursting, parental controls, load balancer for multipath (L1-L7), WAN optimization that runs either between access nodes and Data Centers, WAN optimization between mobile phones and Data Centers (through access nodes), application placement optimization, and optimized placement of web applications utilizing minimal data transfer.</t>
