      <t>Dyncast support in a network provides a client with a fresh optimal path to a service provider instance, where optimality includes both path and service provider characteristics. As a service invocation usually takes more than one packet, dyncast needs to provide instance affinity for each service invocation. Naive implementations of instance affinity require per-application, per service-invocation state in the network. The present short document defines a way to provide instance affinity that does not require, but also does not rule out per-application state. It also discusses how the information that an application needs to operate this mechanism can be provided via the discovery mechanisms offered by a CoRE (Constrained RESTful Environments) server, either in "/.well-known/core" or via the CoRE resource directory.</t>
