      <t>Content Distribution Applications (e.g., P2P applications) are widely used on the Internet and make up a large portion of the traffic in many networks. One technique to improve the network efficiency of these applications is to introduce storage capabilities within the networks; this is the capability to be provided by a DECADE (DECoupled Application Data Enroute) compliant system. This document presents an architecture for DECADE, discusses the underlying principles, and identifies key functionalities required for introducing in-network storage for these applications. In addition, some examples are given to illustrate these concepts in an informative manner.</t>
