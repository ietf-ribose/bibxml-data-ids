      <t>This document is intended to serve as input to the discussion in the Mobile IP Working Group regarding securing MIPv6 Binding Updates. This document tries to capture a possible extreme point in the design space for a solution to that problem, for the purposes of exploring the design space. The author does not claim that this protocol is better than any other proposed solutions - merely that it is different and the differences can help in understanding design tradeoffs in this space.</t>
