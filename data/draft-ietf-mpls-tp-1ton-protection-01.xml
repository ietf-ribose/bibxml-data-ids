      <t>As part of the Transport Profile for Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TP) there is a requirement to support 1:n linear protection for transport paths. This requirement is further elaborated in RFC6372 [SurvivFwk]. The basic protocol for linear protection, specified in RFC6378 [LinProt], is limited to 1+1 and 1:1 protection. This document extends that protocol to address the additional functionality necessary to support scenarios where a single protection path is preconfigured to provide protection of multiple transport paths between two joint endpoints. This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.</t>
