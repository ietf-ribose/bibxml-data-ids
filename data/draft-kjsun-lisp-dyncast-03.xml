      <t>When a service has been distributed over many locations in the network, providing service by utilizing computing resources hosted in various servers is required to consider supporting delay-sensitive service and optimizing network loads. For that reason, Computing- Aware Networking (CAN) is a new routing approach to balance services using service-specific metrics instead of simply dispatching the service request in a static way or optimizing solely connectivity metrics [draft-liu-can-ps-usecases]. Currently, CAN solutions are discussed with both existing technologies (e.g., DNS, L7 Load Balancer, etc.) and a new approach. In this document, it describes the LISP-based CAN approach and related standard works to meet requirements.</t>
