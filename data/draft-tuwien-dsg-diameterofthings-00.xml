    <abstract>
      <t>The Diameter of Things (DoT) protocol is intended to provide a realtime telemetry framework for IoT applications in resource-constraint gateways. Such metering capability is needed when lack of resources among competing applications dictates our schedule and credit allocation. The DoT protocol can be incorporated to implement real-time AAA of IoT services for prepaid subscribers. The DoT employs mechanisms to meter the IoT composite application units used/charged over a client credit. Such metering methods come in two models of session-based and event-based patterns. The former is used for scenarios where the charged units are continuously consumed while the latter is typically used when units are implicit invocation events.</t>
