      <t>This memo specifies modifications required to DS-Lite so that both IPv4/ IPv6 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4/ IPv6 servers. The DS-Lite solution is based on DS-Lite Basic Bridging BroadBand element (B4) proxying IGMP and then tunneling IGMP messages to DS- Lite Address Family Transition Router element (AFTR). IPv4 multicast data received at AFTR is tunneled to B$ and then delivered to the hosts. IPv6 multicast and MLD can be supported in a similar way.</t>
