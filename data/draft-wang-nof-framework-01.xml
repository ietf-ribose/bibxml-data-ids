    <abstract>
      <t>NVMe over Fabrics defines a common architecture that supports a range of storage networking fabrics for NVMe block storage protocol over a storage networking fabric, such as Ethernet, Fibre Channel and InfiniBand. For IP-based network, RDMA or TCP technology can be used to transport NVMe commands. When a network fault occurs, NVMe connections need to be switched over. Currently, no effective method is available for quick detection, switchover is performed only based on KA timeout, resulting in low performance. This document defines the basic framework of how network-assisted hosts and storage devices can quickly detect NVMe connection failures caused by network faults for NVMe IP-based SANs.</t>
