      <t>This document considers the applicability of ACTN to Packet Optical Integration (POI) and IP and Optical DWDM domain internetworking, and specifically the YANG models being defined by the IETF to support this deployment architecture. In this document we highlight the IETF protocols and data models that may be used for the ACTN and control of POI networks, with particular focus on the interfaces between the MDSC (Multi-Domain Service Coordinator) and the underlying Packet and Optical Domain Controllers (P-PNC and O-PNC) to support Packet Optical Integration (POI) use cases.</t>
