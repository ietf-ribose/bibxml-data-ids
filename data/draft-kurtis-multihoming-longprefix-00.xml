      <t>In the current IP version 4 Internet, many organizations that are not Internet Service Providers are still getting their Internet connectivity through multiple providers by having address space that are announced via multiple paths. This is commonly referred to as multihoming. For the IP version 6 Internet, there have long been a debate as to how to achieve the same effect.
