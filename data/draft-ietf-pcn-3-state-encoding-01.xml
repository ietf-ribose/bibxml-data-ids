      <t>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a mechanism designed to protectthe Quality of Service of inelastic flows within a controlled domain.It does this by marking packets when traffic load on a link isapproaching or has exceeded a threshold below the physical link rate.This experimental encoding scheme specifies how three encoding statescan be carried in the IP header using a combination of two DSCPs andthe ECN bits. The Basic scheme only allows for three encodingstates. The Full scheme provides 6 states, enough for limited end-to-end support for ECN as well.</t>
