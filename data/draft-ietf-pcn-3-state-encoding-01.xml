    <abstract>
      <t>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a mechanism designed to protect the Quality of Service of inelastic flows within a controlled domain. It does this by marking packets when traffic load on a link is approaching or has exceeded a threshold below the physical link rate. This experimental encoding scheme specifies how three encoding states can be carried in the IP header using a combination of two DSCPs and the ECN bits. The Basic scheme only allows for three encoding states. The Full scheme provides 6 states, enough for limited end- to-end support for ECN as well.</t>
