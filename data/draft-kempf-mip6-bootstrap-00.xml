      <t>This document discusses the creation of a security association between a mobile node and a home agent that is previously unknown to it. This problem is called the bootstrapping problem. The document discusses several different usage scenarios, as well as related issues involving informing the mobile node of changes in the home network topology and mobility management service. Limitations of the base Mobile IPv6 protocol in dealing with the scenarios are outlined.</t>
