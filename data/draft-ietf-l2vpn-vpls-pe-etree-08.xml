    <abstract>
      <t>A generic Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) solution which uses VLANs to indicate root or leaf traffic is specified for Ethernet- Tree (E-Tree) services. A VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model is illustrated as an example for the solution. In the solution, E-Tree VPLS PEs are interconnected by PWs which carry the VLAN indicating the E-Tree attribute, the MAC address based Ethernet forwarding engine and the PW work in the same way as in RFC 4762 and RFC 4448 respectively. A signaling mechanism is further described for E-Tree capability and VLAN mapping negotiation.</t>
