      <t>This draft proposes a framework for path quality verification over an all-optical network. Because it will be difficult to ensure quality of a dynamically established path over an all-optical network, it may be useful for network providers to have means to verify quality of a path before it is served to the subscribers. This draft proposes a framework for such means, including requirements behind them and a path continuity check mechanism to verify optical-level path quality upon a path's establishment by the GMPLS signaling.</t>
