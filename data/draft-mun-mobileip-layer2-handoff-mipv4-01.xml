      <t>Mobile-IPv4 describes how a Mobile Node can perform layer 3 handoff between subnets served by different Foreign Agents. Sometimes the delay during handoffs can exceed the threshold of delay sensitive applications. So low delay must be considered.This document describes a method to perform fast handoff on the Layer 2 for Mobile-IPv4 with 802.11's Access Point. Mobile-IPv4 Registration messages are carried in the Information Elements of 802.11 frames. According to this method, Mobile-IPv4 can perform handoff at the same time as 802.11 handoff.But some modifications bust be adopted in the existing Mobile-IPv4 and802.11's entities such as Mobile Node and Access Point.</t>
