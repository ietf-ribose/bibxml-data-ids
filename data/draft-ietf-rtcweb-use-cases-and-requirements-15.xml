    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes web based real-time communication use-cases. Requirements on the browser functionality are derived from the use- cases. This document was developed in an initial phase of the work with rather minor updates at later stages. It has not really served as a tool in deciding features or scope for the WGs efforts so far. It is being published to record the early conclusions of the working group. It will not be used as a set of rigid guidelines that specifications and implementations will be held to in the future.</t>
