      <t>This document describes how personal contact information may be exchanged in a structured format suitable for machine processing. The SGML-based Personal Contact Information (SPCI) format can be used to encode personal information of the type which might be found on a business card, in a form which is also suitable for human interpretation. Possible uses of this format include: exchange of personal information in email messages; encoding author information within a document; providing information about a mailing list; as an exchange format for 'address book' databases; and providing contact information for a company. The SPCI information is encoded using SGML, and the specification is aligned with the SHAVE rules. A MIME body part type is defined for SPCI information.</t>
