      <t>This specification defines methods to determine Kerberos realm descriptive information for services that are known by their DNS name. Currently, finding such information is done through static mappings or educated guessing. DNS can make this process more dynamic, provided that DNSSEC is used to ensure authenticity of resource records.</t>
