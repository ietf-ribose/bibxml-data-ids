      <t>This glossary is intended to help with the understanding of terms used in the Ivip core-edge separation architecture and of some non- Ivip terms which are pertinent to scalable routing. These are not "official" definitions of terms as used in scalable routing, but I hope they will help newcomers to the field. Please suggest corrections, additions and improvements.</t>
