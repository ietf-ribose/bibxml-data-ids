      <t>This glossary is intended to help with the understanding of termsused in the Ivip core-edge separation architecture and of some non-Ivip terms which are pertinent to scalable routing. These are not"official" definitions of terms as used in scalable routing, but Ihope they will help newcomers to the field. Please suggestcorrections, additions and improvements.</t>
