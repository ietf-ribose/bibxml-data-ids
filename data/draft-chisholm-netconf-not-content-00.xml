      <t>The NETCONF Event Notifications standard specifies the mechanism by which NETCONF clients can subscribe to and receive event notifications. However, with the exception of a timestamp, no standard Notification content was defined. This memo defines a set of information that should be included in all NETCONF notifications, information that should be included based on class of notification and also defines a set of specific notifications to support specific management functions, such as configuration.</t>
