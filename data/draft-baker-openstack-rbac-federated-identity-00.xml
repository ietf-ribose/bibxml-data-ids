      <t>This note describes an IPv6 option intended to carry a Federated Identity for use in Role-Based Access Control. Rather than identify a person, it identifies a group of systems that the sender is a member of. Role-Based Access Control permits specified sets of systems to communicate with other specified sets of systems, with the intention of scalability.</t>
