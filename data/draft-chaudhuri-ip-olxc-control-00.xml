      <t>This document details requirements and mechanisms for opticalbandwidth management and restoration in a dynamically reconfigurableoptical network. A management approach is described where IPalgorithms and mechanisms are used to control optical resources,paving the way for the optical Internet. The proposal isspecifically intended for optical internetworking in which IProuters are connected by the reconfigurable optical layer usinglightpaths. However, it is assumed that the same methodology willbe used for non-IP traffic as well.</t>
