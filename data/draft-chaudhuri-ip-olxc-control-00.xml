      <t>This document details requirements and mechanisms for optical bandwidth management and restoration in a dynamically reconfigurable optical network. A management approach is described where IP algorithms and mechanisms are used to control optical resources, paving the way for the optical Internet. The proposal is specifically intended for optical internetworking in which IP routers are connected by the reconfigurable optical layer using lightpaths. However, it is assumed that the same methodology will be used for non-IP traffic as well.</t>
