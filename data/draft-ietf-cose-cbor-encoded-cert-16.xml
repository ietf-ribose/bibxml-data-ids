    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a CBOR encoding of X.509 certificates. The resulting certificates are called C509 certificates. The CBOR encoding supports a large subset of RFC 5280, common certificate profiles and is extensible. Two types of C509 certificates are defined. One type is an invertible CBOR re-encoding of DER encoded X.509 certificates with the signature field copied from the DER encoding. The other type is identical except that the signature is over the CBOR encoding instead of the DER encoding, avoiding the use of ASN.1. Both types of certificates have the same semantics as X.509 and the same reduced size compared to X.509. The document also specifies CBOR encoded data structures for certificate (signing) requests and certificate request templates, new COSE headers, as well as a TLS certificate type and a file format for C509. This document updates RFC 6698; the TLSA selectors registry is extended to include C509 certificates.</t>
