    <abstract>
      <t>NFV relocates network functions from dedicated hardware appliances to generic servers, so they can run in software. However, incomplete or inconsistent configuration of virtualized network functions (VNF) and forwarding graph (FG, aka service chain) could cause break-down of the supporting infrastructure. In this sense, verification is essential for network operators to check their requirements and network properties are correctly enforced in the supporting infrastructures. Recognizing these problems, we discuss key properties to be checked. Also, we present architectural framework and challenging issues for verification in NFV environments.</t>
