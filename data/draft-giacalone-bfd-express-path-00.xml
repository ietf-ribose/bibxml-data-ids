      <t>In certain networks, such as, but not limited to, financialinformation networks (e.g. stock market data providers), networkperformance criteria (e.g. latency) have become (or are becoming) as(or more) critical to data path selection than other metrics.This document describes extensions to the BFD protocol, such thatnetwork performance information can be gathered in a scalablefashion, and subsequently used (by other protocols) to make pathselection decisions. These extensions will also provide granularperformance monitoring information.</t>
