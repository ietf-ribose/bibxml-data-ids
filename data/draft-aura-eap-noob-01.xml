      <t>Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for multiple authentication methods. This document defines the EAP-NOOB authentication method for nimble out-of-band (OOB) authentication and key derivation. This EAP method is intended for bootstrapping all kinds of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that have a minimal user interface and no pre-configured authentication credentials. The method makes use of a user-assisted one-directional OOB channel between the peer device and authentication server.</t>
