      <t>This document discusses mechanisms that a downstream Autonomous System (AS) can use, when it detects a potential Distributed Denial- of-Service (DDoS) attack, to request an upstream AS to perform inbound filtering in its ingress routers for traffic that the downstream AS wishes to drop. The upstream AS can then undertake appropriate actions (including, blackhole, drop, rate-limit, or add to watch list) on the suspect traffic to the downstream AS thus reducing the effectiveness of the attack.</t>
