      <t>Several papers in the May 2008 P2PI workshop have argued that thereis a need to build new protocol mechanisms to accommodate peer-to-peer traffic in networks in the most efficient way and with minimalimpact to other traffic. This paper presents an analysis of suchsolutions from the point of view of the incentives of the differentparties involved in peer-to-peer traffic. The paper concludes thatit is essential to understand the incentives in order to have adeployable solution.</t>
