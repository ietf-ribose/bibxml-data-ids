      <t>This document defines Address Settlement by Peer-to-Peer (ASP), apeer-to-peer (P2P) binary signaling protocol for usage on theInternet. A P2P signaling protocol provides its clients with anabstract hash table service between a set of cooperating peers thatform the P2P network. ASP is designed to support a P2P SessionInitiation Protocol (SIP) network, but it can be utilized by otherapplications with similar requirements. ASP introduces the notion ofusages, which are a collection of data types that are required for aparticular application. For SIP, these types include location, STUNand TURN servers. ASP defines a security model based on acertificate enrollment service that provides peers with uniqueidentities. ASP also provides protocol extensibility and defines amigration methodology, allowing for major upgrades of the P2P networkwithout service disruption.</t>
