      <t>This document describes hierarchically structured binary encoding format called Ruoska Encoding (later RSK). The main design goals are minimal resource usage, well defined structure with good selection of widely known data types, and still extendable for future usage. The main benefit when compared to non binary hierarchically structured formats like XML is simplicity and minimal resource demands. Even basic XML parsing is time and memory consuming operation. When compared to other binary formats like BER encoding of ASN.1 the main benefit is simplicity. ASN.1 with many different encodings is complex and even simple implementation needs a lot of effort. RSK is also more efficient than BER.</t>
