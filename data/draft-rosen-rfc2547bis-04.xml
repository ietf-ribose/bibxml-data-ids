      <t>This document describes a method by which a Service Provider may usean IP backbone to provide VPNs for its customers. MPLS is used forforwarding packets over the backbone, and BGP is used fordistributing routes over the backbone. The primary goal of thismethod is to support the case in which a client obtains IP backboneservices from a Service Provider or Service Providers with which itmaintains contractual relationships. The client may be anenterprise, a group of enterprises which need an extranet, anInternet Service Provider, an application service provider, anotherVPN Service Provider which uses this same method to offer VPNs toclients of its own, etc. The method makes it very simple for theclient to use the backbone services. It is also very scalable andflexible for the Service Provider, and allows the Service Provider toadd value.</t>
