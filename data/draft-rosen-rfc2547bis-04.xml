      <t>This document describes a method by which a Service Provider may use an IP backbone to provide VPNs for its customers. MPLS is used for forwarding packets over the backbone, and BGP is used for distributing routes over the backbone. The primary goal of this method is to support the case in which a client obtains IP backbone services from a Service Provider or Service Providers with which it maintains contractual relationships. The client may be an enterprise, a group of enterprises which need an extranet, an Internet Service Provider, an application service provider, another VPN Service Provider which uses this same method to offer VPNs to clients of its own, etc. The method makes it very simple for the client to use the backbone services. It is also very scalable and flexible for the Service Provider, and allows the Service Provider to add value.</t>
