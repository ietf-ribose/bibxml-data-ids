      <t>Domain Name System Resource Records are identified in part by their class. The class field is not effective, and it is not used the way it appears to have been intended. This memo suspends additions to the DNS class registry pending greater clarity on how classes might be used, and until such clarification requires those defining new RRTYPEs to define them for all classes.</t>
