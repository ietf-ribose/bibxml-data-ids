    <abstract>
      <t>The Reliable Multicast Transport (RMT) Working Group has been chartered to standardize reliable multicast transport services and protocol instantiations, which include the tree-based ACK (TRACK) protocol. This document is concerned with defining the building block for auto-configuration of the logical ACK-tree. According to the charter, a building block is 'a coarse-grained modular component that is common to multiple protocols along with abstract APIs that define a building block's access methods and their arguments.' The TRACK BB mechanisms [5] will operate on the logical ACK-tree that is configured by this TREE BB in the TRACK PI sessions. This document is made based on the guidelines for the RMT BB [2] and the recommendations for TREE BB [4].</t>
