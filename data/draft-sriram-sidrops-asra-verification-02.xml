    <abstract>
      <t>Autonomous System Provider Authorization (ASPA) record authorizes provider ASes of a customer AS (CAS). While ASPA-based AS_PATH verification can correctly detect and mitigate route leaks and some forged-origin or forged-path-segment hijacks, it fails to detect some malicious path manipulations for routes that are received from transit providers. This document utilizes a new RPKI object called Autonomous System Relationship Authorization (ASRA) that significantly enhances AS_PATH verification complementing ASPA. ASRA fills in a significant gap in the ASPA method by adding the capability to detect fake links in the AS_PATHs in BGP Updates propagated from providers to customers. ASRA achieves this by allowing an AS to register additional AS relationships, i.e., customers and lateral peers.</t>
