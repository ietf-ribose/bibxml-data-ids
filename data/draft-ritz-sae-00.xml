      <t>This document specifies the Static Artifact Exchange (SAE) protocol, an asynchronous protocol for exchanging cryptographic artifacts between two parties via a shared, stateless repository. SAE uses a pull-only communication model where peers poll for the presence of immutable, pre-computed artifacts to coordinate a sequenced exchange. By design, this static artifact model avoids dynamic request processing, reducing common attack surfaces like injection and parser vulnerabilities. The protocol is transport-agnostic, allowing each party to access the repository using different underlying mechanisms (e.g., cloud APIs or standard HTTPS). SAE is intended as a foundational transport pattern for protocols like Ephemeral Compute Attestation (ECA), which require a secure, minimal channel where trust is derived from the cryptographic content of the artifacts, not from the channel itself.</t>
