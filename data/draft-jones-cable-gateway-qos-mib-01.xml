      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP- based management for prioritized Quality of Service functionality within a LAN, between a CableHome residential gateway device and CableHome compliant LAN host devices. This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7]. The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards.</t>
