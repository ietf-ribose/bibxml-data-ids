    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines MSIX, a protocol that enables transmission of service definitions and service usage information from client to server. Services can be defined dynamically such that a metering server can become capable of handling new metered service types during the normal course of business without need for recompilation or reconfiguration. Service usage description semantics support transactional data submission. Support for both simple and compound transactions is provided.</t>
