      <t>Telephony Routing over IP (TRIP) [2] provides a means for entities in a VoIP network to advertise telephony routes to their peers. No assumption can be made about the treatment which is offered by an endpoint propagating a route - it could intend to terminate the call in some fashion or apply services to the call. This document proposes an optional ServiceCode attribute propagated along with such routes which provides more information about the services offered by the originator.</t>
