      <t>Traffic engineering using MPLS involves the setting up of labelswitched paths (LSP) possibly with explicit routing and withbandwidth guarantees (for label switched paths). The reliability ofthese LSPs can be increased by providing a backup LSP onto whichtraffic can be switched upon failure of an element in the path of theactive LSP. Backup LSPs can be routed in a way that bandwidth can beshared between backup links of more than one active path while stillguaranteeing recoverability for a set of failures. This sharing greatlyincreases the network efficiency thereby increasing the number of LSPsthat can be carried while maintaining guarantees. Algorithms which canroute such recoverable LSPs while using only aggregate network usage information are being developed. To route the active LSP and the(possibly shared) backup LSP, the topology information of the networkis needed and this can be provided by a link state routing protocollike IS-IS. This document describes the encoding of the additionalinformation within the link state protocol data unit (LSPdu) of IS-ISto enable routing of shared backup paths.</t>
