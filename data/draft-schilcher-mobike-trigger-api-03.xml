      <t>MOBIKE is a protocol which adds mobility and multihome support forIKEv2. MOBIKE peers continuously exchange a list of available IPaddresses each other. A MOBIKE peer should have some informationabout the status of each address and interface in order to executethe respective actions. Examples may comprise switching from oneaddress or interface to another. This information, which will bereferred as trigger, is distributed over a number of protocol daemonsat an end host. To make this information available to a MOBIKEdaemon, it is necessary to store it centrally at the host (calledtrigger database) and to enable the protocols to insert the triggersand to allow MOBIKE to obtain timely information.</t>
