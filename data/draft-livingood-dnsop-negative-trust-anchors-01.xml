      <t>DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is now entering widespread deployment. However, domain signing tools and processes are not yet as mature and reliable as those for non-DNSSEC-related domain administration tools and processes. Negative Trust Anchors (described in this document) can be used to mitigate DNSSEC validation failures.
