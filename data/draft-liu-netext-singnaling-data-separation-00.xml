    <abstract>
      <t>The mobility management signaling of PMIPv6 includes PBU/PBA message.Both messages use the IPv6 mobility header, which is an expansion ofIPv6 header, to carry signaling information. The transport protocolhas not been used, which can not guarantee the reliability oftransmission. This draft proposes to extend PMIP to make it hastransport protocol support and negotiation mechanism. The advantageof this extension is that transport protocol can provide morereliable transportation especially in the scenario that MAG and LMAare connected by a congested IP network.</t>
