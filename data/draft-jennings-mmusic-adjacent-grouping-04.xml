      <t>Applications such as multi-screen video conferencing systems or advertisement boards often have multiple audio and video streams that are organized to be rendered side by side or in a grid. This specification uses the RFC 5888 Grouping Framework to define new semantics for grouping the media streams to be rendered side by side or in a grid and indicating their relative ordering.</t>
