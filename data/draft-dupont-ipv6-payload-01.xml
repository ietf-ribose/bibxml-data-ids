      <t>This draft describes a method by which many IPv6 payload data bodies may be encapsulated in a single IPv6 datagram using a new non-terminal header will contain both a payload and necessary fields (like a ``next header'' field) allowing header chaining. This document specifies how two packets can be merged into a single one and the reverse one-step operation. But the main purpose is to provide a basis to discussions about the pros and cons of such a mechanism.</t>
