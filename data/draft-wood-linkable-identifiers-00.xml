      <t>Rotating public identifiers is encouraged as best practice as a means of protecting endpoint privacy. For example, regular MAC address randomization helps mitigate device tracking across time and space. Other protocols beyond those in the link layer also have public identifiers or parameters that should rotate over time, in unison with coupled protocol identifiers, and perhaps with application level identifiers. This document surveys such privacy-related identifiers exposed by common Internet protocols at various layers in a network stack. It provides advice for rotating linked identifiers such that privacy violations do not occur from rotating one identifier while neglecting to rotate coupled identifiers.</t>
