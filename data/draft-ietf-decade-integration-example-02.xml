      <t>DECADE is an in-network storage infrastructure which is under discussions and constructions. It can be integrated into Peer-to- Peer (P2P) applications to achieve more efficient content distributions. This document represents two detailed examples of how to integrate DECADE into P2P applications (live streaming and file sharing). Specifically, it describes mainly about: 1) a preliminary DECADE client API; 2) a P2P live streaming integration with DECADE; 3) a P2P file sharing integration with DECADE; 4)ALTO+DECADE based file distribution platform; 5) tests on our DECADE integrarions and 6) an application performance analysis from the tests.</t>
