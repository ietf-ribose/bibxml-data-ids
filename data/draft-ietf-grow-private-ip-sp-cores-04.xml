      <t>The purpose of this document is to provide a discussion of the potential problems of using private, RFC1918, or non-globally- routable addressing within the core of an SP network. The discussion focuses on link addresses and to a small extent loopback addresses. While many of the issues are well recognised within the ISP community, there appears to be no document that collectively describes the issues.</t>
