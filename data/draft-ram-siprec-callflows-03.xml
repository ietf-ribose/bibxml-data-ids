      <t>Session recording is a critical requirement in many communications environments such as call centers and financial trading. In some of these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory, compliance, and consumer protection reasons. Recording of a session is typically performed by sending a copy of a media stream to a recording device. This document lists call flows that has snapshot of metadata sent from SRC to SRS, the metadata format for which is described in [I-D.ietf-siprec-metadata] . This is purely an informational document that is written to support the model defined in the metadata draft.</t>
