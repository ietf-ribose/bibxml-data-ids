      <t>Despite many years of effort, simple username-password authenticationis still prevalent. In many cases a password is the only credentialavailable to the end user. IKEv2 uses EAP as a sub-protocol for userauthentication. This provides a well-specified and extensiblearchitecture. To this day EAP does not provide a simple password-based authentication method. The only existing passwordauthentication methods either require the peer to know the passwordin advance (EAP-MD5), or are needlessly complex when used withinIKEv2 (e.g. PEAP). This document codifies the common practice ofusing EAP-GTC for this type of authentication, with the goal ofachieving maximum interoperability. The various security issues areextensively analyzed.</t>
