      <t>Our combined draft on fast-reroute, draft-ping-rsvp-fastreroute- 00.txt, leaves several areas with future work required. One of those areas is the merging rules for detour LSPs. This draft describes some of the issues with the merging rules presented in draft-ping- rsvp-fastreroute-02.txt and proposes a solution which also enhances interoperability.</t>
