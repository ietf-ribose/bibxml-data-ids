    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes Fast Route Attestation (FRA), a mechanism for securing AS paths and preventing prefix hijacking by signing and verifying critical AS path segments (i.e., adjacent AS triples along AS path). When full-deployed, FRA can achieve similar level of security as BGPSec, but with much higher efficiency. When partial- deployed, FRA offers more security benefits than BGPSec.</t>
