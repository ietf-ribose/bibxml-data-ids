      <t>When calculating the path selection for service traffic, it is important to consider not only network metrics, but also the impact of service Metric. Therefore, it is necessary to transmit service Metric information from the service site to the user access site, in order to facilitate path selection for service traffic at the access router. This document describes an approach for using the BGP Control Plane to steer traffic based on a set of metrics that reflect the underlying network conditions and other service-specific state collected from available service locations.</t>
