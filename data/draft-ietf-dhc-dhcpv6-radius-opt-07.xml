      <t>The DHCPv6 RADIUS option provides a mechanism to exchange authorization and identification information between the DHCPv6 relay agent and the DHCPv6 server. This mechanism is meant for the centralized DHCPv6 server to select the right configuration for the requesting DHCPv6 client based on the authorization information received from the RADIUS server, which is not co-located with the DHCPv6 server. The Network Access Server (NAS) acts as DHCPv6 relay agent and RADIUS client simultaneously in this document.</t>
