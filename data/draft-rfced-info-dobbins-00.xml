      <t>The Address Resolution and Location Discovery (ARLD) protocol is part of the InterSwitch Message Protocol (ISMP). ISMP was designed to facilitate interswitch communication within distributed connection-oriented switching networks. The ARLD protocol is used to resolve a packet destination address when the source and destination pair of a packet does not match a known connection. It is also used to provide end-station address mobility between switches.</t>
