      <t>Many of the routing protocols today can support multiple topologies or multiple instances [ISISMT] [OSPFV3] [OSPFMT]. In such an environment, prefix, address family, and topology/instance together define an FEC. But the current LDP specificaiton is not sufficient to allow multi-topology/multi-instance to share the same LDP session. In this document we introduce a concept of 'Label Binding Instance' to LDP so that FECs can be unambiguiously identified in a multi- topology/multi-instance routing environment.</t>
