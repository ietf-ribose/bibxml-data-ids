      <t>The document details use cases to mitigate DDoS attacks. These use cases are expected to illustrates involved communications to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks. It is expected that these communications will be in the future handled by the DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS). These scenarios are intended to be useful to derive requirements for the design of DDoS Open threat Signaling.</t>
