      <t>The IPv6 neighbor discovery cache is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack that purposely exhausts the state used during the neighbor discovery address resolution process. This attack can be very disruptive when the target is a router. This memo proposes a stateless form of neighbor discovery to be used by routers to mitigate this attack. It does not require any changes to hosts.</t>
