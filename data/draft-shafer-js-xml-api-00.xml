      <t>JUNOScript is an XML-based API for managing devices. It allows access to both operational and configuration data using a simple RPC mechanism. Sessions can be established using a variety of connection-oriented access methods. This document describes the framing protocol, message content, and capabilities of this API. Design decisions and motivations are also discussed. No attempt is made to formally define a protocol, but rather to document the capabilities of JUNOScript as part of the discussion of XML-based network management.</t>
