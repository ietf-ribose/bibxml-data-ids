      <t>ISO/IEC 10646 defines a multi-octet character set called the Universal Character Set (UCS) which encompasses most of the world's writing systems. Multi-octet characters, however, are not compatible with many current applications and protocols, and this has led to the development of a few so-called UCS transformation formats (UTF), each with different characteristics. UTF-9, the object of this memo, has the characteristic of preserving the full ISO-Latin1 range, providing compatibility with file systems, parsers and other software that rely on ISO-Latin1 values. ISO-Latin1 is almost as widespread as ASCII in many countries, especially in most of western Europe, and is the default character set for HTML. A compatible encoding seems desirable, where possible.</t>
