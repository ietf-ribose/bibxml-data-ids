      <t>Telepresence systems create a "being there" conferencing experience. A number of issues need to be solved largely by manipulating multiple audio and video streams. Different systems take different approaches, employ different techniques, and convey information by using different vocabularies, making interoperability extremely challenging. This problem statement describes the typical issues that must be solved and uses examples to illustrate the kind of diversity that makes interworking problematic.</t>
