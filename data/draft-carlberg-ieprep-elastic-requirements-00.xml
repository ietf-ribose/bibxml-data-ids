      <t>The objective of this draft is to present a set of requirements to address requests by users of authorized emergency communications for better than best effort service for elastic service. We stress the word 'request' versus guarantee, and we do NOT advocate broad sweeping changes to elastic applications. This document provides background information on emergency communications and presents suggested do's and don'ts in addressing the issue of requirements for elastic services. Finally, examples of requirements for specific applications are presented.</t>
