      <t>The IDN Working Group is working on proposals for internationalized domain names that might become a standard in the IETF. Before a single full proposal can be made, competing proposals must be compared on a wide range of requirements and desired features. This document compares the many parts of a comprehensive protocol that have been proposed. It is the companion document to 'Requirements of Internationalized Domain Names' [IDN-REQ], which lays out the requirements for the internationalized domain name protocol.</t>
