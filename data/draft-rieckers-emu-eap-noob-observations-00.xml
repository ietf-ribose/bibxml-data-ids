      <t>This memo is a random list of things the author noticed about EAP- NOOB when looking at the draft and running the implementation while capturing the packets (https://github.com/Vogeltak/hostap). Most of the statements were written down before the author started the implementation. By the time of writing this draft, a mostly complete server implementation has been written. The implementation- specific remarks are mostly thoughts the author had while planning their own implementation.</t>
