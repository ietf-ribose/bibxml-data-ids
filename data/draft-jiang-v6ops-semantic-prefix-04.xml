      <t>This informational document discusses the use of embedded semantics within IPv6 address schemas. Network operators who have large IPv6 address space may choose to embed some semantics into their IPv6 addressing by assigning additional significance to specific bits within the prefix. By embedding semantics into IPv6 prefixes, the semantics of packets can be easily inspected. This can simplify the packet differentiation process. However, semantic embedded IPv6 address schemas have their own operational cost and even potential pitfalls. Some complex semantic embedded IPv6 address schemas may also require new technologies in addition to existing Internet protocols. The document aims to understand the usage of semantic embedded IPv6 address schemas, and neutrally analyze on the associated advantages, drawbacks and technical gaps for more complex address schemas.</t>
