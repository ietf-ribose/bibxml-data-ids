      <t>This draft requests development of detailed specifications for the technical and operational requirements for an Internet-based International Emergency Preparedness Scheme (IEPS) as defined by ITU-T Recommendation E.106. Public telecommunications services have long had such a scheme, to ensure priority handling of telephone communications, such as during natural disasters. As a wide range of communication services increasingly rely upon the family of specifications related to Internet Protocol (IP), IETF work needs to include consideration and provision for supporting IEPS. This work needs to be addressed in two phases concurrently - 1) interface for transition from today's public switched telephone network (PSTN) to IP-based network telephony services, and 2) additional and enhanced capabilities, such as application-specific IEPS services. An Email list for discussion and a Web site for background and documents has been established to assist the work</t>
