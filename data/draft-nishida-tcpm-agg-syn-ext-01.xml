      <t>TCP option space is scarce resource as its max length is limited to 40 bytes. This limitation becomes more significant in SYN segments as all options used in a connection should be exchanged during SYN negotiations. This document proposes a new SYN option negotiation scheme that can aggregate multiple TCP options in SYN segments into a single option so that more options can be negotiate during 3 way handshake. With its simple design, the approach does not require fundamental changes in TCP.</t>
