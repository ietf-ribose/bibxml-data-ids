      <t>This document defines a simple protocol for interaction between the PSTN and applications in the IP domain. It is not intended to be a full INAP or JAIN like interface, rather to easily enable some of the more common interactions in a way that will allow application developers, with minimal telephony knowledge, to quickly integrate it into new and existing applications. This document includes simple Java HTTP Servlets which implement some basic parts of the protocol as an example (note similar approaches would work for CGI also). To get a quick feel for the protocol go straight to the example section near the end</t>
