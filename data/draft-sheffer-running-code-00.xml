      <t>This document proposes a simple-to-implement solution to the problem of rewarding Internet protocols that have been implemented over those that have not. Rather than establishing an explicit process, we allow authors to publicize their implementation, which should enable working groups to treat relevant drafts preferentially. This solution is suggested for consideration as a process experiment.</t>
