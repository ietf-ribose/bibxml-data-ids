      <t>We study the performance of the Constant Bit Rate (CBR) and the interpolated ON-OFF voice over the differentiated services Internet. Both the Premium and Assured services are tested, and their relative performance is investigated. Using these services, at the DS3 rate, the call handling capacity can be doubled, at the expense of packetization delay and a few milliseconds packet delay. Also, at a reasonable load level, if the Assured flows are smooth their playout delay could be limited to a few milliseconds. This is true even in the presence of the higher-priority Premium flows. The loss rate of the Assured packets at the RIO buffer is observed to be within the order of 10^(-06), where as the best effort packet loss rate is within the order of 10^(-02). Finally, shaping the Premium traffic reaches diminishing returns; shaping could often exceedingly increase the end-to-end delay and jitter of the Premium traffic.
