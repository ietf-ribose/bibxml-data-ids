      <t>Link-local IP connectivity allows hosts on the same network to communicate with each other without the need for centralized IP addressing infrastructure. The IP prefixes 169.254.0.0/16 and fe80::/10 were reserved for this purpose. However, both IP versions have limitations that make link-local addresses unideal for usage with URI-based protocols. This document provides guidance for how best to enable link-local connectivity in such protocols. This document also obsoletes RFC 6874, a previous attempt at solving this issue.</t>
