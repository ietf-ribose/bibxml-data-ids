      <t>In the networks where IPv6 tunneling is used, it is not specific about how a tunnel end-node identifies the received tunnel packets by checking the destination and source addresses. when the tunnel end- node is configured with multiple IPv6 addresses or multiple IPv6 tunnel instances, such identification is necessary. This document describes the problem and defines the behavior of IPv6 tunnel end- nodes about identifying tunnel packets.</t>
