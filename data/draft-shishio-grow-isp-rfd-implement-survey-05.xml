      <t>BGP Route Flap Damping [RFC2439] is a mechanism that targets route stability. It penalyzes routes that flap with the aim of reducing CPU load on the routers. But it has side-effects. Thus, in 2006, RIPE recommended not to use Route Flap Damping (see [RIPE-378]). Now, some researchers propose to turn RFD, with less aggressive parameters, back on [draft-ymbk-rfd-usable]. This document describes results of a survey conducted among service provider on their use of BGP Route Flap Damping.</t>
