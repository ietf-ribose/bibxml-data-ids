    <abstract>
      <t>Servers often rate-limit incoming requests, for example, rate-limit based upon the source IP address to provide equitable service to clients. However, oblivious HTTP removes the ability for the server to distinguish amongst clients so the server can only rate-limit traffic from the oblivious relay. This harms all clients behind that oblivious relay. This specification enables a server to convey rate-limit information to an oblivious relay, which can use it to apply rate-limit policies on clients. Cooperating oblivious relays can thus provide more equitable service to their distinguishable clients without impacting on all clients behind that oblivious relay.</t>
