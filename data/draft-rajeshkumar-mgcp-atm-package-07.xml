      <t>This document describes an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) package for the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP). This package includes new Local Connection Options, ATM-specific events and signals, and ATM connection parameters. Also included is a description of codec and profile negotiation. It extends the MGCP that is currently being deployed in a number of products. Implementers should be aware of developments in the IETF Megaco Working Group and ITU SG16, which are currently working on a potential successor to this protocol.
