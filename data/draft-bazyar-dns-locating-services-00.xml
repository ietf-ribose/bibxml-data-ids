      <t>Internet users continue to find new ways to apply existing Internet standards and technology. In particular, it has become common usage to use the DNS to locate services on a particular network, by use of names like gopher.tc.umn.edu or www.hypermall.com. This was a natural use of DNS. However, the continued commercialization of the Internet and the current trend towards service providers who maintain services and 'pseudo-domains' for numerous customers, and the difficulties of using multiple IP's requires that not only an IP address, but a port number as well, be available to client software looking for a particular service. This draft describes a simple way to support 'multi-home' servers through the DNS, with no changes to existing protocols, and only minimal additions to client software.</t>
