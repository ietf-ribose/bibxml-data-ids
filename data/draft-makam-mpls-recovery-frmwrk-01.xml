      <t>Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) [1] integrates the labelswapping forwarding paradigm with network layer routing. To deliverreliable service, MPLS requires a set of procedures to provideprotection of the traffic carried on different paths. This requiresthat the label switched routers (LSRs) support fault detection,fault notification, and fault recovery mechanisms, and that MPLSsignaling [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] support the configuration of recovery.With these objectives in mind, this document specifies a frameworkfor MPLS based recovery.</t>
