    <abstract>
      <t>WebRTC applications collect ICE candidates as part of the process of creating peer-to-peer connections. To maximize the probability of a direct peer-to-peer connection, the endpoint's local IP addresses are included in this candidate collection. However, these addresses are typically private and, as such, their disclosure has privacy implications. This document describes a privacy-preserving way to share local IP addresses with other endpoints by concealing the addresses with dynamically generated Multicast DNS (mDNS) names.</t>
