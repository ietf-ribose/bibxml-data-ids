    <abstract>
      <t>This document questions the applicability of a multicast semantic for the distributed consensus problem. For this, it details the consensus problem and the solutions taken in current systems. It outlines how point-to-multipoint communication arises as part of the consensus solution. Then, it details a peer-centric realization of a permissionless approach, identifying key issues. These issues include communication costs, performance delays, and lack of finality. Hence, it discusses a multicast strawman and its expected improvements.</t>
