    <abstract>
      <t>Anycast Clusters is a proposal to connect multiple ISP sparse-mode PIM domains together. The environment we anticipate is multiple interconnection points among a set of ISPs when they are unable to colocate their respective RPs at the same dense-mode interconnect point. This is an alternative to the Multi-Level RP design and requires less new code in routers. This proposal is being submitted as a method for the initial phase of Inter-Domain Multicast deployment and is upward compatible with the IDMR protocols being proposed for subsequent phases.</t>
