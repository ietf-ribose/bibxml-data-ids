      <t>This document describes the features and attributes a network quality framework must have to be useful for different stakeholders. The stakeholders included are developers of Applications, End-Users, and Network Operators and Vendors. At a high level, End-Users need an understandable network metric. Application developers need a network metric that allows them to evaluate how well their application is likely to perform given the measured network performance. Network Operators and Vendors need a metric that facilitates troubleshooting and optimization of their networks. Existing network quality metrics and frameworks typically address the needs of one or two of these stakeholders, but we have yet to find one that bridges the needs of all three.</t>
