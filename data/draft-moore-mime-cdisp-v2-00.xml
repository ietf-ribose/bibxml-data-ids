    <abstract>
      <t>This memo provides a mechanism whereby messages conforming to the MIME specifications [RFC 2045, RFC 2046, RFC 2047, RFC 2048, RFC 2049] can convey presentational information. It specifies the 'Content- Disposition' header field, which is optional and valid for any MIME entity ('message' or 'body part'). Two values for this header field are described in this memo; one for the ordinary linear presentation of the body part, and another to facilitate the use of mail to transfer files. Another content-disposition value, for use in HTML file uploads, has been defined in a separate document. [RFC 2388]. It is expected that additional values will be defined in the future, and this memo defines the procedures for extending the set of values. This document is intended as an extension to MIME, which itself is an extension to [RFC 822]. As such, the reader is assumed to be familiar with both the MIME specifications and RFC 822. The information presented herein supplements but does not replace that found in those documents. This document is a revision to the Proposed Standard protocol defined in RFC 2183. As compared to RFC 2183, this document contains minor editorial updates, which are summarized in section 10 of this document.</t>
