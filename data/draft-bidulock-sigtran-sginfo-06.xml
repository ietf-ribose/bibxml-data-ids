      <t>This Internet-Draft describes Signalling Gateway (SG) Information (SGINFO) for Signalling User Adaptation Protocols [M2UA], [M3UA], [SUA], [ISUA], [TUA], which permits supporting Signalling Gateways (SG) to convey additional Application Server (AS) support information to Application Server Processes (ASPs) activating for AS on the SG. This additional AS support information consists of information pertaining to the underlying SS7 Signalling Provider that otherwise would have to be statically configured at the Application Server Process (ASP) or exchanged between SG and ASP using a non-IETF defined protocol.</t>
