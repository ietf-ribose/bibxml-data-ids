      <t>We consider looping issue of a mobile ad hoc network (MANET).Transient routing loops have been observed to form in Ad-hoc Networksrunning the MANET routing protocol with Link Layer Notification(LLN). Even when only a small quantity of the traffic may enterthese loops and only for brief time, the effect is to significantlyincrease the impact on the surrounding network and its traffic thusdegrading end-to-end transmission. The use of MANET routingprotocols with LLN, together with loop detection and discarding oflooping packet to negate the detrimental effects on surroundingtraffic is found to improve performance significantly.</t>
