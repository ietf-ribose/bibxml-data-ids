    <abstract>
      <t>We consider looping issue of a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). Transient routing loops have been observed to form in Ad-hoc Networks running the MANET routing protocol with Link Layer Notification (LLN). Even when only a small quantity of the traffic may enter these loops and only for brief time, the effect is to significantly increase the impact on the surrounding network and its traffic thus degrading end-to-end transmission. The use of MANET routing protocols with LLN, together with loop detection and discarding of looping packet to negate the detrimental effects on surrounding traffic is found to improve performance significantly.</t>
