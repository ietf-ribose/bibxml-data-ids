      <t>Compute First Networking (CFN) Dynamic Anycast refers to in-network edge computing, where a single service offered by a provider has multiple instances attached to multiple edge sites. In this scenario, flows are assigned and consistently forwarded to a specific instance through an anycast approach based on the network status as well as the status of the different instance. This document describes an architecture for the Dynamic Anycast (Dyncast) in Compute First Networking (CFN). It provides an overview, a description of the various components, and a workflow example showing how to provide a balanced multi-edge based service in terms of both computing and networking resources through dynamic anycast in real time.</t>
