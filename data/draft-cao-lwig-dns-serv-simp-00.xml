      <t>This memo discusses a lightweight service simplification method via DNS. Instead of storing the information on the Web infrastructure, the service provider can store them on the DNS servers. By expressing these information in the DNS Resource Records, the requester can get these information directly during the DNS name resolution, without the need of accessing any web resource. This way eliminates the overhead caused by TCP handshake and HTTP get/ response, and can be served as a lightweight information provisioning method.</t>
