      <t>This document defines context replication, an alternative to thecontext initialization procedure found in ROHC (Robust HeaderCompression) [RFC-3095]. Profiles defining support for contextreplication may use the mechanism described herein to establish a newcontext based on another already existing context.Context replication is introduced to reduce the overhead of thecontext establishment procedure, and may be especially useful for thecompression of multiple short-lived flows that may be occurringsimultaneously or near-simultaneously, such as for example short-lived TCP flows.</t>
