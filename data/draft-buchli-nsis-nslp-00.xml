      <t>The Next Steps In Signaling (NSIS) working group within the IETF is currently in the process of defining a signaling protocol. Consensus was reached to split the protocol into two layers; a general-purpose transport layer and a client layer that is application specific. The subject of this document is the specification of a client layer that can be used to request Quality of Service (QoS) to a network.</t>
