    <abstract>
      <t>Neighbor Discovery protocol is currently considered as the best way for providing a default router to a client in IPv6 networks, typically using a Default Router List. Hence it was not considered necessary for DHCPv6 to have this feature. But, recently, some deployment scenarios expressed a need not to use Neighbor Discovery mechanisms. This draft specifies a new DHCPv6 option providing data necessary for a Client's Default Router List (address, lifetime, MAC address) (indirectly, through the Neighbour Cache).</t>
