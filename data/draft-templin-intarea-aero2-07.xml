    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies an Automatic Extended Route Optimization (AERO) service for IP internetworking over Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI) interfaces. AERO/OMNI uses IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) for control plane messaging over the OMNI virtual link. Router discovery and neighbor coordination are employed for network admission and to manage the OMNI link forwarding and routing systems. Secure multilink path selection, multinet traversal, mobility management, multicast forwarding, multihop operation and route optimization are naturally supported through dynamic neighbor cache updates. Both Provider-Aggregated (PA) and Provider-Independent (PI) addressing services are supported. AERO is a widely-applicable service especially well-suited for air/land/sea/space mobility applications including aviation, intelligent transportation systems, mobile end user devices, space exploration and many others.</t>
