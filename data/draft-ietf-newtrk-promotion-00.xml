      <t>Historically, Internet Standards have been characterized by threeprimary criteria: the specifications are stable, implementations ofthem have been demonstrated to be interoperable, and they haveachieved sufficient deployment to be considered useful. The IETF hasdeveloped specific rules for determining whether those criteria havebeen met, but the rules and their implementation have sometimes notadequately reflected those underlying criteria. The result has beenthat the application of the rules has not resulted in STDs for allprotocols that meet the underlying criteria. This document proposesa process experiment to reclassify standards-track documents whoseinteroperability and utility have been demonstrated by the fact ofdeployment and use in products being used by Internet users.</t>
