      <t>This document establishes a set of extended SMTP policy codes foranti-spam. It seeks to provide additional codes for error texts thatcurrently use the extended SMTP error code 5.7.1. The anti-spamcodes were determined by looking at error texts produced by majorISPs and finding commonalities. The result is a new set of errortexts with associated extended SMTP error codes.</t>
