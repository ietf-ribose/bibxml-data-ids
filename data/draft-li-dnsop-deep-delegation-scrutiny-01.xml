    <abstract>
      <t>The Domain Name System (DNS) relies on caching to ensure its scalability and performance. However, certain behaviors in the DNS delegation and caching mechanisms can be exploited to circumvent domain name revocation. A recently discovered attack, named PHOENIX DOMAIN T2, allows a malicious domain that has been revoked at its parent zone to remain resolvable for an extended period. This is achieved by creating a chain of deeply nested subdomains, effectively keeping the delegation information alive in recursive resolver caches. This document describes the PHOENIX DOMAIN T2 attack mechanism and proposes a set of operational best practices for DNS recursive resolver operators to mitigate this threat. The primary recommendation is for resolvers to apply additional scrutiny to domain names with an excessive number of labels, which is a key characteristic of this attack.</t>
