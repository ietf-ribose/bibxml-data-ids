      <t>This document describes the security model for the OAuth authorization system, which allows a party that holds some authorization to delegate a subset of that authorization to another party, without requiring either party to disclose its credentials to the other. In this document, we describe a set of design constraints, a high-level work flow for establishing authorizations subject to those constraints, and set of security requirements for protocols that implement this model.</t>
