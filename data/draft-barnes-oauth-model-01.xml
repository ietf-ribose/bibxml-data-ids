      <t>This document describes the security model for the OAuthauthorization system, which allows a party that holds someauthorization to delegate a subset of that authorization to anotherparty, without requiring either party to disclose its credentials tothe other. In this document, we describe a set of designconstraints, a high-level work flow for establishing authorizationssubject to those constraints, and set of security requirements forprotocols that implement this model.</t>
