      <t>There is a growing requirement for network operators to supportmulti-address familiy routing and forwarding services across theirbackbone networks. In general this is accomplished by constructing amesh of tunnels between the backbbone provider edge routers and thenadvertising reachability to prefixes through specific tunnels. Thisdocument defines a new subsequence address family identifierassociated with a tunnel end-point information. This enables a singleegress provider edge router to use the border gateway protocol as ascalable and efficient means to distribute its tunnel end-pointinformation to many ingress provider edge routers. The result is thatthe mesh of tunnels is in place and packets can be forwarded throughthese tunnels based on advertised reachability.</t>
