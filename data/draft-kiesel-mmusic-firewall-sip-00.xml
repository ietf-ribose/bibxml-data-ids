      <t>SIP-based multimedia applications dynamically negotiate parametersfor the related media streams, such as UDP port numbers. Therefore,firewalls that want to inspect these streams have to interact withthe session signaling. Several architectures and protocols have beendeveloped for the dynamic control of firewalls on the media path, e.g., MIDCOM, SIMCO, and the NSIS NAT/FW NSLP. This documentinvestigates problems with the interaction of standard SIP (as of RFC3261) and these firewall control protocols, especially with respectto error handling. It will be pointed out how existing SIPextensions can be used for improving the interaction, and whichadditional mechanisms need to be specified. While the actualspecification of such additional mechanisms is out of the scope ofthis document, it solicits feedback and discussion.</t>
