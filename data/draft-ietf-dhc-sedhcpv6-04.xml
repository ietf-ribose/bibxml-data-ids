      <t>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) enables DHCPv6 servers to pass configuration parameters. It offers configuration flexibility. If not being secured, DHCPv6 is vulnerable to various attacks, particularly spoofing attacks. This document analyzes the security issues of DHCPv6 and specifies a Secure DHCPv6 mechanism for communications between DHCPv6 clients and DHCPv6 servers. This document provides a DHCPv6 client/server authentication mechanism based on server's public/private key pairs and client's certificates. The DHCPv6 message exchanges are protected by the signature option and the timestamp option newly defined in this document.</t>
