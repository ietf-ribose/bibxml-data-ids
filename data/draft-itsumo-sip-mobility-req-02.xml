    <abstract>
      <t>Mobility is rapidly becoming a rule rather than an exception in communication services and SIP is gaining widespread acceptance as the signaling protocol for multimedia applications on the Internet. Thus, it is essential to develop a mobility management scheme that utilizes salient features and capabilities of SIP as well as other protocols (e.g., mobile IP) to support mobile services efficiently. Without providing any specific solution, this document presents preliminary requirements and identifies the issues that need to be resolved in order to develop a mobility management scheme for supporting multimedia applications in a SIP signaling and control environment.</t>
