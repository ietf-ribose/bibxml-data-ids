      <t>WebRTC applications rely on ICE candidates to enable peer-to-peer connections between clients in as many network configurations as possible. To maximize the probability to create a direct peer-to- peer connection, client private IP addresses are often exposed without user consent. This is currently used as a way to track users. This document describes a way to share IP addresses with other clients while preserving client privacy. This is achieved by obfuscating IP addresses using dynamically generated names resolvable through Multicast DNS [RFC6763].</t>
