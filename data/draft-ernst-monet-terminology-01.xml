      <t>This document proposes a terminology for defining the problem faced by network mobility. Network mobility is concerned with situations where an entire network changes its point of attachment to the Internet and thus its reachability in the topology. We shall refer to such a network as a mobile network. Network mobility support is to maintain session continuity between nodes in the mobile network and nodes in the global Internet.</t>
