    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a method by which an unconfigured device can use EAP to join a network on which further device onboarding, network attestation or other remediation can be done. While RFC 5216 supports EAP-TLS without a client certificate, that document defines no method by which unauthenticated EAP-TLS can be used. This draft addresses that issue. First, by defining the @eap.arpa domain, and second by showing how it can be used to provide quarantined network access for onboarding unauthenticated devices.</t>
