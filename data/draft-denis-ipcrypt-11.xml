      <t>IP addresses are personally identifiable information that requires protection, yet common techniques such as truncation destroy data irreversibly while providing inconsistent privacy guarantees, and ad- hoc encryption schemes often lack interoperability and security analysis. This document specifies secure, efficient methods for encrypting IP addresses for privacy-preserving storage, logging, and analytics, addressing data minimization concerns raised in [RFC6973]. Four concrete instantiations are defined: ipcrypt-deterministic provides deterministic, format-preserving encryption with 16-byte outputs; ipcrypt-pfx provides deterministic, prefix-preserving encryption that maintains network relationships with native address sizes; while ipcrypt-nd and ipcrypt-ndx introduce randomness to prevent correlation. All methods are reversible with the encryption key and designed for high-performance processing at network speeds.</t>
