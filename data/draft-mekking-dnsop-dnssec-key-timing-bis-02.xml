      <t>This document describes issues surrounding the timing of events related to DNSSEC policy. It presents timelines for various key rollovers and DNSSEC policy changes regarding the key signing scheme. It explicitly identifies the relationships between the various parameters affecting the rollover process. This document updates [draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-key-timing] [MM: If approved] as it covers timelines for key rollovers in more detail and it covers additional key rollover scenarios, including algorithm rollover and single type key rollovers.</t>
