      <t>This document describes a format for encapsulating RDMA (remote direct memory access) information within a TCP data stream. No changes or modification to TCP of any sort are required. This is not intended to be a protocol, but rather a common format that may be shared by multiple client protocols, for instance VI/TCP and iSCSI. By using a common format it is hoped that design of NICs supporting these multiple protocols can be simplified. Sufficient information is included in the RDMA message format to allow determination of the protocol message units, as will as the ability to process an incoming RDMA request even if previous packets are missing and awaiting retransmission. In addition a CRC-32 is included in each segment to enhance the checksum coverage included in TCP.</t>
