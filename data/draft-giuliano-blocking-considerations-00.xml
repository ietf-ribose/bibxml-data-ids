      <t>Geopolitical conflicts can cause policy makers to question whether or not blocking the Internet connectivity for an opposing region is a constructive tactic. This document provides an overview of the various technologies that can be used to implement regional blocking of Internet connectivity and discusses the implications of these options. This document does not advocate any policy or given blocking mechanism, but does attempt to articulate the implications of these blocking technologies for policy makers. The document also intends to help inform policy makers from countries who could be exposed to such blocking techniques on the implications of these methods.</t>
