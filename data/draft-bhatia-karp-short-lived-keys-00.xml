      <t>This draft proposes a generic mechanism for deriving short-livedtraffic keys from the longed-lived keys. The long-lived key could bea preshared secret or a key obtained from some key managementprotocol. The mechanism described in this draft can be used toimplement key rollovers without requiring the participating routersto exchange any additional information.</t>
