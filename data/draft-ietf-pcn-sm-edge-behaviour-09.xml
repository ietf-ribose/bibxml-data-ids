      <t>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) is a means for protecting the quality of service for inelastic traffic admitted to a Diffserv domain. The overall PCN architecture is described in RFC 5559. This memo is one of a series describing possible boundary node behaviours for a PCN-domain. The behaviour described here is that for a form of measurement-based load control using two PCN marking states, not- marked, and excess-traffic-marked. This behaviour is known informally as the Single Marking (SM) PCN-boundary-node behaviour.</t>
