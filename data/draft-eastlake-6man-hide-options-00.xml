      <t>There are increasing requests for a variety IPv6 hop-by-hop options but such IPv6 options and all IPv4 options, are poorly handled, particularly by high speed routers in the core Internet where packets having options are commonly discarded. This document proposes a simple method of transiently hiding such options for part of a packet's path to protect the packet from discard.</t>
