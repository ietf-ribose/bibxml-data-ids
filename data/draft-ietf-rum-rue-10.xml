      <t>Video Relay Service (VRS) is a term used to describe a method by which a hearing person can communicate with a deaf, hard of hearing or hearing impaired user using an interpreter ("Communications Assistant") connected via a videophone to the deaf/hard of hearing/ hearing impaired user and an audio telephone call to the hearing user. The CA interprets using sign language on the videophone link and voice on the telephone link. Often the interpreters may be employed by a company or agency termed a "provider" in this document. The provider also provides a video service that allows users to connect video devices to their service, and subsequently to CAs and other deaf/hard of hearing/hearing impaired users. It is desirable that the videophones used by the deaf, hard of hearing or hearing impaired user conform to a standard so that any device may be used with any provider and that direct video calls between deaf, hard of hearing or hearing impaired users work. This document describes the interface between a videophone and a provider.</t>
