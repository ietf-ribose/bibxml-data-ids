The upcoming setof 3G wireless specifications defined by 3GPP will include SIP[RFC2543] as the session control protocol for IP-based voice andmultimedia. An important requirement for introducing SIP is thedefinition of a security architecture protecting the session controlsignaling.This Internet Draft collects requirements for a SIP securityarchitecture that are related to the use of SIP in 3GPP wirelessnetworks.
