      <t>At present based on a different protocol architecture, 3G wireless standards start to become more and more IP-based. The upcoming set of 3G wireless specifications defined by 3GPP will include SIP [RFC2543] as the session control protocol for IP-based voice and multimedia. An important requirement for introducing SIP is the definition of a security architecture protecting the session control signaling. This Internet Draft collects requirements for a SIP security architecture that are related to the use of SIP in 3GPP wireless networks. It is intended to stimulate the discussion about SIP security and is meant as a source of input for a requirements draft on SIP security.</t>
