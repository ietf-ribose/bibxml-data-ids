      <t>This document is in response to a request made by the TrafficEngineering Working Group for a set of traffic engineering practicesfrom a sample of the ISP engineering community. It reflects thecurrent traffic engineering principles and practices that Cable &amp;Wireless uses for its global 'packet' networks (including IP andMPLS) at the time of publication. It will also identify some of thehistory that has lead to the specific principles and practices aswell as some of the trade-offs between these methods and otherpossible approaches. It is not intended to be a detailed engineeringguide or 'how-to' document.</t>
