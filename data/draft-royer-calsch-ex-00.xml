      <t>A proposal to specify booked persistent data in calendar stores to track 'SEQUENCE' and 'DTSTAMP' property values for CUAs with direct access to calendar stores. With iMIP the iCalendar CUA's do not see the others stored CS data. With WebDAV, HTTP, or FTP access, the CUA can see into the public data of other calendars. The storage of persistent data mandated by [iTIP] has not been standardized yet. This memo proposes a way to standardize on those persistent items. Also included are ways to make the various ways of using the [iCAL] and [iTIP] 'RECURRENCE-ID' property work between vendors and to document the procedures to work with 'RECURRENCE-ID's. Comments about this proposed standard should be sent to the 'calsch@ietf.org' mailing list.</t>
