      <t>OSPF requires a router to recalculate its routing table whenever itreceives a new router or network LSA. However, a topology change,such as a router down event, may cause a number of new LSAs to begenerated. These LSAs may arrive at a router at different times. Inorder to avoid several routing table calculations in quick successionin such cases, commercial routers enforce a hold time betweensuccessive routing table calculations. The hold time based schemes,while limiting the number of routing table calculations, may alsocause undesirable delays in convergence to the topology change. ThisID describes an alternate approach to schedule routing tablecalculations, called LSA Correlation. Rather than using individualLSAs as triggers for routing table calculations, LSA Correlationscheme correlates the information in the LSAs to identify thetopology change. A routing table calculation can be performed whenthe topology change has been identified, which could span multipleLSAs.</t>
