      <t>This document defines a method which helps an SCTP sender to understand when a received SACK acknowledges the original transmission of a TSN or its retransmission. It is done by specifying a new bit, called Retransmit bit (R-bit), in the header of DATA, I-DATA and SACK chunks. The bit is used when a TSN is retransmitted and returned back in the acknowledgement. This document updates [RFC4960] if approved.</t>
