    <abstract>
      <t>This draft describes a framework for providing quantitative IP services with guaranteed QoS. Although the proposed reservation approach is based on a new, lightweight signaling protocol, it can be used with interoperability with other IP QoS techniques such as Diff-Serv, Int-Serv. Distinguishing features of the Boomerang protocol are: * signaling messages are generated only by the initiating node, therefore complexity and intelligence is concentrated in one point enabling simple implementation * flow state aggregation can be suggested to subsequent nodes by appending the Boomerang message, thus good scalability can be achieved * bi-directional reservation can be made independently of the path, which yields a fast and effective reservation process * the only requirement on the far-end node is that it should be able to bounce the Boomerang message back, ensuring quick penetration into the current Internet. There is a lab prototype in which the Boomerang protocol is wrapped in ICMP ECHO / ECHO-REPLY (PING) messages.</t>
