      <t>There are 3 major functions that must be performed to achieve multicast tagswitching. 1) Tag Allocation, which requires each multicast Tag Switching Router (TSR) to have a tag value range that it uses. 2) Tag Binding, using the tags allocated, a TSR must assign them to multicast routes. 3) Tag Binding Distribution, after binding tag values to routes, they must be distributed to other TSRs so they all forward on a common and consistent distribution tree. In this document we present how tags are allocated uniquely across multicast capable TSRs on a LAN and point-to-point IP subnets.</t>
