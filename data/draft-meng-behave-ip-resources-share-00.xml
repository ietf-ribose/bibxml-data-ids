      <t>This document specifies a solution to enable IP addresses sharing among multiple CGN devices, including requesting and releasing IP addresses. Through this solution, the operators can make the dynamic sharing of IP addresses, improve the IP address sharing rate, realize resources'optimization, provide a more convenient platform for operators to manage of IP address pools. In addition, due to the unified management of IP addresses from the AAA server, CGN device MAY reboot without provisioned IP address pools.</t>
