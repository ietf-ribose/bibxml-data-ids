      <t>Recently, the IETF has developed protocols that classify packets in order to treat certain classes or flows of packets in a particular way compared to other classes or flows of packets. The successful wide-scale deployment of these protocols depends on the ability to administer and distribute consistent policy information to different types of network devices as well as hosts and servers that participate in policy decision making, administration, distribution and control. There is a clear need to develop a scalable framework for policy administration and distribution that will enable interoperability among multiple devices and device types that must work together to achieve a consistent implementation of policy. This document defines a language, called the Policy Framework Definition Language (PFDL), that maps requirements for services to be provided by the network as defined in a business specification (e.g., an SLA) to a common vendor- and device-independent intermediate form. This enables policy information and specifications to be shared among the heterogeneous components that comprise the policy framework, and allows multiple vendors to use multiple devices to implement that framework. The PFDL is the common 'currency' that is exchanged between these heterogeneous components to enable them all to perform their function in providing, securing, distributing, and administering policy. The PFDL becomes the way to ensure that multiple vendors interpret the policy the same way while enabling vendors to provide value-added services.</t>
