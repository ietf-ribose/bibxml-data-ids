      <t>This document proposes CTFRC (Coupon TFRC), an end-to-end congestion control mechanism friendly to both continuous streams and TCP flows, based on the modification of TFRC protocol and RED protocol. Taking account of the specific requirements of continuous streams, CTFRC protocol introduces a coupon function into TFRC to represent the bandwidth utilization of each stream, and revises RED to adjust drop probability according to the coupon value carried in each packet header. It inherits the merits of TFRC and promotes the QoS for continuous streams to a much higher level.</t>
