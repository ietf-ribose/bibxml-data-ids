    <abstract>
      <t>Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2116] requires a reliable transport for end-to-end communication. While historically TCP has been used for this purpose, this document proposes an alternative -- the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960]. Similar to TCP, SCTP offers a reliable end-to-end transport connection to applications. Additionally, SCTP offers other innovative services unavailable in TCP. The objectives of this draft are three-fold: (i) to highlight SCTP services that better match HTTP's needs than TCP, (ii) to propose a design for persistent and pipelined HTTP 1.1 transactions over SCTP's multistreaming service, and (iii) to share some lessons learned from implementing HTTP over SCTP. Finally, open issues warranting more discussion and/or investigation are listed.</t>
