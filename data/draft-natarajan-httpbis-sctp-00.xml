      <t>Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2116] requires a reliabletransport for end-to-end communication. While historically TCP hasbeen used for this purpose, this document proposes an alternative --the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960]. Similarto TCP, SCTP offers a reliable end-to-end transport connection toapplications. Additionally, SCTP offers other innovative servicesunavailable in TCP. The objectives of this draft are three-fold: (i)to highlight SCTP services that better match HTTP's needs than TCP,(ii) to propose a design for persistent and pipelined HTTP 1.1transactions over SCTP's multistreaming service, and (iii) to sharesome lessons learned from implementing HTTP over SCTP. Finally, openissues warranting more discussion and/or investigation are listed.</t>
