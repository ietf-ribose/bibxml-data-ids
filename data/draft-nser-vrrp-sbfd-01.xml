      <t>The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) protocol depends on the availability of layer three (3) IPvX connectivity between redundant peers and it can interact with the variant of Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD) protocol to achieve a much faster failure detection. This document describes how to extend the VRRP protocol to support S-BFD as a detection system for Primary Router failures. To announce the use of this implementation, a new VRRP packet type and a new timer are defined. To facilitate and increase the user experience while deploying this implementation, an auto-calculation algorithm for the S-BFD Discriminators is also implemented.</t>
