      <t>This document specifies additions and amendments to RFC 4462. It defines a new key exchange method that uses SHA-2 for integrity and deprecates weak Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups. The purpose of this specification is to modernize the cryptographic primitives used by Generic Security Service (GSS) key exchanges.</t>
