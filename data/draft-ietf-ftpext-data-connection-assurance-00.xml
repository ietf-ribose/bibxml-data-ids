      <t>This document specifies an extension to the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) by which a user and server can exchange data port connection information which may then be used to provide connection assurance. Two new commands are introduced. Through use of these commands and their replies, the user and server exchange information allowing verification of the socket addresses for a data connection prior to actual data transmission over the connection. Implementation of this extension is RECOMMENDED.</t>
