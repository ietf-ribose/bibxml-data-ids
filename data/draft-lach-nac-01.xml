      <t>This draft addresses the need to complement the IP mobility protocols with respect to the co-ordination of a mobile node's network access. The concept of Network Access Agent (NAA) is introduced as a functional entity in the network to assist the mobile node's IP handoff strategy. The Network Access Co-ordination Protocol (NACP) is proposed as an interaction mechanism between the NAA and the mobile node, so that the NAA can provide valuable information and recommendations to the mobile node to consider in IP handoff. The NACP is conceived so that it is completely independent of the Mobile IP protocols.</t>
