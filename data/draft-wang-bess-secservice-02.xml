    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an approach to encrypting selective user data flows using IPsec and then orchestrating the encrypted flows based on the SRv6 Policy path. The method is needed for some users or applications that demand an elevated level of security, necessitating the encryption of their data flows even within networks like SRv6, which are built and managed by Network Service Providers (NSP) and generally considered secure. Employing encryption for selective flows over NSP managed networks, including technologies like SRv6, adds an extra layer of protection, safeguarding valuable data from potential breaches and enhancing overall network security.</t>
