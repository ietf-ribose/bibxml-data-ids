      <t>This document describes the Programming Methodology Framework also known under the PMF methodology. The methodology is based on the manifesto written by Zed A. Shaw [PROGRAMMING-MF-MANIFESTO] which describes a natural approach to software engineering with a strong focus on the act of programming. The PMF methodology uses a soft naming to allow for a non-partisan reference to official engineering or project documents describing one of the most used software engineering methodologies.</t>
