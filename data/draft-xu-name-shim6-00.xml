      <t>This document describes and defines shim6 as a mobility solution forname-based sockets. Using names rather than pseudo IP addresses,shim6 can handle a more diverse set of mobility scenarios. Thesechanges allow a shim6 session to persist even through cases where onenode has no working locators to its correspondent node. If the nameis also a resolvable fully qualified domain name, the connection canbe kept alive even if neither node have a working locator to thecorresponding node. As can be the case if both nodes are mobilesimultaneously.</t>
