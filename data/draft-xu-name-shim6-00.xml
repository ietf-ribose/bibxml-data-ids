    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes and defines shim6 as a mobility solution for name-based sockets. Using names rather than pseudo IP addresses, shim6 can handle a more diverse set of mobility scenarios. These changes allow a shim6 session to persist even through cases where one node has no working locators to its correspondent node. If the name is also a resolvable fully qualified domain name, the connection can be kept alive even if neither node have a working locator to the corresponding node. As can be the case if both nodes are mobile simultaneously.</t>
