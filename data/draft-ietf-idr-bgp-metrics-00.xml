      <t>In this memo, the extended (per-hop) BGP metrics are proposed to allow network operators to implement routing policies which are common cases in the practice but require complicated ad-hoc configurations given the virtual absence of globally significant metrics in BGP-4. BGP is an inter-autonomous system routing protocol designed for TCP/IP internets. The current version is BGP-4 documented in RFC 1654, versions 1-3 are documented in RFCs 1105, 1163 and 1267 accordingly. This document is a supplement to RFC 1654, and describes the new features in terms of differences from BGP-4.</t>
