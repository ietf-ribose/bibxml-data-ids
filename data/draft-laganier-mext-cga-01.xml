      <t>The standard RFC 3775 mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updatessent by a Mobile Node to its Home Agent relies on the use of a pairof unidirectional IPsec security associations between these twonodes. The standard mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updatessent by a Mobile Node to one of its Correspondent Nodes relies on theuse of a return routability test that involves the Correspondent Nodeverifying reachability of the Mobile Node at both its Home Addressand its Care-of Address. The mechanism also requires thecorrespondent node to send keying material to both of theseaddresses.RFC 4866 specifies a standard track mecanism that allows a MobileNode that has configured a Cryptographically Generated Address (RFC3972) as its Home Address to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates sentits Correspondent Nodes based on the properties of itsCryptographically Generated Addresses. Note that CryptographicallyGenerated Addresses have also been used to counter similar securityissues in the context of SHIM6 (RFC 5533) and Secure NeighborDiscovery (RFC 3971.)This memo proposes a mechanism that would let a Mobile Node use asimilar mechanism to secure Mobile IPv6 Binding Updates its sent toits Home Agent with a similar technique based on the use ofCryptographically Generated Addresses.</t>
