      <t>This document presents intelligent network management scenarios based on reinforcement-learning approaches. Nowadays, a heterogeneous network should usually provide real-time connectivity, the type of network management with the quality of real-time data, and transmission services generated by the operating system for an application service. With that reason intelligent management system is needed to support real-time connection and protection through efficient management of interfering network traffic for high-quality network data transmission in the both cloud and IoE network systems. Reinforcement-learning is one of the machine learning algorithms that can intelligently and autonomously provide to management systems over a communication network. Reinforcement-learning has developed and expanded with deep learning technique based on model-driven or data- driven technical approaches so that these trendy techniques have been widely to intelligently attempt an adaptive networking models with effective strategies in environmental disturbances over variety of networking areas.</t>
