      <t>This document describes a proposed standard REST API for obtaining access to TURN services via ephemeral (i.e. time-limited) credentials. These credentials are vended by a web service over HTTP, and then supplied to and checked by a TURN server using the standard TURN protocol. The usage of ephemeral credentials ensures that access to the TURN server can be controlled even if the credentials can be discovered by the user, as is the case in WebRTC where TURN credentials must be specified in Javascript.</t>
