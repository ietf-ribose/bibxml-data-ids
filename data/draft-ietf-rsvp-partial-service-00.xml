      <t>Specifications for providing enhanced qualities of service in the Internet have been defined in [2,4]. Technical and administrative concerns may prevent a network element from offering one or more of these services. In this document, we present a mechanism for dealing with heterogeneity in the set of services offered by different network elements. This approach enables end-to-end service to be composed of different per-hop services while not requiring end systems to be aware of the details of the service provided at each hop.</t>
