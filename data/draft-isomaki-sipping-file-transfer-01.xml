      <t>This document describes use cases and defines requirements for how different types of file transfer services could be integrated into the general Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) based communication framework. It also explores some of the possible solutions to meet those requirements, either based on existing protocol mechanisms or defining minor extensions to them. The purpose of the document is to start the discussion on whether some new standardization work is needed in this area.</t>
