      <t>To ensure a baseline level of interoperability between WebRTC endpoints, a minimum set of required codecs is specified. However, to maximize the possibility to establish the session without the need for audio transcoding, it is also recommended to include in the offer other suitable audio codecs that are available to the browser. This document provides some guidelines on the suitable codecs to be considered for WebRTC endpoints to address the most relevant interoperability use cases.</t>
