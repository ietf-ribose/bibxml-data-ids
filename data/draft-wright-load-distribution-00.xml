    <abstract>
      <t>Online traffic load distribution for a single class of service has been explored extensively given that extensions to IGP can provide loading information to network nodes. To perform traffic engineering of load distribution for multi-service networks, or off line traffic engineering of single service networks, a control mechanism for provisioning bandwidth according to some policy must be provided. This draft identifies the mechanisms that affect load distribution and the controls for mechanisms that affect load distribution to enable policy based traffic engineering of the load distribution to be performed. This draft identifies the mechanisms that affect load distribution and the control for those mechanisms to enable policy based traffic engineering of load distribution. This draft also presents guidelines for the use of these load distribution mechanisms in the context of single IP network administration.</t>
