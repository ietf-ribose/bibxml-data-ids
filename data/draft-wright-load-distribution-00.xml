      <t>Online traffic load distribution for a single class of service hasbeen explored extensively given that extensions to IGP can provideloading information to network nodes. To perform trafficengineering of load distribution for multi-service networks, or offline traffic engineering of single service networks, a controlmechanism for provisioning bandwidth according to some policy mustbe provided. This draft identifies the mechanisms that affect loaddistribution and the controls for mechanisms that affect loaddistribution to enable policy based traffic engineering of the loaddistribution to be performed. This draft identifies the mechanismsthat affect load distribution and the control for those mechanismsto enable policy based traffic engineering of load distribution.This draft also presents guidelines for the use of these loaddistribution mechanisms in the context of single IP networkadministration.</t>
