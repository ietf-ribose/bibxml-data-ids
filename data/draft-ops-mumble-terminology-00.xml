    <abstract>
      <t>Policy Based Networking (PBN) is a topic of interest to many areas within the networking community. Initially considered for the implementation and control of QoS services, several groups are looking to deploy policy-based networks for a wider variety of applications, such as security and VPN. We have found, when trying to coordinate efforts of the different groups, that there are some misunderstandings among the groups, some of which can be attributed to the different terminology that has propagated through the groups. In this draft, we attempt to clear up some of these misunderstandings, concentrating on PBN for Policy Provisioning (rap), Differentiated Services (diffserv), IP Security (ipsp), and general Policy Framework (policy). The terminology discussed here is not meant to be an exhaustive list of PBN-related terms and concepts, but it is intended to represent at least the four areas mentioned. It is NOT intended that this draft defines an architecture or framework for PBN _ each group is clearly qualified to define these for themselves. Instead, we identify the terminology common to all PBN applications and suggest definitions, which are meaningful and useful, yet general enough to be applicable across all PBN applications.</t>
