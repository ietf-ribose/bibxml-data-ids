      <t>Policy Based Networking (PBN) is a topic of interest to many areaswithin the networking community. Initially considered for theimplementation and control of QoS services, several groups arelooking to deploy policy-based networks for a wider variety ofapplications, such as security and VPN. We have found, when tryingto coordinate efforts of the different groups, that there are somemisunderstandings among the groups, some of which can be attributedto the different terminology that has propagated through the groups.In this draft, we attempt to clear up some of thesemisunderstandings, concentrating on PBN for Policy Provisioning(rap), Differentiated Services (diffserv), IP Security (ipsp), andgeneral Policy Framework (policy). The terminology discussed here isnot meant to be an exhaustive list of PBN-related terms andconcepts, but it is intended to represent at least the four areasmentioned.It is NOT intended that this draft defines an architecture orframework for PBN _ each group is clearly qualified to define thesefor themselves. Instead, we identify the terminology common to allPBN applications and suggest definitions, which are meaningful anduseful, yet general enough to be applicable across all PBNapplications.</t>
