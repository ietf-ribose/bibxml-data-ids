      <t>The memo defines a MIME content type for the exchange of sender contact information and user agent capability information beyond what is feasable in the RFC822 header. This exchange is generally accomplished by use of a signature trailer appended to the message. These signatures commonly contain address, phone, and email addressing. This document outlines a formalization and extension of the signature concept to provide a machine readable, internationally friendly form to exchange this information.</t>
