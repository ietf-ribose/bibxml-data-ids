      <t>This document describes a new mode operation for IS-IS. In addition to the existing LAN and point-to-point modes of operation, a point- to-multipoint mode is defined. This mode is useful for operation both on networks with more than two routers where multicast is expensive in comparison to unicast, as well on networks where creating a LAN pseudonode cannot adequately reflect metrics.</t>
