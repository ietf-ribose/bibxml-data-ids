    <abstract>
      <t>Time-Variant Routing (TVR) involves calculating a path, or subpath within a network, taking into account the timing of message transmission or receipt as an integral part of the overall route computation. The results of a TVR computation are influenced by the specific time at which the path is needed, and the computation is performed without any discernible alterations to the network topology or other cost functions associated with the route. This document introduces requirements for TVR computations to improve network communication and resource efficiency.</t>
