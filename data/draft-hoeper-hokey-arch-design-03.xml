      <t>The Handover Keying (HOKEY) Working Group seeks to minimize handoverdelay due to authentication when a peer moves from one point ofattachment to another. Work has progressed on two differentapproaches to reduce handover delay: early authentication (so thatauthentication does not need to be performed during handover), andreuse of cryptographic material generated during an initialauthentication to save time during re-authentication. A startingassumption is that the mobile host or "peer" is initiallyauthenticated using the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP),executed between the peer and an EAP server as defined in RFC 3748.This document documents the HOKEY architecture. Specifically, itdescribes design objectives, the functional environment within whichhandover keying operates, the functions to be performed by the HOKEYarchitecture itself, and the assignment of those functions toarchitectural components. It goes on to illustrate the operation ofthe architecture within various deployment scenarios that aredescribed more fully in other documents produced by the HOKEY WorkingGroup.</t>
