      <t>This document standardises the two marking behaviours of PCN-nodes: threshold marking and excess traffic marking. Threshold marking marks all PCN-packets if the PCN traffic rate is greater than a first configured rate. Excess traffic marking marks a proportion of PCN- packets, such that the amount marked equals the traffic rate in excess of a second configured rate.Requirements Language The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</t>
