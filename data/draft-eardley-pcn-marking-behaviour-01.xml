      <t>This document standardises the two marking behaviours of PCN-nodes:threshold marking and excess traffic marking. Threshold markingmarks all PCN-packets if the PCN traffic rate is greater than a firstconfigured rate. Excess traffic marking marks a proportion of PCN-packets, such that the amount marked equals the traffic rate inexcess of a second configured rate.Requirements LanguageThe key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].</t>
