      <t>In transport networks, there are requirements where Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) end-to-end recovery scheme needs to employ restoration Label Switched Path (LSP) while keeping resources for the working and/or protecting LSPs reserved in the network after the failure occurs. This document reviews how the LSP association is to be provided using Resource Reservation Protocol - Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) signaling in the context of GMPLS end-to-end recovery scheme when using restoration LSP where failed LSP is not torn down. In addition, this document discusses resource sharing-based setup and teardown of LSPs as well as LSP reversion procedures for transport networks. No new signaling extensions are defined by this document, and it is strictly informative in nature.</t>
