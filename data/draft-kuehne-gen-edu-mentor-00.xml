      <t>Education and newcomer orientation activities have existed in the IETF in various forms from the early 1990s (if not earlier). As the IETF and the world around us evolves, we are now rethinking what types of activities are best suited for the future. A mentoring program also exists at IETF that matches newcomers with experienced IETF participants. Mentoring is confined to on-site attendees. This draft proposes a merger of the mentoring and EDU functions as well as potential new activities such as videos, webcasts, and remote participation.</t>
