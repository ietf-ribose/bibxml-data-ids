      <t>This specification defines a Transport Layer Security (TLS) extension which allows endpoints to negotiate the use of encryption with forward secrecy at the beginning of the handshake. Two levels of functionality are defined. Implementations are free to support one or both levels, with the first level incurring no additional computational or round-trip overhead. The TLS cryptographic calculations are unchanged.</t>
