      <t>This draft describes an authentication protocol based on TLS pre shared key (TLS-PSK), RFC 4279. Identity and psk attributes, defined in TLS-PSK are extracted from EMV chips, which are widely deployed for payments transactions. The goal of this protocol is to provide a strong mutual authentication transparent for the end users and guarantying the confidentiality and the integrity of exchanged data over Internet network. This is a new step avoiding the use of static passwords for on-line services, such as electronic banking or electronic payment.</t>
