      <t>The Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) is used to convey pathcomputation requests and responses between Path Computation Clients(PCCs) and Path Computation Elements (PCEs), and also betweencooperating PCEs. In PCEP the path computation requests carry detailsof the constraints and objective functions that the PCC wishes thePCE to apply in its computation.The mechanisms defined for indicating objective functions includethe capability to convey vendor-specific objective functions. Thisdocument defines a facility to carry vendor-specific constraints inPCEP.</t>
