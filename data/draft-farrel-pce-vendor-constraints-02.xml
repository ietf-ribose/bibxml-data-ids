      <t>The Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) is used to convey path computation requests and responses between Path Computation Clients (PCCs) and Path Computation Elements (PCEs), and also between cooperating PCEs. In PCEP the path computation requests carry details of the constraints and objective functions that the PCC wishes the PCE to apply in its computation. The mechanisms defined for indicating objective functions include the capability to convey vendor-specific objective functions. This document defines a facility to carry vendor-specific constraints in PCEP.</t>
