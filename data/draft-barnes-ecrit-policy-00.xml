      <t>The provision of emergency calling services (e.g., 911, 112) has been a critical component in the regulation of telecommunications networks. The technical architectures used by modern Voice-over-IP (VoIP) systems mean that if telecommunications regulators wish to extend emergency calling requirements to VoIP, it will likely be necessary to reconsider the ways in which such requirements are applied, both in terms of what specific mandates are imposed and which entities are subject to them. This document dicusses the fundamental technical requirements for emergency services, how these requirements can be met within the framework of VoIP, and how these solutions approaches create possibilities and limitations for regulatory involvement.</t>
