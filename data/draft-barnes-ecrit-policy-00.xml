      <t>The provision of emergency calling services (e.g., 911, 112) has beena critical component in the regulation of telecommunicationsnetworks. The technical architectures used by modern Voice-over-IP(VoIP) systems mean that if telecommunications regulators wish toextend emergency calling requirements to VoIP, it will likely benecessary to reconsider the ways in which such requirements areapplied, both in terms of what specific mandates are imposed andwhich entities are subject to them. This document dicusses thefundamental technical requirements for emergency services, how theserequirements can be met within the framework of VoIP, and how thesesolutions approaches create possibilities and limitations forregulatory involvement.</t>
