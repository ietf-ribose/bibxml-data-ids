      <t>MoqTransfork is designed to serve live tracks over a CDN to viewers with varying latency and quality targets: the entire spectrum between real-time and VOD. MoqTransfork itself is a media agnostic transport, allowing relays and CDNs to forward the most important content under degraded networks without knowledge of codecs, containers, or even if the content is fully encrypted. Higher level protocols specify how to use MoqTransfork to encode and deliver video, audio, messages, or any form of live content.</t>
