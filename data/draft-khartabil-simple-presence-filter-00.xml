      <t>The Presence event package for the SIP events framework describes the usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications of user presence. The document details how watchers can subscribe for notifications of all authorised and available presence information about the presentity. The document does not describe a mechanism of how filtering of presence information can be achieved. This document defines a presence filter package for the Event Notification Filtering Architecture. The package provides the mechanism whereby a watcher can specify the presence event filtering rules, using XML, for the presence agent (PA) and how that PA is to behave when receiving such filter.</t>
