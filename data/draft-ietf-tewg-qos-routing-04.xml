      <t>This is an informational document submitted in response to a request from the IETF Traffic Engineering Working Group (TEWG) for service provider uses, requirements, and desires for traffic engineering best current practices. As such, the work sets a direction for routing and traffic performance management in networks based on traffic engineering (TE) and QoS best current practices and operational experience, such as used in the AT&amp;T dynamic routing/class-of-service network.</t>
