      <t>As network virtualization is opening the gate to much more innovative services for service providers, Service Function Chaining (SFC) provides a flexible way of service provisioning and facilitates their deployments. This document provides a general abstract architecture for service chaining. It is a flexible and scalable architecture which can fulfill requirements of SFC. Some solutions based on this architecture are also discussed and compared. This architecture can be used as a guideline and also a criterion for the design of SFC.</t>
