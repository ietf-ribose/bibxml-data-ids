      <t>The adoption of AI in network management solutions is becoming a reality. It is mainly supported by the need to resolve complex problems arisen from the acceptance of SDN/NFV technologies as well as network slicing. This allows current computer and network system infrastructures to constantly grow in complexity, in parallel to the demands of users. However, exploiting the possibilities of AI is not an easy task. There has been a lot of effort to make Machine Learning (ML) solutions reliable and acceptable but, at the same time, other mechanisms have been forgotten. It is the particular case of reasonsing. Although it can provide enormous benefits to management solutions by, for example, infering new knowledge and applying differnet kind of rules (eg.g logical) to choose from several actions, it has received little attention. While ML solutions work with data, so their only requirement from the network infrastructure is data retrieval, reasoning solutions work in collaboration to the network they are managing. This makes the challenges arisen from intelligent reasoning to be a key for the evolution of network management towards the full adoption of AI.</t>
