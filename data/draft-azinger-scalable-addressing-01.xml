      <t>This document presents a scalable architecture for assigning andaggregating IPv6 address space. The current IPv4 assignment andaddressing architecture has been successful in helping to scale theIPv4 routing architecture. This same architecture, when carriedforward to IPv6, will help to ensure that the IPv6 routingarchitecture is sustainable.</t>
