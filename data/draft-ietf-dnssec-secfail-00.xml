      <t>This document identifies the situations where a signature verification fails in a recursive security aware DNS server, and how DNS servers should handle these cases, and the errors that should be reported to DNS resolvers. This document proposes a new error to be returned by DNSSEC capable servers. A DNSSEC server acting as a recursive server MUST validate the signatures on RRsets in a response it passes on; this draft addresses the case when the data it receives fails signature verification. The end resolver must be notified of this occurence in such a way that it will not confuse it with another error.</t>
