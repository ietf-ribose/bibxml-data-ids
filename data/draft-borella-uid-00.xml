      <t>In this draft we discuss the attributes and characteristics of an Internet architecture based on assigning unique identifiers to all physical devices, users, services, and agents. A supporting location-finding mechanism is also defined. The advantages of such as architecture are presented. Please note: this discussion is still in the preliminary stages and should be considered as such.</t>
