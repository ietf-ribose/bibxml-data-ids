      <t>This document describes a set of TCP options to support the migrationof an active TCP connection across IP addresses and TCP port numbers.Using this option, a TCP peer can open a migrateable connection,transfer one or more bytes on it, and continue the connection fromanother IP address/TCP port pair in an application-transparentfashion. The set of addresses or ports from where a connection mightbe continued need not be known in advance. Security againstconnection hijacking is achieved using a secret cryptographic cookienegotiated through an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman [ANSI-X962]exchange during connection establishment. The initiation ofmigration can be done either by one of the communicating peers, or bya trusted third-party that presents the negotiated cryptographiccookie.</t>
