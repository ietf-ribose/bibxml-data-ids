      <t>This document describes a set of TCP options to support the migration of an active TCP connection across IP addresses and TCP port numbers. Using this option, a TCP peer can open a migrateable connection, transfer one or more bytes on it, and continue the connection from another IP address/TCP port pair in an application-transparent fashion. The set of addresses or ports from where a connection might be continued need not be known in advance. Security against connection hijacking is achieved using a secret cryptographic cookie negotiated through an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman [ANSI-X962] exchange during connection establishment. The initiation of migration can be done either by one of the communicating peers, or by a trusted third-party that presents the negotiated cryptographic cookie.</t>
