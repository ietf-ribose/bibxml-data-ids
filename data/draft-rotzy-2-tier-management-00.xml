    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes a two-tier resource management model fordifferentiated services networks. Following the approach taken bythe Internet routing architecture, we propose that bilateral serviceagreements are made for aggregate border-crossing traffic betweenneighboring administrative domains. We also propose thatadministrative domains individually make their own decision onstrategies and protocols to use for internal resource management andQoS support, both to meet internal client needs and to fulfillexternal commitments. We sketch out one specific realization of this two-tier model byhaving a Bandwidth-Broker (BB) as the resource manager for eachdomain and a BB-to-BB protocol, equivalent to BGP in routing, forinter-domain resource management. We believe that this two-tierresource managementmodel matches the direction of, and complement the work by, thediffserv effort. We also expect this two-tier model to scale wellin the global, heterogeneous Internet. Note: This draft contains pictures that could not be included in thetext version.
