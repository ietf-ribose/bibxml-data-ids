      <t>Routing Bridges (RBridges) implement the TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol which provide a transparent least- cost frame routing in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies, while also inherently providing loop mitigation. As RBridges are deployed in real-world situations, operators will need tools for debugging problems that arise. This document specifies a set of RBridge features for operations, administration, and maintenance (OAM) purposes in RBridge campuses. The features specified in this document include tools for traceroute, ping, and error reporting.</t>
