      <t>The Privacy-Enhanced Electronic Mail system (PEM) [1] provides an inclusive standard as adopted by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) to provide secure electronic mail over the Internet. The PEM protocols [2] provide for encryption, authentication, message integrity, and key management. PEM's encryption [3] accomplishes privacy of messages using DES in CBC mode; Integrity [4] via a cryptographic hash algorithm called a Message Integrity Check (MIC)using either MD2 or MD5; Symmetric key management [5] using DES in ECB mode or triple-DES using two keys (EDE mode); and supports [6] public-key certificates for key management, using the RSA algorithm and X.509 standard for certificate structure. This document describes the use of a Spiral Network Algorithm Compression routine integrated into the message-text encryption routines to provide enhanced confidentiality and smaller message size without impacting the throughput of the PEM system. It is the intention of the author to seek guidance from the readers on methods of testing and certification other than those listed herein.</t>
