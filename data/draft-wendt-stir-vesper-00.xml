    <abstract>
      <t>This document extends the STIR architecture by specifying the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Selective Disclosure JWT (SD-JWT) for representing persona related information intended to be the output of a Know Your Customer (KYC) or Know Your Business (KYB) type of vetting process. It defines entities called Vetting Agents (VA) that perform a vetting of persona related information and can issue a verifiable token bearing the VA signature, containing information that can be disclosed or selectively disclosed to an interested party. The Vetted Entity (VE) can hold this token in selectively disclosable forms to disclose specific information to the third parties. The vesper token enables the delivery and verification of information with privacy protecting mechanism in a complete, selective or zero knowledge manner specifically supported by the SD- JWT. This document also describes an API standard to be supported/ hosted by a Vetting Agent (VA), which allow vetted parties to present tokens proving their KYC/KYB conformance, and incorporates proof of possession to ensure the legitimacy of the entity presenting the token.</t>
