      <t>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [RFC1661] provides a standard method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. PPP also defines an extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP), which can be used to negotiate authentication methods, as well as an Encryption Control Protocol (ECP) [RFC1968], used to negotiate data encryption over PPP links, and a Compression Control Protocol (CCP) [RFC1962], used to negotiate compression methods. The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [EAP] is a PPP extension that provides support for additional authentication methods within PPP. The Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol [ISAKMP] combined with the Oakley [Oakley] key exchange protocol enables secure, mutually authenticated security association exchanges between two endpoints. This document describes how ISAKMP provides for these mechanisms within EAP.</t>
