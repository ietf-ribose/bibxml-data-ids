    <abstract>
      <t>Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) defines a set of protocols for the creation of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in various switching technologies. The GMPLS User-Network Interface (UNI) was developed in RFC4208 in order to be applied to an overlay network architectural model. This document examines a number of GMPLS UNI application scenarios. It shows how techniques developed after the GMPLS UNI can be applied to automate or enable critical processes for these applications. This document also suggests simple extensions that could be made to existing technologies to further enable the UNI and points out some unresolved issues.</t>
