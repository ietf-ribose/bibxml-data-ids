      <t>This document describes the MultiPoint Relay Flooding (MPRF) protocol for maintenance of efficient flooding structures in mobile ad-hoc networks. The protocol is an adaptation of the classical flooding algorithm, with the difference that many nodes are relieved of the responsibility to relay flooded messages while still ensuring that all nodes receive the messages. The key concept used in the protocol is that of multipoint relays (MPRs). MPRs are selected nodes which are the only nodes needed to forward messages during the flooding process. This technique substantially reduces the message overhead as compared to the more straightforward and well-known flooding mechanism, where every node retransmits each message just once, upon receiving the first copy of the message. The protocol is particularly suitable for dense networks.</t>
