      <t>This document describes the MultiPoint Relay Flooding (MPRF) protocolfor maintenance of efficient flooding structures in mobile ad-hocnetworks. The protocol is an adaptation of the classical floodingalgorithm, with the difference that many nodes are relieved of theresponsibility to relay flooded messages while still ensuring thatall nodes receive the messages. The key concept used in the protocolis that of multipoint relays (MPRs). MPRs are selected nodes whichare the only nodes needed to forward messages during the floodingprocess. This technique substantially reduces the message overheadas compared to the more straightforward and well-known floodingmechanism, where every node retransmits each message just once, uponreceiving the first copy of the message. The protocol is particularlysuitable for dense networks.</t>
