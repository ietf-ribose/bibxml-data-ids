      <t>This document describes an extension to the CONNECT-IP HTTP method. This extension defines a new Flow Forwarding Mode which supports optimization for individual IP flows forwarded to the targeted peer. * IMPORTANT NOTE: This draft exists only to demonstrate the feasibility of defining CONNECT-IP Flow Forwarding Mode as an extension to CONNECT-IP. The overwhelming majority of the content in this draft was copied from draft-kuehlewind-masque-connect-ip- 01. A list of changes from that design is available in an appendix to this document. All credit for flow forwarding should go to the authors of that document. However, all blame for any errors in this draft should be attributed to its editor. The editor's intent is to step down as editor of this draft and have the authors of draft-kuehlewind-masque-connect-ip take on that role. Discussion Venues This note is to be removed before publishing as an RFC. Discussion of this document takes place on the Multiplexed Application Substrate over QUIC Encryption Working Group mailing list (masque@ietf.org), which is archived at https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/masque/.</t>
