      <t>RFC 7997 allowed non-ASCII characters in RFCs. This document updates RFC 2026, removing from it the requirement that Internet-Drafts be fully in ASCII. This document also updates RFC 5657 and RFC 7997 to note the allowance of non-ASCII characters in Internet-Drafts. [[RFC-Editor: please replace the second character of my surname by U+00E2 when publishing as RFC in the header and in all pages. Non-ASCII characters are allowed in RFCs as per RFC 7997.]]</t>
