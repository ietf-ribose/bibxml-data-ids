      <t>This document specifies a Preferred Path Routing (PPR) mechanism to simplify the path description of data plane traffic in Segment Routing (SR) deployments. PPR aims to mitigate the MTU and data plane processing issues that may result from SR packet overheads; and also supports traffic measurement, accounting statistics and further attribute extensions along the paths. Preferred Path Routing is achieved through the addition of descriptions to IS-IS advertised prefixes, and mapping those to a PPR data-plane identifier.</t>
