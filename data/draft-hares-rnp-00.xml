      <t>The CAPWAP problem statement describes a problem that needs to be addressed before a wireless LAN (WLAN) network designer can construct a solution composed of Wireless Termination Points (WTP) and Access Controllers (AC) from multiple, different vendors. One of the primary goals is to find a solution that solves the interoperability between the two classes of devices (WTPs and ACs) which then enables an AC from one vendor to control and manage a WTP from another. RNP is a protocol that supports the management of WTP's Radio information, Session Parameters, Data Forwarding and interaction with the Wireless Portal. The RNP protocol consists of five sub- protocols: RNP-DT (Data Tunneling), RNP-SM (Session Management), RNP-RC (Radio Control), RNP-DF (Data Forwarding), and RNP-WP (Wireless Portal). The RTP protocol with it's family of protocol provides a complete control situation for the CAPWAP environment. In many ways, RNP provides a super set of the RNP requiremetns.</t>
