    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes how to layer [CMP] over [HTTP]. A simple method for doing so is described in section 5.4 of [CMP], but that method does not accommodate a polling mechanism, which may be required in some environments. This document specifies an alternative method which uses the polling protocol defined in section 5.2 of [CMP]. A new Content-Type for messages is also defined.</t>
