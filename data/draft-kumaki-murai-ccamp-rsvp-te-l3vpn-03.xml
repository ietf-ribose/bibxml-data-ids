      <t>IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) provide connectivity between sitesacross an IP backbone. These VPNs can be supported using BGP/MPLS andthe connections can be created by using MPLS Traffic Engineered (TE)Label Switched Paths (LSPs). New RSVP-TE extensions are required to support multiple MPLS-TE basedBGP/MPLS IP-VPNs that are interconnected via the same Provider Edge (PE) routers. These extensions are necessary so that RSVP control messages from the Customer Edge (CE) equipment, such as Path messagesand Resv messages, are appropriately handled by the PE routers. Thisdocument defines the procedure and objects that enable a PE routerto distinguish between BGP/MPLS IP-VPNs.</t>
