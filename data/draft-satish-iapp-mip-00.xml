      <t>With WLAN hotspots becoming more wide spread, there is growing interestamong cellular service providers in WLAN-Cellular interworking/roamingarchitectures. Service providers are looking at deployment ofinterworking heterogeneous wireless access points. There is also agrowing breed of terminals trying to build a capability to roam between 3G and 802.xx technologies. Working groups within IETF andIEEE 802.21 are involved in defining seamless roaming standards.802.21 is attempting to define roaming standards not just from one802-based network to another, but also between 802-based networksand 3G cellular network. Support for handoff between heterogeneouswireless networks is becoming vital. Mobile IP has always been themacro network mobility protocol of choice where as the IAPP - InterAccess Point Protocol (802.11f) has been recommended as the roamingprotocol between 802.11 access points.This draft suggests a mechanism of supporting handoff between IAPPsupported 802.xx devices and 3G packet core networks.</t>
