      <t>The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to roam and attach to different access networks without disrupting the ongoing sessions that nodes of the network may have. By extending the Mobile IPv6 support to Mobile Routers, nodes of the network are not required to support any kind of mobility, since packets must go through the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA) bi-directional tunnel. Communications from/to a mobile network have to traverse the Home Agent, and therefore better paths may be available. Additionally, this solution adds packet overhead, due to the encapsulation. This document describes an approach to the Route Optimisation for NEMO, called Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation for NEMO (MIRON). MIRON enables mobility-agnostic nodes within the mobile network to directly communicate (i.e. without traversing the MRHA bi-directional tunnel) with Correspondent Nodes. The solution is based on the Mobile Router performing the Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation signalling on behalf of the nodes of the mobile network. This document (in an appendix) also analyses how MIRON fits each of the NEMO RO Aeronautics requirements.</t>
