      <t>Voice messaging evolved as telephone answering service into a fullsend, receive, and forward messaging paradigm with unique messagefeatures, semantics and usage patterns. Voice messaging wasintroduced on special purpose computers that interface to a telephoneswitch and provide call answering and voice messaging services.Traditionally, messages sent from one voice messaging system toanother were transported using analog networking protocols based onDTMF signaling and analog voice playback. As the demand fornetworking increases, there was a need for a standard high-qualitydigital protocol to connect these machines. VPIM has successfullydemonstrated its usefulness as this new standard. VPIM is widelyimplemented and is seeing deployment in early adopter customernetworks. This document clarifies ambiguities found in the earlierspecification and is consistent with implementation practice. Theprofile is referred to as VPIM (Voice Profile for Internet Mail) inthis document.This second revision of the version 2 of obsoletes RFC 2421 whichless precisely describes version 2 of the profile.</t>
