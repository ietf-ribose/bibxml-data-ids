      <t>This document presents POP, a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) programming model for the Protocol Oblivious Forwarding (POF) network. POF is an SDN forwarding plane technology proposed by Huawei. A POF forwarding element (FE) does no need to understand the packet format, and can be programmed to support new forwarding protocols. POP enables user to define forwarding protocols and program the POF SDN network on the centralized control plane with algorithmic policies that are expressed with high-level programming languages.</t>
