    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies an architectural framework for the MPLS Network Actions (MNA) technologies. MNA technologies are used to indicate actions that impact the forwarding or other processing (such as monitoring) of the packet along the Label Switched Path (LSP) of the packet and to transfer any additional data needed for these actions. The document provides the foundation for the development of a common set of network actions and information elements supporting additional operational models and capabilities of MPLS networks. Some of these actions are defined in existing MPLS specifications, while others require extensions to existing specifications to meet the requirements found in "Requirements for Solutions that Support MPLS Network Actions (MNA)".</t>
