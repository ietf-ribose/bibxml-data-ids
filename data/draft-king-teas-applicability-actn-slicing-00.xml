      <t>Network abstraction is a technique that can be applied to a network domain to manage network resources to create a virtualized network that is under the control of a network operator (or perhaps the customer). Network slicing is an approach to network operations that builds on the concept of network abstraction to provide programmability, flexibility, and modularity. It uses techniques such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to create multiple logical (virtual) networks, each tailored for a given use case, on top of a common network. These logical networks are referred to as network slices. A network slice does not necessarily represent dedicated resources in the server network, but does constitute a commitment by the service provider to provide a specific level of service. The Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) defines an SDN-based architecture that relies on the concepts of network and service abstraction to detach network and service control from the underlying data plane. This document outlines the applicability of ACTN to network slicing in an IETF technology network. It also identifies the features of network slicing not currently within the scope of ACTN, and indicates where ACTN might be extended.</t>
