      <t>Based on life deployments and three interoperability events, this document provides advice to network operators about best practices when implementing IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) networks. It is principally addressed to system integrators and solution providers, including those that do not yet support SPB. Some advice to implementers is also included. The intention of the advice is to facilitate multi vendor network deployments as well as provide guidance for new installations.</t>
