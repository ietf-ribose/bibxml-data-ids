      <t>A number of policy and technical development efforts related to the DNS are underway within the engineering community, ICANN-circles and elsewhere due to the evolving scope and utility of DNS, domain name registries and related entities. It is important that accepted definitions act as the foundation for this work. This document is an attempt to create an optional starting point for the requisite dialogue that will ultimately foster the determination and acceptance of these new technical and contractual protocols. This document obsoletes &lt;draft-rader-dnwhois-defn-00.txt&gt;, &lt;draft-ietf- provreg-dn-defn-01.txt&gt; and &lt;draft-rader-dn-defn-00&gt;.</t>
