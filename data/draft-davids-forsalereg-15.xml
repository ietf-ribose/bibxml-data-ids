    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines an operational convention that uses the reserved underscored DNS leaf node name "_for-sale" to indicate that the parent domain name is available for purchase. The convention can be deployed without disrupting existing operations, and it may be applied even when the domain name is still actively in use. This document is not an IETF consensus document: it is published for informational purposes.</t>
