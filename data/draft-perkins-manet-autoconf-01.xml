      <t>If a node lacks an IP address, it cannot yet participate in ad hocnetworks as currently designed, because the connectivity in an ad hocnetwork is typically determined by mechanisms that depend upon usingthe IP address as the identifier for the nodes in the ad hoc network.In this document, a mechanism by which a node in an ad hoc networkmay autoconfigure an IP address which is unique throughout theconnected portion of the ad hoc network is specified. Specifically,mechanisms for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks, which are isolated fromInternet connectivity, are described.</t>
