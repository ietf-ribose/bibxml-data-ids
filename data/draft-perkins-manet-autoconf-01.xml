      <t>If a node lacks an IP address, it cannot yet participate in ad hoc networks as currently designed, because the connectivity in an ad hoc network is typically determined by mechanisms that depend upon using the IP address as the identifier for the nodes in the ad hoc network. In this document, a mechanism by which a node in an ad hoc network may autoconfigure an IP address which is unique throughout the connected portion of the ad hoc network is specified. Specifically, mechanisms for both IPv4 and IPv6 networks, which are isolated from Internet connectivity, are described.</t>
