      <t>This document specifies the details of the Host Identity ProtocolDiet EXchange (HIP DEX). HIP DEX is a variant of the HIP BaseEXchange (HIP BEX) [RFC5201-bis] specifically designed to use as fewcrypto primitives as possible yet still deliver the same class ofsecurity features as HIP BEX.The design goal of HIP DEX is to be usable by sensor devices that arememory and processor constrained. Like HIP BEX it is expected to beused together with another suitable security protocol, such as theEncapsulated Security Payload (ESP). HIP DEX can also be useddirectly as a keying mechanism for a MAC layer security protocol asis supported by IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE.802-15-4.2006].</t>
