    <abstract>
      <t>The application-centric deployment of 'Internet' services has increased over the past ten years with many millions of applications providing user-centric services, executed on increasingly more powerful smartphones that are supported by Internet-based cloud services in distributed data centres, the latter mainly provided by large scale players such as Google, Amazon and alike. This draft outlines a vision for evolving those data centres towards executing app-centric micro-services; we dub this evolved data centre as an AppCentre. Complemented with the proliferation of such AppCentres at the edge of the network, they will allow for such micro-services to be distributed across many places of execution, including mobile terminals themselves, while specific micro-service chains equal today's applications in existing smartphones. We outline the key enabling technologies that needs to be provided for such evolution to be realized, including references to ongoing standardization efforts in key areas.</t>
