      <t>This text documents the current usage of 'P-Charge-Info', an existing private Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) header field (P-header) used to convey billing information about the party to be charged. This P-Header is currently used in production by several equipment vendors and carriers. This document is submitted to request the registration of this header field with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). NOTE: This document is a simplified version of the document previously known as 'draft-york-dispatch-p-charge-info'.</t>
