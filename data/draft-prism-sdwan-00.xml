      <t>This document specifies PRISM, an application-aware traffic steering protocol for Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN). PRISM provides deep application identification, per-flow tracking, Service Level Agreement (SLA) enforcement, and policy-based path selection integration with Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6). PRISM is designed as a companion protocol to CONDUIT (Cryptographic Orchestration of Network Distributed Underlay for IPsec Transport), together providing a complete open-standard SD-WAN solution. CONDUIT manages the encrypted tunnel fabric while PRISM provides the application intelligence and policy enforcement. The protocol is fully programmable via gRPC, supports distributed and centralized deployment models, and mandates compliance with Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0 (CNSA 2.0) cryptographic requirements.</t>
