      <t>The purpose of a referral is to enable a given entity in a multiparty application to pass information to another party. This memo specifies a Generic Referral Object (GRO) to be used in the context of referrals. The proposed object is compact and is application- independent. Both IPv4 and IPv6 schemes are supported, as well as upper layer identifiers. Additional information to characterise an enclosed reference is also described. To allow proper interpretation of referrals, a new notion of scope identifiers is introduced.</t>
