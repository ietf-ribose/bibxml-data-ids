      <t>This document considers proposals to enable the negotiation of trust anchors in TLS. It makes three basic arguments: that trust negotiation is not helpful in addressing the problems it claims to address, that trust negotiation instead comes with material harms to the critical trust infrastructure of the Internet, and that the proposed mechanisms for deploying trust negotiation are unworkable. This draft goes on to discuss simpler and more effective solutions to these problems.</t>
