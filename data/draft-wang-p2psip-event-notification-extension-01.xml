      <t>The p2p technology is data centric. Data objects are distributed in the p2p overlay according to routing algorithm.Applications access the data objects via peer/client protocol or gateways, some of which need data replicas to be synchronized in real time. This can be achieved by introducing a Subscribe/Notify mechanism to p2psip. This document describes the Subscribe/Notify mechanism extension for p2psip, and also defines several new methods as needed.</t>
