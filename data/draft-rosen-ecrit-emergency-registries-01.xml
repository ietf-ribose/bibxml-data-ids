    <abstract>
      <t>Multiple emergency services standards organizations are developing standards based on IETF emergency call standards and other IETF protocols. There is a desire among these organizations to use common registries not tied to a particular country or national Standards Development Organization (SDO), in the long term pursuit of a single worldwide standard. This document asks IANA to create a set of registries and provides processes for expanding the set and populating them.</t>
