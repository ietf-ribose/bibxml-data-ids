      <t>This document describes a payload format for transporting JPEG 2000video streams using RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol).JPEG 2000 video streams are formed as a continuous series of JPEG2000 still images which is next-generation still image coding.The JPEG 2000 payload format described in this document has three features: (1) Improvement of robustness to packet loss byfragmenting JPEG 2000 packet units intelligently, (2) Persistency ofmain header to minimize loss effect, (3) Priority information fieldfor scalable delivery from the same codestream.These will allow the scalability and robustness of JPEG 2000 to bemaximized in streaming applications.</t>
