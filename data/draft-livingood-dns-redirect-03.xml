      <t>The objective of this document is to describe the design of so-called DNS Redirect services deployed today by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), DNS Application Service Providers (ASPs), and other organizations providing so-called DNS Redirect services via their recursive DNS servers, as well as to describe the recommended practices regarding relating to DNS redirect. This document specifically and narrowly addresses those cases where DNS Redirect is being utilized to provide a web error redirect service to end users, and describes the critical implications for DNS Redirect when DNSSEC is deployed.</t>
