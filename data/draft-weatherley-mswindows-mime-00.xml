      <t>This memo registers MIME [RFC-MIME] Content-Types for a number of file formats common to the Microsoft Windows environment. The intention is to aid interoperability between mail systems, and to enumerate possible conversions at gateways. This document does not provide detailed descriptions of individual formats, since published descriptions are already available from other sources, notably [SDK4], and are, in some cases, quite complex.</t>
