      <t>Border Gateway Protocol [1] is an inter-autonomous system routing protocol designed for TCP/IP internets. This document describes an extension to BGP which may be used to create a confederation of autonomous systems which is represented as one single autonomous system to BGP peers external to the confederation. The intention of the proposed technique is to aid in policy administration and reduce the management complexity of maintaining a large autonomous system.</t>
