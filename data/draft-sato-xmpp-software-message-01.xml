      <t>In RFC2779 [RFC2779] and RFC2778 [RFC2778], XMPP [RFC3920] clientis defined as "PRINCIPALS are the people, groups, and/or softwarein the "real world" outside the system that use the system as ameans of coordination and communication. Considering thisdescription, it does not matter whether the user of end node ishuman or software. However, current specification of XMPP isexpected that there will be a human in front of the client. So,there is no consideration for looping the message between softwaresand processing message that human will not be able to react.Recently system and software are replying in return ofhuman. Moreover, by making client act like a human, new networkservice can be made. There are many of these called "bots"already, but there is a possibility which can aggregate or controlremote resources.By clarifying models of usage and problem, thisdocument aims to use XMPP in software-to-software andhuman-to-software models not only human-to-human model.</t>
