      <t>This memo describes the distribution mechanism of route optimizationhints, which can be used by a mobile node to determine when the nodeshould initiate the route optimization procedure when communicatingwith correspondent nodes. Usually, a mobile node will perform ROprocedure to any correspondent node as described in Mobile IPv6specification [1]. However, in some cases, it is better not toperform RO. A typical example is a firewalled network. This memoalso describes a configuration of a firewall which makes mobile nodespossible to move between an intranet and the Internet by using ROhints.</t>
