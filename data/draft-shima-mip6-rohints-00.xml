      <t>This memo describes the distribution mechanism of route optimization hints, which can be used by a mobile node to determine when the node should initiate the route optimization procedure when communicating with correspondent nodes. Usually, a mobile node will perform RO procedure to any correspondent node as described in Mobile IPv6 specification [1]. However, in some cases, it is better not to perform RO. A typical example is a firewalled network. This memo also describes a configuration of a firewall which makes mobile nodes possible to move between an intranet and the Internet by using RO hints.</t>
