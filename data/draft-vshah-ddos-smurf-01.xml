      <t>Host Requirements RFC1122 states that an ICMP Echo Request destinedto an IP broadcast or IP multicast address MAY be silentlydiscarded. By discarding all broadcast ICMP Echo Requests, the enduser may lose valuable diagnostic capability. By forwarding somebroadcast ICMP Echo Requests, the host may be used as launchingplatform for Smurf Attacks[1]. This draft describes a solution forselectively dropping broadcast ICMP Echo Requests based on whetherthe source address is within the network or from outside thenetwork. Any host implementing this solution ensures that it doesnot participate in a Smurf attack irrespective of whether respondingto broadcast ICMP Echo Requests is enabled or disabled on it.</t>
