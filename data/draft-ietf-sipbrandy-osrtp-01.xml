    <abstract>
      <t>Opportunistic Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (OSRTP) allows encrypted media to be used in environments where support for encryption is not known in advance, and not required. OSRTP is an implementation of Opportunistic Security, as defined in RFC 7435. OSRTP does not require advanced SDP extensions or features and is fully backwards compatible with existing secure and insecure implementations. OSRTP is not specific to any key management technique for SRTP. OSRTP is a transitional approach useful for migrating existing deployments of real-time communications to a fully encrypted and authenticated state.</t>
