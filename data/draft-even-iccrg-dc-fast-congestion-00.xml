      <t>Fast congestion control is discussed in academic papers as well as in the different standard bodies. There is no one proposal for providing a solution that will work for all use cases leading to multiple approaches. By congestion control we refer to an end to end solution and not only to the congestion control algorithm on the sender side. This document describes the current state of flow control and congestion for Data Centers and proposes future directions.</t>
