    <abstract>
      <t>This draft gives a summary of findings about routing optimization of not-via addresses [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-notvia-addresses] and LFAs [RFC5286] in IP networks. The optimization is done only by tuning IP link costs. Optimization goals for both IP FRR techniques is the maximum link utilization in the failure-free scenario and for a set of failure scenarios such as all single link (and node) failures as well as the failure coverage by LFAs. For LFAs, the failure coverage is another optimization goal.</t>
