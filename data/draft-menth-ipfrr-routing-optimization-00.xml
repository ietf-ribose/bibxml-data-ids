      <t>This draft gives a summary of findings about routing optimization ofnot-via addresses [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ipfrr-notvia-addresses] and LFAs[RFC5286] in IP networks. The optimization is done only by tuning IPlink costs. Optimization goals for both IP FRR techniques is themaximum link utilization in the failure-free scenario and for a setof failure scenarios such as all single link (and node) failures aswell as the failure coverage by LFAs. For LFAs, the failure coverageis another optimization goal.</t>
