    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents an extension to the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol for the purpose of a group key management. The protocol is in conformance with the Multicast Security (MSEC) key management architecture, which contains two components: member registration and group rekeying. Both components require a Group Controller/Key Server to download IPsec group security associations to authorized members of a group. The group members then exchange IP multicast or other group traffic as IPsec packets. This document obsoletes RFC 6407. This documents also updates RFC 7296 by renaming a transform type 5 from "Extended Sequence Numbers (ESN)" to the "Replay Protection (RP)" and by renaming IKEv2 authentication method 0 from "Reserved" to "NONE".</t>
