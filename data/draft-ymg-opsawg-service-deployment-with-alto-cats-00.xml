    <abstract>
      <t>The deployment of service instances across distributed interconnected edge-cloud environments can be optimized in terms of performance expectations and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) satisfaction when performed taken into account both network and compute metrics. In order to do so, this document primarily concentrates on existing standardized mechanisms, namely ALTO and CATS, to facilitate such integration of metrics. The ALTO protocol can be extended to expose compute metrics from a cloud manager to a network orchestrator or as part of the network and cost maps, enabling improved deployment of compute service instances based on joint awareness of both network and computing information. This document proposes protocol extensions, workflows, and operational considerations for ALTO enhancements using CATS metrics.</t>
