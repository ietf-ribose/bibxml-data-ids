      <t>End-by-Hop Transmission Protocol (EHTP) is the connection-oriented transport service for the reliable or unreliable delivery of data packets with possible violation of a sequence. It has the own address space compatible with Unified Memory Space Protocol (UMSP, RFC3018 [5]). EHTP includes the gateway protocol, which supports labels and dynamic resources deallocating. Networks with non- overlapping or incompatible addresses space may be united at EHTP layer with end-to-end interaction and with preservation of a transparency.</t>
