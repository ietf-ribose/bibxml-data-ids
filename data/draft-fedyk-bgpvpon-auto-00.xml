      <t>Consider a service provider network that offers Optical Virtual Private Network (OVPN) service. An important goal in the OVPN service is the ability to support what is known as _single end provisioning_, where addition of a new port to a given OVPN would involve configuration/provisioning changes only on the devices connected to that port. Another important goal in the OVPN service is the ability to establish/terminate an optical connection between a pair of (existing) ports within an OVPN without involving configuration/provisioning changes in any of the provider devices. In this document we describe a set of mechanisms that accomplishes these goals.</t>
