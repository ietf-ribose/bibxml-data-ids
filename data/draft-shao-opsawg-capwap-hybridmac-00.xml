    <abstract>
      <t>The CAPWAP protocol supports two modes of operation: Split and Local MAC (medium access control), which has been described in [RFC5415].There are many functions in IEEE 802l.11 MAC layer that have not yet been clearly defined whether they belong to either the AP (Access Point) or the AC (Access Controller)in the Split and Local modes. Because different vendors have their own definition of these two models, depending upon the vendor many MAC layer functions continue to be mapped differently to either the AP or AC. If there is no clear definition of split MAC and local MAC, then operators will not only need to perform vendor specific configurations in their network but will continue to experience difficulty in interoperating APs and ACs from different vendors.</t>
