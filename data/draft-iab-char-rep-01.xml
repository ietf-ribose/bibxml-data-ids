      <t>This document describes a set of considerations and strategies to use in increasing the character repertoire available in a protocol element or suite of protocol elements. This document is not meant to provide normative instruction to protocol designers, but does hope to provide guidance on common issues arising from this task. This initial draft does not contain real-world examples for the different strategies outlined below; before final publication, the IAB plans to add such examples and solicits feedback from the community on examples appropriate to this draft. Feedback on this point or the draft as a whole should be sent to the editors or the IAB.</t>
