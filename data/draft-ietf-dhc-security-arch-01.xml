      <t>This document addresses the general security requirements of both v4 and v6 versions of DHCP. This document lists security requirements and proposes as security model, which meets scaling requirements, security requirements and efficiency requirements. The proposed security model uses public key cryptography and a proposed trusted key distribution mechanism to authenticate clients and servers. The authentication protocol can also exchange keying material for more efficiently protecting successive communication between client and server. The security model also addresses securing relay agents.</t>
