      <t>This draft is an attempt to outline a 'technique' (I hesitate to call it a protocol) to adapt a transport protocol to application needs, outside the protocol payload, without interfering with the transport protocol operation, nor directly affecting its implementation. It is based on an 'interposer' header between the IP header and the transport header (TCP or UDP) and, when needed, a trailer that that is appended to the transport PDU.</t>
