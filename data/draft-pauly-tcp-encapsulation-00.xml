      <t>Network protocols other than TCP, such as UDP, are often blocked or suboptimally handled by network middleboxes. One strategy that applications can use to continue to send non-TCP traffic on such networks is to encapsulate datagrams or messages within in a TCP stream. However, encapsulating datagrams within TCP streams can lead to performance degradation. This document provides guidelines for how to use TCP for encapsulation, a summary of performance concerns, and some suggested mitigations for these concerns.</t>
