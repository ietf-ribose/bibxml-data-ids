      <t>This document describes a human-readable, textual syntax for representing self-describing structured data. This representation was designed as a transfer syntax for loosely-coupled distributed applications where one cannot depend on sender(s) and receiver(s) sharing a schema for exchanged data. The syntax is compact, expressive, intuitive, and simple to implement.</t>
