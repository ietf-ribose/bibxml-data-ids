      <t>Secure denial of the existence of wildcards may lead to a largenumber of NXT Resource Records and associated SIG Resource Records inDNS responses, even in the common case when wildcards are not presentin the zone. This optimization uses one bit from the NXT type arrayto signal that there is no closer wildcard in the zone for a givenquery name. This reduces the packet size and the need for executingslow, and complicated, code paths in the case when queries are madeto zones which have the bit set at zone signing time. In cases wherethere are no wildcard RRs in the zone (e.g. the root zone) only oneNXT RR and corresponding SIG is needed for denial of existence ofboth a full match and any possible wildcard matches.</t>
