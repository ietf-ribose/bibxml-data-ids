      <t>Secure denial of the existence of wildcards may lead to a large number of NXT Resource Records and associated SIG Resource Records in DNS responses, even in the common case when wildcards are not present in the zone. This optimization uses one bit from the NXT type array to signal that there is no closer wildcard in the zone for a given query name. This reduces the packet size and the need for executing slow, and complicated, code paths in the case when queries are made to zones which have the bit set at zone signing time. In cases where there are no wildcard RRs in the zone (e.g. the root zone) only one NXT RR and corresponding SIG is needed for denial of existence of both a full match and any possible wildcard matches.</t>
