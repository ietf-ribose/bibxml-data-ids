      <t>Multicast technology will become increasingly important with thedissemination of new applications such as contents delivery servicesand video conferences, which require much more bandwidth and stricterQoS than conventional applications. From the service providers'perspective, traffic engineering (TE) functions will be needed tohandle the large amount of multicast traffic.This document defines some protocol extensions to the existing RSVP-TE[1] in order to establish a multicast label switched path (LSP).The use of label switching routers (LSRs) with these protocolextensions defined in this document allows service providers to offerunicast and multicast multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) servicesin the same service network.This protocol assumes a variable LSP topology, e.g., point-to-multipoint, multipoint-to-multipoint, topologies. This documentdescribes how to establish point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-multipoint LSPs as the most basic multicast topology. It defines twoways of constructing a point-to-multipoint LSP: sender-initiated LSPsetup and leaf-initiated LSP setup. Each method has an LSPmodification function in order to adapt to dynamic changes in the LSPtree topology.This MPLS architecture[10] is very flexible and can be expanded tocarry protocols other than IP multicasting, e.g., Ethernet, PPP, andSONET/SDH, but this document only defines IP multicasting (IPv4 andIPv6) as a forwarding equivalence class object (FEC).</t>
