    <abstract>
      <t>While autonomic functions are often pre-installed and integrated with the network elements they manage, this is not a mandatory condition. Allowing autonomic functions to be dynamically installed and to control resources remotely enables more versatile deployment approaches and enlarges the application scope to virtually any legacy equipment. The analysis of autonomic functions deployment schemes through the installation, instantiation and operation phases allows constructing a unified life-cycle and identifying new required functionality. Thus, the introduction of autonomic technologies will be facilitated, the adoption much more rapid and broad. Operators will benefit from multi-vendor, interoperable autonomic functions with homogeneous operations and superior quality, and will have more freedom in their deployment scenarios.</t>
