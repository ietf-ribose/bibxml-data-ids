      <t>Today, networked applications typically make use of name-orientednetwork abstractions. There is a myriad of application developmentframeworks who provide abstracted APIs allowing applications to referto their peers by name. These abstractions normally only provideapplication-layer protocol functionality. They are normally uni-lateral solutions, the support for the protocol used is implied bythe service accessed on the remote peer(s).We suggest a unified API for networked applications. Isomorphic tothe existing name-based solutions, but with added network-relatedfunctionality. Providing an existing application-layer protocolswith network features such as mobility, multi-homing, IPv4/IPv6interoperability, NAT-traversal and so on...</t>
