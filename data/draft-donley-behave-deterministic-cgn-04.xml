    <abstract>
      <t>Abuse response in a Carrier Grade NAT environment requires Service Providers to be able to map a subscriber's inside address with the address used on the public Internet. Unfortunately, many Carrier Grade NAT abuse-response solutions require per-connection logging. Research indicates that such logging is not scalable to many residential broadband services. This document suggests a way to manage Carrier Grade NAT translations in such a way as to significantly reduce the amount of logging required while providing traceability for abuse response. While the authors acknowledge that IPv6 is a preferred solution, Carrier Grade NAT is a reality in many networks, and is needed in situations where either customer equipment or Internet content only supports IPv4; this approach should in no way slow the deployment of IPv6.</t>
