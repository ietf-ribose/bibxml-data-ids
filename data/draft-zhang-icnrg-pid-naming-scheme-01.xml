    <abstract>
      <t>In Information-centric network (ICN), everything is an identifiable object with a name such as a named data chunk. Different from host- centric connectivity, ICN connects named entities using name-based routing and forwarding. At the same time, network entities, end devices, and applications have variant demands to verify the integrity, authenticity, and validation of these entities through names. This document proposes a generic naming schema, called PID, which supports security provenance, content lookup, routing, and inter-domain resolution for ICN. With PID schema, a name consists of three components: principal(s), identifier(s), and domain(s). In this draft, we only illustrate the principles and concepts of PID and the functional role of each component, and leave encoding approaches as implementation options.</t>
