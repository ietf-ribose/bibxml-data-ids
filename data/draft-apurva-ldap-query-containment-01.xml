      <t>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directories are being used at the backend of many internet and intranet applications. LDAP servers that cache entries which are returned as search results (queries) for recently evaluated search requests, can use the semantic information associated with these requests, to answer subsequent search requests which are contained in them. This document describes LDAP schema for representing the semantic information and for supporting query containment of LDAP queries.</t>
