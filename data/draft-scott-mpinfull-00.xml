      <t>In this document, the M-PIN FULL protocol for two factor authentication and key exchange is described. This protocol mutually identifies a Client to a Server and the Server to the Client, and agrees between them a cryptographic strong encryption key for subsequent communication. M-PIN FULL requires an external Trusted Authority to issue secrets to participating Clients and Servers.</t>
