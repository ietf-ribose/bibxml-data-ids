      <t>Service Providers commonly use BGP/MPLS VPNs [RFC 4364] as the technology for providing wide-area virtual private network services. This technology has proven to scale to a very large number of VPNs and attachment points, and it is well suited for extending VPN connectivity to end-systems operating in a multi- tenant environments.
