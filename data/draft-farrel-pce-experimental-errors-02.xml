    <abstract>
      <t>Experimental RFCs are often considered beneficial approaches to developing new protocol features. To that end, sub-ranges of code point registries are often designated as for experimental use. IANA assigns values to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) parameters (messages, objects, TLVs). According to RFC 5440 as updated by RFC 8356, the allocation policies for the registries for PCEP messages, objects, and TLV types are IETF Review with some sub-ranges of these registries being assigned for Experimental Use. However, the registry of PCEP Error-Types and Error-values has only the IETF Review assignment policy meaning that experimentation is somewhat limited. This document updates RFC 5440 by designating a range of PCEP Error- Types for Experimental Use.</t>
