      <t>This document reviews common Internet protocols and discusses how each protocol establishes, maintains, and tears down trust relationships within the protocol. This document includes discussion of "meta" trust issues, including extra-protocol trust creation, management, and destruction. In cases where specific issues related to establishment of trust have been documented, these are discussed as well. By examining both similarities and differences between different protocols, this document can help protocol designers and maintainers in IETF working groups learn from successful (and un- successful) Internet protocols.</t>
