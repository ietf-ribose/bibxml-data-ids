      <t>This document specifies an automatic tunneling mechanism tailored for residual deployment of public IPv4 via IPv6 networks (the reverse of 6rd whose purpose is rapid deployment of IPv6 via IPv4). In order to deal with the IPv4-address shortage, customers can be assigned shared IPv4 addresses with statically assigned restricted port sets. Operation is stateless, with neither per-connection nor per-customer state needed in network nodes.</t>
