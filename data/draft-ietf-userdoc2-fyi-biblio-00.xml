      <t>This bibliography offers a list of recent publications which summarize the Internet, including its associated networks, resources, protocols, and history. This FYI RFC includes references to free sources of information available on-line as well as traditional publications. The books and on-line sources are designed as a starting point, rather than as a comprehensive list of all materials about the Internet. The emphasis is on recently printed books (1991-94), many of which are excellent overviews of the Internet. The list includes references to both introductory and more advanced materials. It is intended to compliment FYI 19 which is a short bibliography primarily designed for novice network users.</t>
