      <t>Service Function Chaining (SFC) is the process of directing packets through a network so that they can be acted on by an ordered set of abstract service functions before being delivered to the intended destination. An architecture for SFC is defined in RFC7665. The Network Service Header (NSH) can be inserted into packets to steer them along a specific path to realize a Service Function Chain. Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a widely deployed forwarding technology that uses labels to identify the forwarding actions to be taken at each hop through a network. Segment Routing is a mechanism that provides a source routing paradigm for steering packets in an MPLS network. This document describes how Service Function Chaining can be achieved in an MPLS network by means of a logical representation of the NSH in an MPLS label stack.</t>
