      <t>Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture leverages the source routing paradigm. A node steers a packet through a controlled set of instructions, called segments, by prepending the packet with SPRING header. A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service-based. A segment can have a local semantic to the SPRING node or global within the SPRING domain. SPRING allows to enforce a flow through any topological path while maintaining per- flow state only at the ingress node to the SPRING domain. The objective of this document is to illustrate some use cases that need to be taken into account by the Source Packet Routing in Networking (SPRING) architecture.</t>
