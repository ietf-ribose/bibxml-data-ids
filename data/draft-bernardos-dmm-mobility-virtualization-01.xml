    <abstract>
      <t>Mobility is no longer restricted to physical end systems roaming among radio points of attachment. Current mobile network deployments do not only consider the traditional client-server model, but also include scenarios in which services are decomposed into functions that run on virtualized resources, thus becoming virtual functions. This opens the door for new scenarios in which mobility now includes: (i) the end-system mobility (traditional scenario), (ii) a physical resource hosting a virtual function (part of a service being consumed by a end-system) moving, and (iii) a virtual function part of a service moving (migrating) to a different physical resource. As these scenarios are expected to be more commonly deployed in the short future, this documents aims at presenting the new mobility- related scenarios and the potential gaps in terms of IETF protocols.</t>
