      <t>This document identifies (OR BETTER: specifies) protocol enhancementsthat enable mobile nodes to more quickly become connected at newpoints of attachment to the Internet. These protocol enhancementsare intended to minimize the time during which the mobile node isunable to send or receive IPv6 packets (i.e., the handover latency).Mobile IPv6 is considered to be the base protocol, but MobileIPv6 does not mandate any mechanism which gives assurances aboutminimizing the handover latency. The protocol enhancements in thisdocument should be considered as protocol enhancements to MobileIPv6.</t>
