      <t>The DCLASS object is proposed in [DCLASS] to represent and carry Diffrentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs) within RSVP messages. The principle use of the DCLASS object is to carry DSCP information between a DS network and upstream nodes that may wish to mark packets with DSCP values. A network element in the DS network determines the value for DSCP which is further carried as a DCLASS object in RSVP RESV message to the sender host.</t>
