      <t>Service Function Chain (SFC) defines an ordered set of service functions (SFs) to be applied to packets and/or frames and/or flows selected as a result of classification. SFC Operation, Administration and Maintenance can monitor the continuity of the SFC, i.e., that all elements of the SFC are reachable to each other in the downstream direction. But SFC OAM must support verification that the order of traversing these SFs corresponds to the state defined by the SFC control plane or orchestrator, the metric referred in this document as the path consistency of the SFC. This document defines a new SFC active OAM method to support SFC consistency check, i.e. verification that all elements of the given SFC are being traversed in the expected order.</t>
