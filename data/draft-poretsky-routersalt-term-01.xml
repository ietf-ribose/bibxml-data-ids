    <abstract>
      <t>This terminology document provides the terms to be used for benchmarking router software under accelerated stress conditions. A framework is defined to configure routing protocols, security policies, traffic forwarding, and management. Conditions to produce instability and accelerate operational conditions are also defined. Benchmarks for evaluating a router subjected to the accelerated life test are introduced. The DUT configuration and accelerated stress conditions emulate those of Internet Core routers.</t>
