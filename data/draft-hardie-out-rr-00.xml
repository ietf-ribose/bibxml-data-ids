      <t>The Domain Name System is a global distributed lookup system with delegation. In the original specification of the DNS [RFC 1035], CLASSes were described as parallel data structures within a single namespace but with potentially different delegations of authority. [BCP 42] defines a different vision, in which different CLASSes represent fundamentally different namespaces. Though [BCP 42] includes procedures for assignment of CLASSes, there has been little use of this axis of extensibility; in practice, CLASS IN is the only widely deployed CLASS in the DNS. The ubiquity of CLASS IN for name to IP address mapping has caused a vicious cycle in which extensions are placed within that CLASS to take advantage of its global deployment, with each addition further increasing its gravitational attraction. This document describes a Resource Record for use within CLASS IN that contains a pointer to a CLASS outside of IN. This mechanism is intended to allow administrators to indicate that a named resource identified within CLASS IN is also present in a different namespace, potentially under a different name. This cross-class pointer will allow the DNS to handle new namespaces with mechanisms appropriate to those namespaces while providing a connection to the globally deployed CLASS IN namespace.</t>
