      <t>This document describes an LDAP [RFC4511] schema for implementing theKerberos 5 [RFC4120] KDC Information Model[I-D.ietf-krb-wg-kdc-model]. It also defines additional elementswhich are not covered by the Information Model, but are already incommon use.1. Background and MotivationBoth Kerberos and LDAP are frequently used separately for distributedauthentication. They can also be used in combination, but typicallytheir user databases remained separate. This distinction indatabases causes unnecessary duplication of data and administrationoverhead. As such it is desirable for both systems to share a singledatabase. Since the LDAP data model is more general it is mostappropriate to store the Kerberos data in LDAP.A number of Kerberos implementations already have support for usingLDAP as their KDC backing store. However, each implementation usesits own schema, and the multiple schemas are mutually incompatible.For the sake of interoperability and administrative ease, it isimportant to define a single standard schema that can be useduniformly by all Kerberos KDC implementations and interoperates withexisting LDAP specifications.2.
