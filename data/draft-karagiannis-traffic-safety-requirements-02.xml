      <t>This document describes a number of communication performance requirements that are imposed by traffic safety applications on a network layer. These traffic safety applications and requirements have been derived by the USA VSC (Vehicle Safety Communications)and VSC-A (VSC-Applications) projects and by the European Car to Car Communication Consortium (C2C-CC) and the ETSI TC ITS standardization body. The goal of this document is to stimulate the discussion on judging whether these performance requirements could or could not be supported (currently and in the future) by IP based network solutions.</t>
