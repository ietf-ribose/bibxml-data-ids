      <t>This memorandum discusses the issues and options involved in the design of a new transport protocol for multiplexed voice within a single packet. The intended application is the interconnection of devices which provide trunking or long distance telephone service over the Internet. Such devices have many voice connections simultaneously between them. Multiplexing them into the same connection improves on the efficiency, enables the use of low bitrate voice codecs, and improves scalability. Options and issues con- cerning timestamping, payload type identification, length indication, and channel identification are discussed. Sev- eral possible header formats are identified, and their efficiencies are compared.</t>
