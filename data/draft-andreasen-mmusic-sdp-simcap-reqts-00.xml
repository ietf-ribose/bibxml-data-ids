      <t>This document presents a set of requirements for defining Session Description Protocol (SDP) attributes that will allow SDP to provide a minimal and backwards compatible capability negotiation mechanism. The mechanism is intended as a simple and limited solution to the general capability negotiation problem being addressed by ongoing work on the next generation of SDP, also known as SDPng.</t>
