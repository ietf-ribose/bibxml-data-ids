      <t>IEEE 802.1 has developed standards as part of its Data Center Bridging (DCB) activity to (1) efficiently minimize data loss due to queue overflow for selected classes of traffic within Local Area Networks (LANs) meeting certain conditions and (2) provide means to allocate the available bandwidth on links to different classes of traffic. These standards were adopted as the IEEE 802.1Qbb, 802.1Qaz, and 802.1Qau amendmenst to the 802.1Q standard. This document briefly explains the standards and discusses the support of these IEEE 802 standards in RBridges (devices that implement the IETF TRILL standard).</t>
