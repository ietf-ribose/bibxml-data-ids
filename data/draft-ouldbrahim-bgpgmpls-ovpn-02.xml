      <t>Consider a service provider network that offers Optical/TDM Virtual Private Network service. An important goal of such service is the ability to support what is known as 'single end provisioning', where addition of a new port to a given Optical/TDM VPN would involve configuration changes only on the devices connected to that port. Another important goal in the Optical/TDM VPN service is the ability to establish/terminate an optical connection between a pair of (existing) ports within an Optical/TDM VPN without involving configuration changes in any of the provider devices.</t>
