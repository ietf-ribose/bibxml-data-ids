      <t>In this paper we study the problem of call model integration. Several call models are in common use. Most are customized for efficiency of operation and ease of access to features within specific domains. Access to features external to a given domain may be facilitated by overlaying the call model representation intrinsic to said external domain atop the base call model integral to the pre-specified base domain.</t>
