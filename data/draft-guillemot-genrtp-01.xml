      <t>This document describes a payload format, which can be used for thetransport of both MPEG-4 Elementary Streams (ES) as well as MPEG-4Sync Layer packet streams, in RTP [1] packets. The payload formatallows for protection against loss in a generic way, through frag-mentation, grouping and extension data mechanisms, which can dynamically adapt to network conditions. These mechanisms can operate bothon full and partial MPEG-4 Access Units, such as Sync Layer packets,or typed segments, These mechanisms can cover a broad range ofprotection schemes and avoid extra connection management complexity- e.g. for separate FEC channels - in MPEG-4 applications with a high number of streams.</t>
