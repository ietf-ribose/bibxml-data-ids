      <t>The DTNRG research group has defined many protocols such as BundleProtocol and Licklider. The specifications of these protocolscontain fields that are subject to a registry. For the purpose ofits research work, the group created adhoc registries[DTNRGREG]. Asthe specifications are stable and have multiple interoperableimplementations, the group would like to handoff the registries toIANA for official custidy.
