      <t>This document specifies the problem of attack on authenticity users. The problem is discussed with respect to fog computing environment. The threat exist when any user log in to access the service. The two aspects are either the fog server is fake or the user node is fake. The information stored on the server and transferred over the connection. This information can be highly confidential and sensitive. So to enhance security in this scenario, cloud server can authenticate both the parties and establish the connection. There are chances that it can get attacked and used by illegitimate users. Therefore, there was an utmost need to increase the security on authentication of the users. This document discusses a novel approach to overcome the problem by using a hybrid approach. The technique is based on user authentication and fog authentication by cloud server.</t>
