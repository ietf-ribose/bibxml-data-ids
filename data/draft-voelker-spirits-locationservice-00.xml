      <t>SPIRITS services are those originating in the PSTN and involving interactions between the PSTN and the Internet. This document describes how SPIRITS supports those aspects of location services whereby the PSTN wireless network provides location related events to internet applications requesting them. An example of such an event is a mobile station entering a pre-specified geographic zone.</t>
