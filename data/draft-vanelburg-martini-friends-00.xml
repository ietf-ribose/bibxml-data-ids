      <t>The Martini Working Group is defining a mechanism for SIP IP-PBX typedevices to REGISTER and obtain SIP service for E.164-based Address ofRecords. In doing so it has selected a solution that is notcompatible with the solution that was specified in ETSI TISPAN and3GPP for subscription based business trunking. The latter solutionnot only covers E.164 numbers but also handles non-E.164 numbers andalphanumeric AOR's.This document defines a extension of the martini mechanism thatallows it to be used also with ETSI TISPAN and 3GPP standardsubscription based business trunking arrangements.</t>
