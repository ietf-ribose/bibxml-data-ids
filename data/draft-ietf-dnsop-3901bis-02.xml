      <t>This memo provides guidelines and documents Best Current Practice for operating authoritative DNS servers as well as recursive and stub DNS resolvers, given that queries and responses are carried in a mixed environment of IPv4 and IPv6 networks. This document expands on RFC 3901 by recommending that authoritative DNS servers as well as recursive DNS resolvers support both IPv4 and IPv6. It furthermore provides guidance on recursive DNS resolver selection for stub DNS resolvers. This document obsoletes RFC3901. (if approved)</t>
