      <t>This memo defines two new Instance Identifiers (Instance IDs) in OSPFv3 [RFC2740]). These new Instance IDs [I-D.ietf-ospf-af-alt] are meant to instantiate distinct OSPFv3 instances to convey routing information which is specific to IPv4-mapped IPv6 address Address Family [I-D.ietf-behave-address-format]. The goal of running separate instances for IPv4-mapped IPv6 is to distinguish the native IPv6 routing topology from the IPv4 routing topology. Separate instances are also meant to prevent any overload of the native IPv6 routing tables by IPv4-mapped IPv6 routes. This isolation is motivated also from an operational perspective to enforce specific routing policies for each topology.</t>
