      <t>This document specifies Proof of Process (PoP), an evidence framework for digital authorship attestation. The framework produces tamper- evident, independently verifiable process evidence describing how documents evolve over time, without capturing document content or keystroke data. Proof of Process implements a specialized profile of the Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) architecture, extending it with behavioral entropy bindings, Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) temporal proofs, and a taxonomy of absence claims with explicit trust requirements. The specification defines two complementary CBOR- encoded formats: Evidence Packets (.pop) produced by Attesters during document authorship, and Attestation Results (.war) produced by Verifiers after appraising Evidence. The framework is designed around four core principles: privacy by construction (no content storage), zero trust (locally generated, independently verifiable), evidence over inference (observable facts, not conclusions), and cost-asymmetric forgery (expensive to fake, not impossible). This specification does not address AI detection, stylometric analysis, or intent inference.</t>
