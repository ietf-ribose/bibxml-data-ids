    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a profile for the Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) framework. The profile uses Group Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (Group OSCORE) to provide communication security between a client and one or multiple resource servers that are members of an OSCORE group. The profile securely binds an OAuth 2.0 access token to the public key of the client associated with the private key used by that client in the OSCORE group. The profile uses Group OSCORE to achieve server authentication, as well as proof-of-possession for the client's public key. Also, it provides proof of the client's membership to the OSCORE group by binding the access token to information from the Group OSCORE Security Context, thus allowing the resource server(s) to verify the client's membership upon receiving a message protected with Group OSCORE from the client. Effectively, the profile enables fine-grained access control paired with secure group communication, in accordance with the Zero Trust principles.</t>
