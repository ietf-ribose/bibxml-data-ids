      <t>A package is a logical entity that holds a collection of parts. Given the URI for a complete package, the "pack" URI scheme provides for the construction and use of URIs referring to individual parts within the package. It also provides for the use of part's URIs as base URIs for resolving relative references between the parts in a single package.</t>
