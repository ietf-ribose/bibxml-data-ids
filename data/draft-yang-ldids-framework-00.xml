      <t>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are designed to detect intrusions and protect the relative network or hosts. Now the network scale is becoming larger and larger, Large-scale Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems, which are IDSs that workin such environments, are the trends of IDSs evolution. This document describes a hierarchy framework for Large-scale Distributed Intrusion Detection Systems, with which a Large-scaleDistributed IDS can be flexibly deployed. Each node in this framework can be seen as a simple IDS. This document gives a four-layer structure for the simple IDS. This four-layer structurecan also be the structure of an independent IDS.</t>
