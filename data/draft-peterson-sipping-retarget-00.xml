      <t>Retargeting, the alteration by intermediaries of the destination of a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) request, is a common practice performed during the routing of a call. Some forms of retargeting, however, give rise to security problems and potential functional gaps in SIP. This document provides a general framework for discussion of the security problems relating to retargeting, and gives requirements for mechanisms that might overcome these problems.</t>
