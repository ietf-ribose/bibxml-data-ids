    <abstract>
      <t>Source address spoofing remains a significant challenge in today's Internet. Although source address validation (SAV) mechanisms, such as ingress filtering [RFC2827], unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF) [RFC3704], and the Enhanced Feasible-Path Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (EFP-uRPF) [RFC8704], have been proposed for a long time, some ASes have not deployed SAV due to the problems of existing SAV mechanism, such as inaccurate validation, misaligned incentive, or other overhead concerns. This document specifically explains the misaligned incentive problem of existing SAV mechanisms and clarifies the direct incentive that a new SAV mechanism should achieve.</t>
