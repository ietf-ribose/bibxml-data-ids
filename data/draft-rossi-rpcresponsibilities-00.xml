      <t>This document updates RFC 9280 to specify that the RPC is responsible for operational decisions needed to implement RFC Series policies as they pertain to the document publication process code and tools, and provides a pathway for resolution of disagreements with those operational decisions. This document also updates RFC9280 to acknowledge that RFC Consumers, a distinct but partially overlapping group with IETF participants, must be specifically considered in the process of writing and implementing RFC Series policies, and makes the RPC responsible for representing their interests. Additionally, this document updates language in RFC7990, RFC7991, RFC7992, RFC7993, RFC7994, RFC7995, RFC7996, and RFC7997 to transfer responsibilities previously held by the RFC Editor or RFC Series Editor to the RPC.</t>
