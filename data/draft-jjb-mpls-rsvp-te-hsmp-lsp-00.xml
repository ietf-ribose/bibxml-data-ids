      <t>In Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)environment, the RSVP-TE based Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) LSP allowstraffic to transmit from root to leaf node, but there is no co-routedreverse path for traffic from leaf to root node. This draftintroduces a Hub and Spoke Multipoint (HSMP) LSP, which allowstraffic from both the root to the leaves through a P2MP LSP and alsothe leaves to the root along a co-routed reverse path.</t>
