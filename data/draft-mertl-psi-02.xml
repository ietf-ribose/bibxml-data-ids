      <t>This memo describes a protocol that builds upon UDP/IP to transport illumination and control data for stage, architectural and other illumination requirements. It may be understood as a spiritual successor of the traditional DMX (Digital MultipleX) specification series, removing it's limitations and adding flexibility and usability enhancements like auto-discovery and metadata, among other useful features.</t>
