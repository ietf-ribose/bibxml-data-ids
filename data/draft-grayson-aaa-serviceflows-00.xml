      <t>This document specifies a Diameter authorization extension that is used for the delivery of Service-Flow Charging Rules. These Service-FlowCharging Rules identify service flows that can be used within a credit control environment for distinguishing individual packet flows for which credit control applies. Multiple Service-Flows can be provided which then enable independent rating of the individual packet flows. Service-Flows can be provided at authentication and may be dynamically updated throughout the lifetime of an AAA session.</t>
