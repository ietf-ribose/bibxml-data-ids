    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a mechanism that provides Mobile IP nodes and agents with the necessary keys and information needed to establish mobility security associations within a foreign network. This mechanism aims at reducing the latency and computational burden introduced by public-key based key management protocols in network topologies where visiting mobile nodes register with their respective home agents several times through different foreign agents requiring Mobile-Foreign Authentication. This mechanism employs a key distribution center capable of generating the security contexts needed to authenticate Mobile IP control messages. This mechanism, designed as an extension to the Mobile IP protocol, preservs backward compatibility and interoperability with RFC2002 compliant implementations of Mobile IP.</t>
