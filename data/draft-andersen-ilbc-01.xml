      <t>This document specifies a speech codec suitable for robust voice communication over IP. The codec is developed by Global IP Sound (GIPS) and is designed for narrow band speech and results in a payload bit rate of 13.867 kbit/s with an encoding frame length of 30 ms. The codec enables graceful speech quality degradation in the case of lost frames, which occurs in connection with lost or delayed IP packets.</t>
