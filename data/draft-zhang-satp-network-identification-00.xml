    <abstract>
      <t>There is currently a lack of a standard network identification or numbering for digital asset networks. This deficiency makes it difficult for the transfer of digital assets from one network to another, due among others, to the possibility in the collision in the numbering of the remote networks. This document proposes a globally unique 32-byte identifier for each asset network based on some unique inherent characteristics of each network.</t>
