      <t>The Internet Integrated Services (IIS) architecture[2] has a fundamental scaling problem in that per flow state is maintained at all routers and end-systems supporting a flow. This paper examines the use of aggregation as a technique to reduce the amount of state needed to provide IIS. In our approach, routers at the edge of a region doing aggregation keep detailed IIS state, while in the interior of this region, routers keep a greatly reduced amount of state. Packets will be tagged at the edge with scheduling information that will be used in place of the detailed IIS state. The aggregation scheme described will allow large scale deployment of IIS without overloading routers with state and associated processing.</t>
