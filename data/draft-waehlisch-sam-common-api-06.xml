      <t>Group communication services exist in a large variety of flavors, andtechnical implementations at different protocol layers. Multicastdata distribution is most efficiently performed on the lowestavailable layer, but a heterogeneous deployment status of multicasttechnologies throughout the Internet requires an adaptive servicebinding at runtime. Today, it is difficult to write an applicationthat runs everywhere and at the same time makes use of the mostefficient multicast service available in the network. Facingrobustness requirements, developers are frequently forced to using astable, upper layer protocol controlled by the application itself.This document describes a common multicast API that is suitable fortransparent communication in underlay and overlay, and grants accessto the different multicast flavors. It proposes an abstract namingby multicast URIs and discusses mapping mechanisms between differentnamespaces and distribution technologies. Additionally, it describesthe application of this API for building gateways that interconnectcurrent multicast domains throughout the Internet.</t>
