      <t>This document describes a Dynamic Mesh-based overlay MulticastProtocol (DMMP) framework to support multicast data deliveryapplications without relying on classic IP multicast, includingmulticast group management, overlay hierarchy establishment,multicast tree construction and data forwarding scheme from a sourceto a number of receivers. The DMMP framework builds on control planefunctions which dynamically manage an overlay core and a multicasttree. The key idea is a number of end hosts self-organize into anoverlay mesh, and dynamically maintain such a mesh. Based on theconstructed mesh, some core-based clusters are formed with capacity-aware trees inside. Then, a multicast tree consisting of DMMP-awareend hosts (and/or specific routers) is built on the top of theoverlay core for the efficient delivery of the multicast data.</t>
