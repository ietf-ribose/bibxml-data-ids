      <t>Currently, TRILL solution can only provide optimum unicast forwarding just for Layer2 traffic of intra-subnet forwarding, not for Layer3 traffic(inter-subnet forwarding). In this document, a TRILL Integrated Routing and Bridging (IRB) solution is introduced to provide optimum unicast forwarding not just for Layer 2 traffic (intra-subnet forwarding), but also for Layer 3 traffic (inter- subnet forwarding). In the TRILL IRB scenario, an edge RB MUST perform the bridging function for the End Systems that are on the same subnet and the IP routing for the End Systems that are on the different subnets of same tenant.</t>
