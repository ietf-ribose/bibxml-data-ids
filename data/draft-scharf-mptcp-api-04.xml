      <t>Multipath TCP (MPTCP) adds the capability of using multiple paths toa regular TCP session. Even though it is designed to be totallybackward compatible to applications, the data transport differscompared to regular TCP, and there are several additional degrees offreedom that applications may wish to exploit. This documentsummarizes the impact that MPTCP may have on applications, such aschanges in performance. Furthermore, it discusses compatibilityissues of MPTCP in combination with non-MPTCP-aware applications.Finally, the document describes a basic application interface forMPTCP-aware applications that provides access to multipath addressinformation and a level of control equivalent to regular TCP.</t>
