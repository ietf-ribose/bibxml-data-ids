      <t>Web servers and the entities that operate them have long had theability to track user agents as they access resources hosted acrossdifferent web domains. Concern over the privacy implications of suchtracking has prompted recent work on a number of solutions that aimto provide a universal opt-out mechanism for web tracking that can beeffectuated through a simple binary choice presented to users.This document provides an overview of the following mechanisms:permanent opt-out cookies, cookie blocking, domain blocking, a "DoNot Track" (DNT) HTTP header, and a Do Not Track Document ObjectModel (DOM) property. The aim of this document is to describe eachapproach, the pros and cons of each, and areas where standardizationmay be necessary should each approach be further pursued, withoutmaking recommendations about which approach or approaches should beadopted.</t>
