    <abstract>
      <t>JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) and CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) are two widely used security wrappers, which have been developed in the IETF and have intentionally been kept in sync. This document provides guidance for protocol designers developing extensions for JOSE/COSE and for implementers of JOSE/COSE libraries. Developers of application using JSON and/or JOSE should also read this document but are realistically more focused on the documentation offered by the library they are using.</t>
