      <t>This memo proposes a protocol that allows a domain name owner to delegate to a third party (such as a CDN) control over a certificate that bears one or more names in that domain. Specifically the third party creates a Certificate Signing Request for the domain, which can then be used by the domain owner to request a short term and automatically renewed (STAR) certificate. This is a component in a solution where a third-party such as a CDN can terminate TLS sessions on behalf of a domain name owner (e.g., a content provider), and the domain owner can cancel this delegation at any time without having to rely on certificate revocation mechanisms.</t>
