      <t>This draft proposes a general inter-domain multicast forwarding(IDMF) mechanism for the PIM-SM multicast routing protocol and itsapplication to the MSDP specific forwarding extension (MSDP-FE).Although there have been various inter-domain multicast routing andforwarding protocols, they are still limited in their capacity tohandle policy routing, QoS routing, accounting and security, whichnetwork administrators are willing to use in their network. In orderto overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach to create aninter-domain multicast forwarding tree (or routing table) amongmultiple PIM-SM domains with logical multicast paths over whichmulticast packets are forwarded or flooded. The logical multicastpaths are created by either the IP-in-IP tunneling method, the IPmasquerade-like method, or the MPLS label switched path (LSP) method,which can easily reuse policy routing and QoS routing for unicastrouting. These logical multicast paths are established among IDMF-capable nodes, which are located within each PIM-SM domain, eithermanually or by a dynamic IDMF tree construction protocol. Thisgeneral framework for IDMF can be used as an MSDP based forwardingmechanism. Furthermore, the IDMF-capable nodes (i.e., MSDP-FE-capablenodes) can also function as a proxy sender of multicast packets. Thiscan prevent a multicast receiver from changing an RP-tree into aglobal SP-tree, and also can help to reduce, on the surface, thenumber of multicast sources for a particular multicast group. Thisproperty can be effectively used for accounting, security, andscalability enhancement required for inter-domain communication.</t>
