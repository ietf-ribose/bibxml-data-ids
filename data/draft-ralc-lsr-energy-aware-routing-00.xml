    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes enhancements to the Segment Routing (SR) Flexible Algorithm (Flex-Algo) framework by integrating power consumption metrics into routing decisions. It introduces metrics encompassing both node-level and link-level energy consumption attributes and proposes dynamic energy-aware path computation. By incorporating these metrics alongside traditional routing parameters, the enhanced Flex-Algo framework can enable networks to optimize routing paths for energy efficiency, and then leverage on advances router capabilities to further reduce operational costs as well as supporting sustainability objectives.</t>
