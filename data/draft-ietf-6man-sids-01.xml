      <t>The data plane for Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) [RFC8754] is built using IPv6 as the underlying forwarding plane. Due to this underlying use of IPv6, Segment Identifiers (SIDs) used by SRv6 can resemble IPv6 addresses and behave like them [RFC8754][RFC8986] while exhibiting slightly different behaviors in some situations. This document intends to explore the characteristics of SRv6 SIDs and to clarify the relationship of SRv6 SIDs to the IPv6 Addressing Architecture [RFC4291].</t>
