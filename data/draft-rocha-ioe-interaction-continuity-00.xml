    <abstract>
      <t>Internet of Everything (IoE) deployments increasingly bind together devices, networks, cloud and edge compute, AI-assisted processing, and human participation within the same time-bounded operational interactions. When governance is externalized into multiple fragmented control contexts, the system must continuously propagate and reconcile identity, policy state, routing state, and compute placement decisions across those contexts, in real time. This document defines an architectural problem: as independently scaling dimensions multiply, coordination surfaces grow at multiplicative rates, making deterministic governance impractical. The draft enumerates requirements for interaction-scoped governance primitives that collapse fragmented control contexts.</t>
