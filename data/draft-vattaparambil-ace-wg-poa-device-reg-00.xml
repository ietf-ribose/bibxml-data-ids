    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes an extension to the ACE framework with the Power of Attorney (PoA) based authorization. This is proposed following the identification of mutual authorization problem between the client and the AS in the ACE framework, which demands secure registration of the client to the AS and a mechanism for the client to validate the AS. The proposed system adds a new entity referred as the Device Owner to the ACE framework that delegates the client device and provides information (in a PoA) regarding the AS to which the client is intended to communicate with.</t>
