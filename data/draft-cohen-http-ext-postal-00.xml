      <t>As time goes on, more and more groups are extending HTTP's functionality. In using HTTP, a decision is made to either use a new method name for new functionality or to overload an existing one such as POST. Our belief is that in most cases, overloading existing method names, with POST as a particularly troublesome example, is a bad idea. We, as a group of individuals, suggest that the default requirement for new HTTP functionality must be to create a new method name.</t>
