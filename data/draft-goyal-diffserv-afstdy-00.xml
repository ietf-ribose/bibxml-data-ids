      <t>One desirable characteristics of any resource allocation (ordifferentiation) mechanism is that if many aggregates, each with itsown reservation, are merged with other aggregates of the same class,each aggregate should get its reserved bandwidth and a fair share ofthe excess bandwidth. In particular, the performance of an aggregateshould not be adversely affected by other aggregates and theircongestion sensitivity. TCP flows are congestion sensitive while UDPflows are congestion insensitive in the sense that TCP flows reducetheir traffic if any packets are lost. The goal of this study is tosee if TCP flow aggregates will be punished for their good behaviorin the presence of competing UDP flow aggregates in the same assuredforwarding class. We identify several factors that affect theperformance in the mixed environments and quantify their effectsusing a full factorial design of experiment methodology.</t>
