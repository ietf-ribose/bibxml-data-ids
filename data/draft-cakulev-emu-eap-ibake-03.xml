      <t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is an authentication framework which supports multiple authentication methods. This document defines an authentication method for EAP called EAP-IBAKE, which is based on the Identity-Based Authenticated Key Exchange (IBAKE) protocol. The IBAKE method provides mutual authentication through the use of identity-based encryption. In addition to mutual authentication this method also provides perfect forward and backwards secrecy.</t>
