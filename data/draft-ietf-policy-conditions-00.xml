      <t>This document defines an information model for networking policy conditions as part of the general information model for representing networking policy defined in draft-ietf-policy-core-schema-02.txt. The information model described in this document is focussed on the structural class networkingPolicyCondition that extends the class policyCondition described draft-ietf-policy-core-schema-02.txt. Five auxiliary classes are defined to describe conditions that refer to (1) the communicating hosts, (2) the communicating users (3) application data (4) routing information at the device enforcing the policy and (5) layer 2 or data link layer information of the device. This document is based on the QoS and IPSec schema first described in [3] and [4].</t>
