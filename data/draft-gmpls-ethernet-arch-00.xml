      <t>There has been significant recent work in increasing the capabilitiesof Ethernet switches. As a consequence, the role of Ethernet israpidly expanding into "transport networks" that previously were thedomain of other technologies such as SONET/SDH TDM and ATM. Thisdocument defines an architecture and framework for a GMPLS basedcontrol plane for Ethernet in this "transport network" capacity.GMPLS has already been specified for similar technologies. Someadditional extensions to the GMPLS control plane are needed and thisdocument provides a framework for these extensions.Contents</t>
