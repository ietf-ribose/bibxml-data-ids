      <t>This memo describes an investigation of how some common mailers (Eudora, Pine, Hotmail, Outlook Express, Netscape, First Class, KOM 2000) handled the use of multipart/alternative with different languages in the different body parts. None of the mailers handled this very well. It seems as if none of the mailers can actually choose the part in the language preferred by the user. Some of them displayed all language parts, some arbitrarily chose to display only one part. The study compares different methods of specifying language translation in e-mail, but finds that no format seems to give satisfactory results with all the tested mailers.</t>
