      <t>This memo describes an investigation of how some common mailers(Eudora, Pine, Hotmail, Outlook Express, Netscape, First Class, KOM2000) handled the use of multipart/alternative with different languagesin the different body parts.None of the mailers handled this very well. It seems as if none of themailers can actually choose the part in the language preferred by theuser. Some of them displayed all language parts, some arbitrarily choseto display only one part.The study compares different methods of specifying language translationin e-mail, but finds that no format seems to give satisfactory resultswith all the tested mailers.</t>
