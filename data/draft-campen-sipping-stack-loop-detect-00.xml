      <t>This document defines a loop-detection algorithm with a cumulative O(n) complexity (O(1) average complexity for each proxy) and average O(log n) state-space, where n is the number of proxies that the message passes through. Also, the backwards-compatibility and security of this algorithm are discussed. Comments are solicited, and should be directed to the SIPPING working group list at 'sipping@ietf.org'.</t>
