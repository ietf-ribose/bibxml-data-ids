      <t>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) exhibit characteristics unlike other more traditional IP links. LLNs are a class of network in which both routers and their interconnect are resource constrained. LLN routers are typically resource constrained in processing power, memory, and energy (i.e. battery power). LLN links are typically exhibit high loss rates, low data rates, are are strongly affected by environmental conditions that change over time. LLNs may be composed of a few dozen to thousands of routers. A new protocol called the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) has been specified for routing in LLNs supporting multipoint-to-point, point- to-multipoint traffic, and point-to-point traffic. Since RPL's publication as an RFC, several large scale networks have been succesfully deployed. The aim of this document is to provide deployment experience on real-life deployed RPL-based networks.</t>
