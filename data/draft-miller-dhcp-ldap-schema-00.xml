    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a schema for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). This schema makes it possible to integrate DHCP servers with an LDAP-based directory service, allowing an organization to maintain a single store of IP addresses and other configuration data provided to clients using the DHCP protocol. Integration of DHCP into LDAP directories is desirable since it reduces administrative overhead and eliminates the need to maintain multiple server centric configuration databases. It is anticipated that this schema will be useful for providing a standardized format for the representation of attributes needed by DHCP implementations within LDAP-based directory services.</t>
