      <t>This document describes a mapping of IETF Integrated Services[3] over Diff-Serv Networks built from network elements having diff-serv defined Per Hop Behaviours (PHBs)[11]. In many ways, this document should look like an ISSLL document assuming that a differentiated service network looks like an instance of _media_ within a integrated services network. It describes parameter mappings for supporting Controlled Load [6] and Guaranteed Service [7] using the capabilities of diff-serv networks in routers and switches. These mappings fit within an overall Framework for Integrated and Differentiated Services[to be submitted].</t>
