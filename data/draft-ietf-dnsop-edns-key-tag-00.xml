      <t>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) were developed to provide origin authentication and integrity protection for DNS data by using digital signatures. These digital signatures can be verified by building a chain-of-trust starting from a trust anchor and proceeding down to a particular node in the DNS. This document specifies a way for validating end-system resolvers to signal to a server which keys are referenced in their chain-of-trust. The extensions allow zone administrators to monitor the progress of rollovers in a DNSSEC- signed zone.</t>
