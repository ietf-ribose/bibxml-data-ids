      <t>In TRILL active-active access scenario, RPF check failure issue may occur when pseudo-nickname mechanism in [RFC7781] is used. This draft describes a solution to resolve the RPF check failure issue through centralized replication. All ingress RBridges send BUM (Broadcast, Unknown unicast and Mutlicast) traffic to a centralized node with unicast TRILL encapsulation. When the centralized node receives the BUM traffic, it decapsulates the packets and forwards them to all destination RBridges using a distribution tree established as per TRILL base protocol[RFC6325]. To avoid RPF check failure on a RBridge sitting between the ingress RBridge and the centralized replication node, some change of RPF calculation algorithm is required. RPF calculation on each RBridge should use the centralized node as ingress RB instead of the real ingress RBridge which is denoted as RBv in [RFC7781] to perform the calculation.</t>
