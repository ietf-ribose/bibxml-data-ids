      <t>This document specifies an extension to the multicast addressing architecture of the IPv6 protocol. The extension allows for sing interface-ID to allocate multicast addresses. When the link-local unicast address is configured at each interface of host, interface ID is uniquely determined. By delegating multicast addresses at the same time as interface ID, each host can identify their multicast addresses automatically at Layer 1 without needing to run an intra- or inter-domain allocation protocol in the serverless environments.</t>
