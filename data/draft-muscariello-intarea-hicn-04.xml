      <t>This document describes the hybrid information-centric networking (hICN) architecture for IPv6. The specifications describe a way to implement information-networking functionalities into IPv6. The objective is to use IPv6 without creating overlays with a new packet format as an additional encapsulation. The intent of the present design is to introduce some IPv6 routers in the network with additional packet processing operations to implement ICN functions. Moreover, the current design is tightly integrated into IPv6 to allow easy interconnection to IPv6 networks with the additional design objective to exploit existing IPv6 protocols as much as possible as they are, or extend them where needed.</t>
