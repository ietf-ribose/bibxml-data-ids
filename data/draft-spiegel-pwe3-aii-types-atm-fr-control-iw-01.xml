      <t>This document describes work in progress in the MFA Forum on ATM andFrame Relay to MPLS Control Plane Interworking. Two specificationsare being defined, one for client-server interworking (between twoclient network endpoints that communicate across an IP/MPLS network)and one for SPVC interworking (from a client network endpoint to anIP/MPLS network endpoint). Both client-server interworking and SPVCInterworking use standard PWE3 control for establishment of thepseudowires that transport the ATM or Frame Relay data connectionsacross the IP/MPLS network. New AII type codepoints from the "ExpertReview" range are requested. The need for these codepoints andproposed usage is described.</t>
