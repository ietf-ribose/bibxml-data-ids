    <abstract>
      <t>Reducing technology's carbon footprint is one of the big challenges of our age. Networks are an enabler of applications that reduce this footprint, but also contribute to this footprint substantially themselves. The biggest opportunities to reduce the energy footprint may not be networking specific, for instance general power efficiency gains in hardware or hosting of equipment in more cooling-efficient buildings. Yet methods to make networking technology itself "greener" also need to be explored. This document outlines a corresponding set of opportunities, along with associated research challenges, for reducing this footprint and reducing network energy demand.</t>
