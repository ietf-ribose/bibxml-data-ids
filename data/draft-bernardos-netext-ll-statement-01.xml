      <t>The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) as [RFC5213].PMIPv6 enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roamacross gateways without changing the IP address. PMIPv6 alsoprovides limited multi-homing support to multi-mode mobile devices.Proxy mobility is based on the assumption that changes in host IPstacks are undesirable. Link layer implementations can hide theactually used physical interfaces from the IP stack. Thesetechniques can be used to achieve inter-access technology handoversor flow mobility, i.e., the movement of selected flows from oneaccess technology to another. It is assumed that an IP layerinterface can simultaneously and/or sequentially attach to multipleMAGs (possibly over multiple media). This document provides aninformational applicability statement that analyzes the issuesinvolved with this approach (i.e. hiding access technology changesfrom host IP layer) and characterizes the contexts in which such useis or is not appropriate to achieve inter-access handovers or flowmobility.</t>
