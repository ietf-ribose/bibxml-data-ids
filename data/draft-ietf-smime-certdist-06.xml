      <t>Current methods of publishing certificates in directory services are restricted to just certificates. This document provides a method of publishing certificates with secondary support information such as the SMimeCapabilities attribute (containing bulk algorithm support) in a way that is both authenticated and bound to a given certificate. This draft is being discussed on the 'ietf-smime' mailing list. To join the list, send a message to &lt;ietf-smime-request@imc.org&gt; with the single word 'subscribe' in the body of the message. Also, there is a Web site for the mailing list at &lt;http://www.imc.org/ietf- smime&gt;.</t>
