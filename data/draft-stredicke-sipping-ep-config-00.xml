      <t>Mass deployment of SIP compliant devices requires a simple mechanism for configuring and maintaining them. For the economical success of SIP based devices on a large scale, a platform independent mechanism for finding and exchanging the required information is vital. The goal of this draft is to reduce the amount of effort required for administrators to provision devices. This draft focuses on defining a common data set to configure SIP end points. The mechanism for providing and maintaining the configuration data to the end point is defined elsewhere [7].</t>
