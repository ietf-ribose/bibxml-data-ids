      <t>The IETF has standardized RBridges, devices that implement the TRILL protocol, a solution for transparent shortest-path frame routing in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies, using a link-state routing protocol technology and encapsulation with a hop-count. As RBridges are deployed in real-world situations, operators will need tools for debugging problems that arise. This document specifies a set of RBridge features for operations, administration, and maintenance purposes in RBridge campuses. The features specified in this document include tools for traceroute, ping, and error reporting.</t>
