      <t>The IETF has standardized RBridges, devices that implement the TRILLprotocol, a solution for transparent shortest-path frame routing inmulti-hop networks with arbitrary topologies, using a link-staterouting protocol technology and encapsulation with a hop-count. AsRBridges are deployed in real-world situations, operators will needtools for debugging problems that arise. This document specifies aset of RBridge features for operations, administration, andmaintenance purposes in RBridge campuses. The features specified inthis document include tools for traceroute, ping, and errorreporting.</t>
