      <t>Since IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are represented by different resource records in the DNS, operating systems capable of running both IPv4 and IPv6 need to make two queries when resolving a host name. This document discusses conditions, under which the stub resolver can optimize the process by not sending one of the queries if the host is connected to a single-stack network.</t>
