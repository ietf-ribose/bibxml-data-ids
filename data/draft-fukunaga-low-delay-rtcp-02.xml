      <t>Low delay feedback in RTP has gained a lot of interest recently inorder to enhance the performance in RTP sessions with two or only asmall number of participants. A recent document describes rules thatenhance the functionality of the existing RTP timing and allow lowdelay feedback. While that document describes when it is allowed tosend data, we describe here what kind of low delay feedback may besent. Therefore we define three general RTCP feedback message typesas well as some recommendations how the sender SHOULD react tocertain feedback. The message types can either be used as is or theycan be extended in payload or application specific ways.</t>
