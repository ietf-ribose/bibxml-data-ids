      <t>Low delay feedback in RTP has gained a lot of interest recently in order to enhance the performance in RTP sessions with two or only a small number of participants. A recent document describes rules that enhance the functionality of the existing RTP timing and allow low delay feedback. While that document describes when it is allowed to send data, we describe here what kind of low delay feedback may be sent. Therefore we define three general RTCP feedback message types as well as some recommendations how the sender SHOULD react to certain feedback. The message types can either be used as is or they can be extended in payload or application specific ways.</t>
