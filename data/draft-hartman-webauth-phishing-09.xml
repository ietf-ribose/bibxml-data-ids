      <t>This memo proposes requirements for protocols between web browsersand relying parties at websites; these requirements also impact thirdparties involved in the authentication process. These requirementsminimize the likelihood that criminals will be able to gain thecredentials necessary to impersonate a user or be able tofraudulently convince users to disclose personal information. Tomeet these requirements browsers must change. Websites must neverreceive information such as passwords that can be used to impersonatethe user to third parties. Browsers should authenticate the websiteto the browser as part of authenticating the user to the website.Browsers MUST flag situations when this authentication fails and flagsituations when the target website is not authorized to accept theidentity being offered as this is a strong indication of fraud.These requirements may serve as a basis for requirements forpreventing fraud in environments other than the web.</t>
