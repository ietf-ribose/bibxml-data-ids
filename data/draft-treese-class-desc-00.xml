      <t>Many applications for automated searching and selection of documents can benefit from a common notation for classifying documents. This memo describes one such notation. The notation is extensible to allow the description of many different properties on a given document. The notation can be employed by any application using RFC-822 headers, such as electronic mail and the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). In addition, we define a new error code for HTTP to indicate a selection failure.</t>
