    <abstract>
      <t>Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs) present an interesting challenge for IPv6 addressing due to the indeterminant neighborhood properties of MANET interfaces. IPv6 nodes must assign IPv6 addresses to their MANET interfaces that are both unique and routable within the MANET but must not be propagated to other networks. IPv6 nodes must therefore be able to assign self-generated addresses to their interfaces when there are no IPv6 routers present that can coordinate topology-relative IPv6 addresses or prefixes. This document therefore specifies a means for IPv6 nodes to generate and assign address types useful for MANET local communications.</t>
