      <t>A handover is the process during which a mobile node is handed over between access networks. Especially for vertical handovers in overlay networks the mobile node changes the access network using multiple interfaces including different link layers, e.g., WLAN, GPRS, and UMTS. Handovers occur as a consequence of lower layer (i.e., link- layer) handovers that signify a switch of the physical connection to a new location. For the duration of a handover, a mobile node is unable to send or receive traffic. The length of this disruption is considered critical because it affects the performance of the communication. An additional factor is the link layer selection. It implies the selection of the most suitable link layer from which a mobile node should receive services.</t>
