      <t>The label distribution protocol specified in [1] describes amechanism whereby one label switched router informs another of themeaning of labels used to forward traffic between and through them.This draft proposes a label aggregation technique to reduce thenumber of labels that need to be exchanged between two LSRs runningLDP.This includes a method of signalling that LSRs are capable of labelaggregation, determining when a label request can be aggregated on toan existing LSP and a method of signalling to upstream LSRs that theresulting label mapping is an aggregate.</t>
