      <t>This document proposes a practical solution for the security of SNMP packets. It allows any SNMP packet to be transmitted with strong authentication information. Packets can be optionally encrypted for full security. This encapsulation protocol is designed to allow implementations to meet USA export requirements. It supports SNMPv1 [2], SNMPv2 [11], and will support any future SNMP protocol enhancements. It can be added transparently so that investment in existing SNMP protocol stacks can be preserved. Administration is kept simple, in particular public key management and time synchronization. This encapsulation scales well to large numbers of managers and agents. It is designed to facilitate implementation and to minimize troubleshooting with extensive error reporting mechanisms.</t>
