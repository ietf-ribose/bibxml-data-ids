      <t>This draft summarizes additional personal opinions of the author for why existing stateless multicast solutions BIER/BIER-TE are not sufficient to support the operator, architecture and use-case goals that MSR6 proposes to solve. This document is complementary to problems outlined in I-D.liu-msr6- problem-statement and in no way affects any of them. Instead, it attempts to look more at lower-layer functional challenges of current stateless source routing multicast solutions (BIER/BIER-TE), as well as architectural, network and protocol design ecosystem requirements of operators.</t>
