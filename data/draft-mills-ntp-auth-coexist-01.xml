      <t>The purpose of this document is to extend the NTP/SNTP authenticationscheme to support additional features, including Public KeyInfrastructure (PKI) cryptography, in order to certify the identityof the sender and verify the integrity of the data included in anNTP message, as well as provide support for other facilities suchas a timestamp and non-repudiation service. This document describes a new extension field to support new servicesfor securely binding sender credentials to the NTP message stream.One or more of these fields can be included in the NTP header tosupport designated security services or other services should theybecome necessary. The presence of these fields does not affect theoperation of the NTP timekeeping model and protocol in any other way. Additional fields may provide means to securely bind arbitrary clientdata to be signed along with the other information in the message.The ability to sign arbitrary client data provides an important non-repudiation feature that allows this data to be cryptographically boundto an NTP timestamp, together with sender credentials and signature.</t>
