    <abstract>
      <t>This document captures requirements for Client-Facing interface to the Security Controller as defined by [RFC8327]. The interface is expressed using objects and constructs understood by Security Admin as opposed to vendor or device specific expressions associated with individual product and feature. This document identifies a broad set of requirements needed to express Security Policies based on User- constructs which are well understood by the User Community. This gives ability to decouple policy definition from policy enforcement on a specific security functional element, be it a physical or virtual.</t>
