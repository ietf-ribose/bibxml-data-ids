    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a broadcast-oriented, many-to-many Defined- trust Transport (DeftT) framework that makes it simple to express and enforce application and deployment specific integrity, authentication, access control and behavior constraints directly in the protocol stack. DeftT enables secure and completely self- contained (e.g., no external identity servers or certificate authorities) overlay networks where credentialed members can join and leave at any time. DeftT is part of a Defined-trust Communications approach with a specific example implementation available. Combined with IPv6 multicast and modern hardware-based methods for securing keys and code, it provides an easy to use foundation for secure and efficient communications in Limited Domains (RFC8799), in particular for Operational Technology (OT) networks. Conventional IP transports create optionally secured one-to-one sessions. Where member identities exist, they must either be validated via external servers or all member identities must be be preconfigured in each member during enrollment. Synchronization of data across a domain is carried out through multiple two-party transport sessions. In contrast, DeftT is a multi-party transport that synchronizes collections of secured information across all enrolled members of a domain. Security in DeftT is not optional and members are preconfigured only with their own identities and the secured rules to authenticate other member identities. This document describes an architecture that is not a standard and does not enjoy IETF consensus. (The community is invited to consider standardizing its concepts and the specification.)</t>
