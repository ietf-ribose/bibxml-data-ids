      <t>We discuss the issue of mobility in Nimrod. We identify the requirements that Nimrod has of any solution for mobility support. We also classify and compare existing approaches for supporting mobility within an internetwork and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, as an example, we outline the mechanisms to support mobility in Nimrod using the scheme currently being developed within the IETF - namely, the Mobile-IP protocol.</t>
