    <abstract>
      <t>The scaling DetNet (Deterministic Networking) technology based on cyclic queuing and scheduling is expected to solve the scalability problem of DetNet, and is hoped to extend the adaptive domain of DetNet to wide area network or even backbone network. One of the keys of this technology is to accurately obtain the cyclic mapping relationship between adjacent nodes, based on which DetNet packets can be end-to-end deterministically forwarded. This draft proposes a method for nodes to learn the cycle mapping relationship through sending learning messages.</t>
