      <t>Multi stages multiplexing configuration requirement is defined in[MULTI-STAGES-MULTIPLEXING-CONFIG-REQ] document. Multi stagesmultiplexing configuration framework is diefined in [MULTI-STAGES-MULTIPLEXING-CONFIG-FRW] document. They describe some scenarios forthe interworking between regions with 1.25G TS and 2.5G TS and themulti-domain OTN applications based on the tunnel design. Multistages multiplexing is desirable to facilitate the introduction ofnew ODU0 and ODUflex signals to an existing network without having toupgrade every node in the network. So ODU0/ODUflex can be mappedinto ODU1/ODU2/ODU3 and transit across the 2.5G TS region. Multistages multiplexing/demultiplexing are also used to support themulti-domain OTN applications based on the tunnel design. From theperspective of Management Plane and Control Plane, they must getmulti stages multiplexing/demultiplexing capability of each gatewaynodes for path computation. This document describes the OSPF-TEextension for multi stages multiplexing configuration in G.709Optical Transport Network.</t>
