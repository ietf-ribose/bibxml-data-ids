      <t>This document reports on the work of the 2008-2009 IETF nominating committee (NomCom). This draft summarizes the process steps that were used this year, and the work that was done. This is followed by a discussion of process issues which caused difficulties for the committee, but which require community agreement to before changes can be made. Finally, there are some observations about things which can help future committees, and which may help the community to understand.</t>
