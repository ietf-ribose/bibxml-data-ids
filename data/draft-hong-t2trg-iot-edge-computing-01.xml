    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes new challenges such as strict latency, uplink cost, uninterrupted services, privacy and security, for IoT services originated from the IoT environmental changes. In order to address those new challenges, the integration of Edge computing and IoT has emerged as a promising solution. This document describes the concept of IoT integrated with Edge computing as well as the state-of-the-art of IoT Edge computing. It also proposes a general model for IoT Edge computing. The direction of Edge computing for IoT should be discussed in the IETF/IRTF.</t>
