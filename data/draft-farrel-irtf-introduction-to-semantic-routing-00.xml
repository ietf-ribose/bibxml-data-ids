      <t>Many proposals have been made to add semantics to IP packets by placing additional information existing fields, by adding semantics to IP addresses, or by adding fields to the packets. The intent is to facilitate enhanced routing decisions based on these additional semantics to provide differentiated paths for different packet flows distinct from simple shortest path first routing. The process is known as Semantic Routing. This document provides a brief introduction to Semantic Routing.</t>
