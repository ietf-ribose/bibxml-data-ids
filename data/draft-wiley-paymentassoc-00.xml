    <abstract>
      <t>There is no standard, interoperable method for associating Internet service identifiers with payment information. This document specifies a means for retrieving information sufficient for a party to render payment using various payment networks given the recipient's email address by leveraging the DNS to securely publish payment information in a payment association record. A payment association record associates an Internet service identifier such as an email address with payment information such as an account number or Bitcoin address.</t>
