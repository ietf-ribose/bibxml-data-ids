      <t>This document revises the RFC 3775 rules on how Alternate Care-ofAddress option is processed. Alternate Care-of Address option isused to carry the current care-of address inside a Mobility Headermessage. This is used in addition to the source address in thepacket in order to ensure that the care-of address is protected byIPsec ESP, the security mechanism that protects Mobility Headermessages. Unfortunately, RFC 3775 did not require verification thatthe source address and care-of address are the same. This documentadds that requirement.</t>
