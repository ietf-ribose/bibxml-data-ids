      <t>Full-duplex HTTP follows the basic HTTP request-response semantics but also allows the server to send response data to the client when the client is still transmitting request body to the server. Requirements for Full-duplex HTTP are under-specified in the existing HTTP specification [RFC2616], and this memo intends to clarify the requirements for implementing Full-duplex HTTP on top of the standard HTTP protocol.</t>
