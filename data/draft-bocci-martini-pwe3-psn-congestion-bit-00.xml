      <t>Draft-ietf-pwe3-congestion-frmwk-00.txt [2] describes requirements for a PE providing a PWE3 service to take action if congestion is detected in the underlying PSN. This draft provides a control plane mechanism to enable a downstream PE detecting congestion to signal that congestion state to an upstream PE so that it may take appropriate action on its PWs. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].</t>
