    <abstract>
      <t>Recent work in the IETF has led to multiple protocols which support the classification of packets for the purposes of treating certain classes or flows of packets in a particular way compared to other packets. The successful wide-scale deployment of these protocols depends on the ability to administer and distribute consistent policy information to the multiple devices in the network which perform the classification and packet conditioning or treatment. As a result, there is a clear need to develop a scalable framework for policy administration and distribution that will enable interoperability among multiple devices and device types that must work together to achieve a consistent implementation of policy.</t>
