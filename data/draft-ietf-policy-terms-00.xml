    <abstract>
      <t>Recent work in the IETF has led to multiple protocols which supportthe classification of packets for the purposes of treating certainclasses or flows of packets in a particular way compared to otherpackets. The successful wide-scale deployment of these protocolsdepends on the ability to administer and distribute consistent policyinformation to the multiple devices in the network which perform the classification and packet conditioning or treatment. As a result,there is a clear need to develop a scalable framework for policyadministration and distribution that will enable interoperability among multiple devices and device types that must work together to achieve a consistent implementation of policy.</t>
