      <t>This document specifies the Static Artifact Exchange (SAE) protocol, an asynchronous transport pattern for exchanging cryptographic artifacts between two parties via a shared, stateless repository. SAE uses a "publish-then-poll," pull-only communication model where peers use the presence and size of immutable artifacts to coordinate a sequenced exchange. By enforcing a strict set of invariants, including a prohibition on parsing arbitrary content to drive the transport's state machine, SAE is designed to minimize common attack surfaces like injection and parser vulnerabilities. The pattern is transport-agnostic and is intended for use by higher-level cryptographic protocols, like Ephemeral Compute Attestation (ECA), that require a secure, minimal channel.</t>
