      <t>Network access servers are increasingly capable of providing user and device location information to AAA servers. This enables the AAA server to make additional authorization decisions based on the location of the user or access device. The home or visited network may also use the location information for other purposes (e.g., acting as a location server). This document provides guidelines for the encoding and transport of location information using the RADIUS protocol which are compliant with the Geopriv requirements for security and privacy.</t>
