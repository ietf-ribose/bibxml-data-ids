    <abstract>
      <t>IP packet routing and changes in routes can have major influence on protocols and services that set state in network nodes. Routing may change, for example, due to node failure within the network, need for load balancing, multihoming or due to end-host or even network mobility. This draft is a first step in helping us to decide on how these problems should be handled and how interactions with other protocols should be handled and a stimulus to further security work.</t>
