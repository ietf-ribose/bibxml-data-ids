      <t>This document describes an Application Level Gateway (ALG) for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) by which IP addresses in the SIP message and in the SDP body are statically mapped from one group to another. The SIP ALG is a specific case of an Application Level Gateway as described in [1]. Transparent use of SIP-based devices in a Network Address Translation (NAT) scenario requires that modifications be made to the SIP messages. These modifications are performed by the ALG.</t>
