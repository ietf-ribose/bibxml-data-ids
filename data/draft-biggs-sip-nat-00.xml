      <t>This document describes an Application Level Gateway (ALG) for theSession Initiation Protocol (SIP) by which IP addresses in the SIPmessage and in the SDP body are statically mapped from one group toanother. The SIP ALG is a specific case of an Application LevelGateway as described in [1].Transparent use of SIP-based devices in a Network Address Translation(NAT) scenario requires that modifications be made to the SIPmessages. These modifications are performed by the ALG.</t>
