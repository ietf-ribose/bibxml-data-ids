      <t>During the summer of 1999, a grand debate raged over the correctinterpretation of several DHCP client options as described in [RFC2132], as well as the need for one option whose proposingInternet-Draft expired.As a result of that debate, the authors gained some insights intothe intended (or unintended!) interpretation of certain optionsdefined in [RFC 2132,] particularly the Vendor Class Identifier(option 60) and Vendor Encapsulated Options (option 43.)These insights are presented in this informational Internet-Draft,whose reason for being is to act as an aid to implementers of theDHC protocol, and to future editors of the underlying RFCs andselected, current Internet-Drafts. This memo is not beingproposed as a standards-track document, but rather as an aid toclarify existing and future RFCs.</t>
