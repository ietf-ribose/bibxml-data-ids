    <abstract>
      <t>During the summer of 1999, a grand debate raged over the correct interpretation of several DHCP client options as described in [RFC 2132], as well as the need for one option whose proposing Internet-Draft expired. As a result of that debate, the authors gained some insights into the intended (or unintended!) interpretation of certain options defined in [RFC 2132,] particularly the Vendor Class Identifier (option 60) and Vendor Encapsulated Options (option 43.) These insights are presented in this informational Internet-Draft, whose reason for being is to act as an aid to implementers of the DHC protocol, and to future editors of the underlying RFCs and selected, current Internet-Drafts. This memo is not being proposed as a standards-track document, but rather as an aid to clarify existing and future RFCs.</t>
