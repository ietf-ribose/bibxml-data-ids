      <t>This memo explores some choices that arise when IPsec is to be used to implement secure 'virtual links' interconnecting customer premises VPN devices and/or network based virtual routers. The main focus is on the network based cases. Requirements are proposed and some relevant aspects of the IPsec protocol suite are discussed. A number of different protocol architectures for virtual links are then evaluated. This memo is informational in nature; it is intended that it will focus discussion toward a standard in this area.</t>
