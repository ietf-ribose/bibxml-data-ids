      <t>The Netext WG has been recently rechartered to determine what ProxyMobile IPv6 extensions are required for flow mobility support of a MNimplementing the single IP interface hiding mechanism. This documentbriefly introduces the single IP interface hiding mechanism and itderives the associated protocol operations to enable seamless flowmobility across multiple access networks. These extensions areintended to allow such mobile nodes to send and receive IP packets onmultiple physical media in a simultaneous and possibly discriminatedmanner when attached to a PMIPv6 domain. A typical usage of theseextensions is to perform downlink flow discrimination throughmultiple interfaces based on filtering rules (i.e. dedicate one MNphysical media to VOIP traffic and another MN media to HTTP traffic).The proposed extensions to PMIPv6 attempt to increment in a backwardcompatible manner the current PMIPv6 specification. In additionthese extensions use, when possible, existing specifications relatedto multihoming support at IETF and conform to the problem statementof Netext Working Group.</t>
