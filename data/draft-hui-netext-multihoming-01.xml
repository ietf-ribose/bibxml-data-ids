      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is standardized to provide network-based mobility management for a regular IPv6 mobile node, the Binding Cache Entry is built based on the HNP. If the MN is a multiple interfaces MN, these interfaces will get the different HNPs from the LMA and several BCEs are built for one MN. This will cause the invalidation of multihoming. This document introduces an extension to Proxy Mobile IPv6 for multihoming MN. Through extending the binding relationship between HNP and MAG in BCE, and synchronizing this information between LMA and MAGs, LMA can deliver data through multiple MAGs. Thus the MN attaching in a PMIPv6 domain can receive data packets with the same destination through its multiple network interfaces attaching to different MAGs simultaneously.</t>
