      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 is standardized to provide network-based mobilitymanagement for a regular IPv6 mobile node, the Binding Cache Entry isbuilt based on the HNP. If the MN is a multiple interfaces MN, theseinterfaces will get the different HNPs from the LMA and several BCEsare built for one MN. This will cause the invalidation of multihoming.This document introduces an extension to Proxy Mobile IPv6 formultihoming MN. Through extending the binding relationship betweenHNP and MAG in BCE, and synchronizing this information between LMAand MAGs, LMA can deliver data through multiple MAGs. Thus the MNattaching in a PMIPv6 domain can receive data packets with the samedestination through its multiple network interfaces attaching todifferent MAGs simultaneously.</t>
