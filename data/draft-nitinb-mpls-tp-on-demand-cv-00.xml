      <t>LSP-Ping is an existing and widely deployed OAM mechanism for MPLSLSPs. This document describes extensions to LSP-Ping so that LSP-Ping can be used to perform OAM on MPLS-TP LSPs. It also clarifiesthe procedures to be used for processing the OAM packets. Further,it describes how LSP-Ping can be used to perform ConnectivityVerification, Route Tracing and Adjacency functions in MPLS-TPnetworks.</t>
