      <t>This document formalizes a profile and a framework for the use of delegate certificates and authority tokens to strengthen the association between telephone number assignments and the entities that have the authoritative right to use them. It defines a model in which the TNAuthList Authority Token serves as a trusted representation of telephone number assignment and right-to-use (RTU), anchored by a Notary Agent that logs these associations through verifiable transparency mechanisms. The framework also extends the use of authority tokens to support other PASSporT claims like Rich Call Data (RCD) by defining a role for JWTClaimConstraint Authority Tokens. These tokens are issued by authoritative or recognized and vetted claim agents within the ecosystem to assert information associated with the entity assigned a telephone number. The Notary Agent plays a critical role in recording these claims and their provenance, enhancing transparency and accountability. Delegate certificates encapsulate and incorporate both the telephone number and associated information validated via authority tokens to the certification authority issuing them, binding them to the authenticated telephone number of the calling party. These certificates are published to a certificate transparency log, enabling relying parties to independently verify the integrity and legitimacy of number use and related claims. The VESPER (Verifiable STI PERsona) approach utilizes STIR protocols and the ACME authority token to formalizing a verifiable, auditable, and privacy-conscious foundation for associating telephone numbers with vetted entities and validated assertion of associated metadata.</t>
