      <t>This memo includes a list of manageable parameters for RSVP/SBM serverimplementations. These are in addition to those already described in RFC2206 and RFC 2213. Specifically, it describes parameters for control ofthe base signaling protocols themselves, as well as some of theadmission control decisions. These definitions are not intended to beexhaustive but they have been identified as useful for practicalimplementations.</t>
