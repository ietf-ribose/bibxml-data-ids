      <t>This memo includes a list of manageable parameters for RSVP/SBM server implementations. These are in addition to those already described in RFC 2206 and RFC 2213. Specifically, it describes parameters for control of the base signaling protocols themselves, as well as some of the admission control decisions. These definitions are not intended to be exhaustive but they have been identified as useful for practical implementations.</t>
