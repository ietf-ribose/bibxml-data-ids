    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a generic Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) solution which uses VLANs to indicate root or leaf traffic to support Ethernet-Tree (E-Tree) services. A VPLS Provider Edge (PE) model is illustrated as an example for the solution. In the solution, E-Tree VPLS PEs are interconnected by Pseudo Wires (PWs) which carry the VLAN indicating the E-Tree attribute. The MAC address-based Ethernet forwarding engine and the PW work in the same way as specified in RFC 4762 and RFC 4448 respectively. A signaling mechanism is described to support E-Tree capability and VLAN mapping negotiation.</t>
