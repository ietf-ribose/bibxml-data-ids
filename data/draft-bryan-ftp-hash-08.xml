      <t>The File Transfer Protocol does not offer any method to verify theintegrity of a transferred file, nor can two files be comparedagainst each other without actually transferring them first.Cryptographic hashes are a possible solution to this problem. In thepast, several attempts have been made to add commands to obtainchecksums and hashes, however none have been formally specified,leading to non-interoperability and confusion. To solve theseissues, this document specifies a new FTP command to be used byclients to request cryptographic hashes of files.</t>
