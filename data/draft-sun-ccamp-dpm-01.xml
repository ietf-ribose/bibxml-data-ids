    <abstract>
      <t>When setting up a label switched path (LSP) in Generalized MPLS andMPLS/TE networks, the completion of the signaling process does notnecessarily mean that the cross connection along the LSP have beenprogrammed accordingly and in a timely manner. Meanwhile, thecompletion of signaling process may be used by applications asindication that data path has become usable. The existence of thisdelay and the possible failure of cross connection programming, ifnot properly treated, will result in data loss or even applicationfailure. Characterization of this performance can thus helpdesigners to improve the application model and to build more robustapplications. This document defines a series of performance metricsto evaluate the availability of data path in the signaling process.Status of this MemoThis Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with theprovisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet EngineeringTask Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.
