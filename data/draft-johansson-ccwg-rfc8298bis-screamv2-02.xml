      <t>This memo describes a congestion control algorithm for conversational media services such as interactive video. The solution conforms to the packet conservation principle and is a hybrid loss- and delay based congestion control that also supports ECN and L4S. The algorithm is evaluated over both simulated Internet bottleneck scenarios as well as in a mobile system simulator using LongTerm Evolution (LTE) and 5G and is shown to achieve both low latency and high video throughput in these scenarios. This specification obsoletes RFC 8298. The algorithm supports handling of multiple media streams, typical use cases are streaming for remote control, AR and 3D VR googles.</t>
