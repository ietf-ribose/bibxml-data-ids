      <t>A mobile node with multiple radio interfaces running in single-radio mode will typically need IP address continuity as it migrates from one 4G wireless network to another; Mobile IPv6 is very well suited for that purpose. For such mobile nodes using Mobile IP, mobility management by the home agent can be extended to provide necessary information about the Signal Forwarding Functions (SFFs) that have been defined for WiMAX and for eHRPD/CDMA networks. In this document, we explain the operations required to support single-radio mobile nodes and specify new extensions to Mobile IPv6 Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement for supporting ease of access between mobile nodes and SFFs.</t>
