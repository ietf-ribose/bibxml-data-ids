      <t>This document provides guidelines and requirements for testing Store, Carry and Forward (SCF) systems and protocols. The Testing Requirements document is one of three that fully describe the SCF system. The other two are the SCF Problem Statement and the SCF Requirements and Expectations document. This document -00 is currently just an Skeletal Outline published so the other two SCF documents can reference it. The skeleton will be filled in within the next month.</t>
