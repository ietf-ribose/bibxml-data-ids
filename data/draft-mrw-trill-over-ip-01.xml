    <abstract>
      <t>The Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) protocol is implemented by devices called Routing Bridges (RBridges). TRILL supports both point-to-point and multi-access links and is designed so that a variety of link protocols can be used between RBridge ports. This document standardizes methods for encapsulating TRILL in UDP/IP(v4 or v6) to provide a unified TRILL campus.</t>
