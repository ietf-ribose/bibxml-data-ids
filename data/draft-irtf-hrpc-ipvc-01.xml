    <abstract>
      <t>This document aims to inform how Internet protocols and their implementations might better mitigate technical attacks at the user endpoint by describing technology-based practices to perpetrate intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV is a pervasive reality that is not limited to, but can be exacerbated with, the usage of technology. The IPV context enables the attacker to access one, some or all of: devices, local networks, authentication mechanisms, identity information, and accounts. These security compromises go beyond active and passive on-path attacks [RFC7624]. With a focus on protocols, the document describes tactics of the IPV attacker and potential counter-measures.</t>
