    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes the UDP-based Lightweight GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol (LW-GRASP), which is designed to be a lightweight version of the GeneRic Autonomic Signaling Protocol(GRASP, or the standard GRASP), with shortened messages and a built-in reliability mechanism. LW-GRASP can work reliably over UDP, making it suitable for the IoT, where lightweight and resource-constrained devices dominate. Furthermore, this document also discusses the potential way to adapt the LW-GRASP to work on the network without IP connectivity.</t>
