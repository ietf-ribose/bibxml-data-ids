      <t>This document describes a new option known as an Inter-AS option D to the 'Multi-AS Backbones' section of [RFC4364]. This option combines VPN VRFs at the Autonomous System Border Router (ASBR) as described in 'Option A' with the distribution of labeled VPN-IP routes as described in 'Option B'. In addition, this option allows for a data plane consisting of two methods of traffic forwarding between attached ASBR pairs.</t>
