      <t>Many Internet applications are used to access resources, such aspieces of information or server processes, which are available inseveral equivalent replicas on different hosts. This includes, butis not limited to, peer-to-peer file sharing applications. The goalof Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is to provideguidance to applications, which have to select one or several hostsfrom a set of candidates, that are able to provide a desiredresource. This memo proposes one possible way of implementing theALTO protocol, called H1H2. The H1H2 protocol is a client/serverprotocols between end hosts and ALTO servers that allows twodifferent ways of exchanging data between the server and the client.</t>
