      <t>Modern IPv4 home networks are often configured with multi-level of NATs and Residential gateways to separate islands of networks used for different purposes. With the introduction of IPv6 home networks we'd like to be able to maintain the same topological freedom as we have with IPv4 but without requiring any IPv6 NATs. This document specifies the topological restrictions for what we term Basic Home Networks and specifies how DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation can be used to autoconfigure IPv6 address prefixes in such networks.</t>
