      <t>The environment in which RFCs are produced has changed significantly since the inception of the series: the process for producing RFCs is now a heavyweight process; there is a large and growing set of errata, many with serious implications; and the expectations around the use of RFCs have changed significantly as document technology has evolved. In this new environment, the long-standing principle of immutability of RFCs, prevents the RFC Series from achieving its goals of technical excellence and easily understood documentation. This document addresses that by identifying a possible way forward of a new principle of limited mutability for the RFC Series that allows the publishing of new versions of RFCs in limited circumstances, replacing the principle of immutability.</t>
