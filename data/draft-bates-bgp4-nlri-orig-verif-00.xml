    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes how a BGP speaker may verify that the Network Layer Reachability Information (NLRI) of a prefix received from a peer is consistent with the allocation of IP address space as determined by the Internet Registry system. These verification procedures rely on the DNS to provide a repository of information about address space allocation provided by the Internet Registry system. Note that this is not a repository of announceable prefixes, but rather of allocation of delegated address space.</t>
