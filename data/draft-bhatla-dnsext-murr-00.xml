      <t>To date, the scenario of multiple IP addresses for same domain name arises for the case where either we have multihomed IP hosts or we have multiple servers having the same domain name and application on the client needs to approach only one of those IP hosts. However, the penetration of mobile hosts and personal devices identified, on the internet, by the user's Network Access Identifier (NAI) may create a scenario where multiple devices may have same domain name but different IP addresses and all of those devices may need to get the service or data from the application which only identifies them by their host name. This document proposes to add a new Resource Record called the Multiple Unicast Resource Record (MURR) to the DNS system. This resource record is added for a domain name where the applications retrieving the IP address for the domain name have to provide the service (like PUSH data) to all the IP addresses retrieved in the multiple MURRs for the domain name.</t>
