    <abstract>
      <t>The PCE is a core component of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) systems. The PCE has been identified as an appropriate technology for the determination of the paths of point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs). A PCE-based Central Controller (PCECC) can simplify the processing of a distributed control plane by blending it with elements of SDN and without necessarily completely replacing it. Thus, the P2MP LSP can be calculated/set up/initiated and the label-forwarding entries can also be downloaded through a centralized PCE server to each network device along the P2MP path, while leveraging the existing PCE technologies as much as possible. This document specifies the procedures and PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions for using the PCE as the central controller for provisioning labels along the path of the static P2MP LSP.</t>
