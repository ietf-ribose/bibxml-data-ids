      <t>The purpose of this draft is to analyze different options on how DHCP can be used to configure PvD aware client. This is done in light of IPR claim made by Huawei and the necessity to find an option for implementation. In order for an option to be selected it obviously must not interfere with IPR, or, IPR has to be somehow invalidated.</t>
