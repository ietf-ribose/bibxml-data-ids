      <t>This memo suggests a pragmatic specification for defining the 20-bit Flow Label field using a hybrid approach that includes options to provide IntServ as well as DiffServ based support for IPv6 Quality of Service. It also compares various suggested approaches for defining the 20-bit Flow Label field in IPv6 Base Header based on RFC 2460 (December 1998) and few other drafts. Addressing the IPv6-Multicast- QoS issues also becomes possible as a consequence. This draft clearly specifies exactly when and how various options are to be used; and in case of the MFC, exactly how a specific action might be taken by the suggested implementation. Thus the resultant mechanism is fully implementable and unambiguous as even the lower-level details have been worked out as may be required for actual implementations. The draft also has a pointer to an experimental QoS scheme called MultServ.</t>
