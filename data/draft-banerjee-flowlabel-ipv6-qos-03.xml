      <t>This memo suggests a pragmatic specification for defining the 20-bitFlow Label field using a hybrid approach that includes options toprovide IntServ as well as DiffServ based support for IPv6 Quality ofService. It also compares various suggested approaches for definingthe 20-bit Flow Label field in IPv6 Base Header based on RFC 2460(December 1998) and few other drafts. Addressing the IPv6-Multicast-QoS issues also becomes possible as a consequence. This draft clearlyspecifies exactly when and how various options are to be used; and incase of the MFC, exactly how a specific action might be taken by thesuggested implementation. Thus the resultant mechanism is fullyimplementable and unambiguous as even the lower-level details have beenworked out as may be required for actual implementations. The draftalso has a pointer to an experimental QoS scheme called MultServ.</t>
