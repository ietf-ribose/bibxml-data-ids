      <t>This document specifies a binding from the iCalendar Transport-independent Interoperability Protocol [ITIP] to a real-time transport. Calendaring entries defined by the iCalendar Object Model [ICAL] are composed using constructs from [RFC-2045], [RFC-2046], [RFC-2047], [RFC-2048] and [RFC-2049]. This document is based on the calendaring and scheduling model defined by [ICMS]. This document is based on discussions within the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Calendaring and Scheduling (CALSCH) working group. More information about the IETF CALSCH working group activities can be found on the IMC website at http://www.imc.org, the IETF website at http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/calsch-charter.html.
