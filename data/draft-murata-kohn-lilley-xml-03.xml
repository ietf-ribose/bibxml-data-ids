      <t>This document standardizes three media types -- application/xml,application/xml-external-parsed-entity, and application/xml-dtd --for use in exchanging network entities that are related to theExtensible Markup Language (XML) while deprecating text/xml and text/xml-external-parsed-entity. This document also standardizes aconvention (using the suffix '+xml') for naming media types outsideof these five types when those media types represent XML MIMEentities. XML MIME entities are currently exchanged via theHyperText Transfer Protocol on the World Wide Web, are an integralpart of the WebDAV protocol for remote web authoring, and areexpected to have utility in many domains.Major differences from [RFC3023] are deprecation of text/xml andtext/xml-external-parsed-entity, the addition of XPointer and XMLBase as fragment identifiers and base URIs, respectively, mention ofthe XPointer Registry, and updating of many references.</t>
