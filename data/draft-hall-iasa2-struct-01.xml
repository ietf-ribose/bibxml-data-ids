    <abstract>
      <t>The IETF Administrative Support Activity (IASA) was originally established in 2005. In the intervening years, the needs of the IETF have evolved in ways that require changes to its administrative structure. The purpose of this document is to spur discussion by outlining some details of what an "IASA 2.0" arrangement could look like. The proposal is for the execution of the IETF's administrative and fundraising tasks to be conducted by a new administrative organization ("IETFAdminOrg"). The IAOC would be eliminated, and its oversight and advising functions transferred to the IETFAdminOrg board and a new IETF Administrative Advisory Council, respectively.</t>
