    <abstract>
      <t>The Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP), as defined in RFC 8762, along with its optional extensions specified in RFC 8972, can be utilized for active measurement. Networks may experience transmission bit errors due to various factors, including poor fiber quality. Even with efficient CRC and FEC mechanisms, some bit errors may escape detection and correction, referred to as residual bit errors. This document further augments the STAMP extensions specified in RFC 8972 to enable the measurement of residual bit error rate within the "Extra Padding" TLV of STAMP packets.</t>
