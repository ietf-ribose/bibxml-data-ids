      <t>This document gives a short high-level overview of several practical experiments performed with mobile networks using Mobile IPv6-based NEMO extensions in the context of the IST OverDRiVE project. Laboratory experiments include simple and nested mobile networks in a pure IPv6 environment while 'field' experiments demonstrated continuous IPv6 vehicular connectivity over two publicly deployed IPv4 networks: 2.5G (GPRS) and Wireless LAN 802.11b deployed around and inside a metropolitan area.</t>
