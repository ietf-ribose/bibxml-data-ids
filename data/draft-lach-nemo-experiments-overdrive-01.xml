      <t>This document gives a short high-level overview of severalpractical experiments performed with mobile networks using MobileIPv6-based NEMO extensions in the context of the IST OverDRiVEproject. Laboratory experiments include simple and nested mobilenetworks in a pure IPv6 environment while 'field' experimentsdemonstrated continuous IPv6 vehicular connectivity over twopublicly deployed IPv4 networks: 2.5G (GPRS) and Wireless LAN802.11b deployed around and inside a metropolitan area.</t>
