      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has the potential for longperiods of time to elapse when no signaling traffic is sent between aUser Agent Client (UAC) and a User Agent Server (UAS). There aresituations when it may be necessary for some signaling traffic toflow periodically between these endpoints or to have a quick,lightweight check for whether a UAS is alive. The PING method isproposed that can be used for these purposes.</t>
