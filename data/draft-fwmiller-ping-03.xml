      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) has the potential for long periods of time to elapse when no signaling traffic is sent between a User Agent Client (UAC) and a User Agent Server (UAS). There are situations when it may be necessary for some signaling traffic to flow periodically between these endpoints or to have a quick, lightweight check for whether a UAS is alive. The PING method is proposed that can be used for these purposes.</t>
