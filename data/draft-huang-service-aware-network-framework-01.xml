    <abstract>
      <t>Cloud has been migrating from concentrated center sites to edge nodes with responsive and agile services to the subscribers. This industry-wide trend would be reasonably expected to continue into the future which would enjoy geographically ubiquitous services. Rather than transmitting service data streams to the stable and limited service locations such as centered cloud sites, routing and forwarding network will have to adapt to the emerging scenarios where the service instances would be highly dynamic and distributed, and further more, demand more fine-grained networking policies than the current routing and forwarding scheme unaware of service SLA requirements. This proposal is to demonstrate a framework under which the above-mentioned requirements would be satisfied.</t>
