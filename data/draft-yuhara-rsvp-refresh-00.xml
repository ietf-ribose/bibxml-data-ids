      <t>The purpose of this document is to provide a discussion on therefresh overhead reduction of RSVP. Specifically, this documentproposes some extensions to deal with route change while maintainingthe advantage of ID-based refreshes. For environments where PATHrefreshes must be used to detect route change, ID-only refreshes areused to decrease the message size. For environments where routechange is informed to RSVP process by some other means, a new messageis introduced to invalidate ID.</t>
