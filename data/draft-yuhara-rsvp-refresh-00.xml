      <t>The purpose of this document is to provide a discussion on the refresh overhead reduction of RSVP. Specifically, this document proposes some extensions to deal with route change while maintaining the advantage of ID-based refreshes. For environments where PATH refreshes must be used to detect route change, ID-only refreshes are used to decrease the message size. For environments where route change is informed to RSVP process by some other means, a new message is introduced to invalidate ID.</t>
