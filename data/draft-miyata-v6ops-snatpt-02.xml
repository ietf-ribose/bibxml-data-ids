      <t>This document specifies an IPv4-to-IPv6 transition mechanism to provide accessibility for IPv6 node to IPv4 node, and vice-versa. The goal of this document is not providing the most fundamental technology which could works well with additional technology. We used to have an technology called NAT-PT[RFC2766]. NAT-PT was designed to work with problematic DNS Application Level Gateway. So, it was changed to historical state by [RFC4966]. This document attempts to simplify NAT-PT specification, removing dependability on Application Layer Gateway as well as resolving problems pointed in [RFC4966].</t>
