      <t>The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)_protocol provides support for flow level multi-pathing with rapid failover for both unicast and multi-destination traffic in networks with arbitrary topology and link technology between TRILL switches. Active-active at the TRILL edge is the extension, in so far as practical, of these characteristics to end stations that are multiply connected to a TRILL campus. This informational document discusses some of the high level problems to be overcome in providing active-active at the TRILL edge.</t>
