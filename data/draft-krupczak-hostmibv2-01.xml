      <t>This memo modifies the original Host Resources MIB (RFC 1514) by converting it to the SNMPv2 SMI. Further, this memo adds clarifying text, based on implementation and deployment experience, to ambiguous MIB object specifications. It does not add nor remove managed objects from the original specification nor change their fundamental semantics. The original memo defines a MIB for use with managing host systems. This memo does not modify the original RFC's definitions or assumptions. Included from the original RFC [1]: The term 'host' is construed to mean any computer that communicates with other similar computers attached to the internet and that is directly used by one or more human beings. Although this MIB does not necessarily apply to devices whose primary function is communications services (e.g., terminal servers, routers, bridges, monitoring equipment), such relevance is not explicitly precluded. This MIB instruments attributes common to all internet hosts including, for example, both personal computers and systems that run variants of Unix.</t>
