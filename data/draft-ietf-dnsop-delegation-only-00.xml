      <t>This document introduces a new DNSKEY flag called DELEGATION_ONLY that indicates that the particular zone will never sign zone data across a label. That is, every label (dot) underneath is considered a zone cut and must have its own (signed) delegation. Additionally, it indicates the zone is expecting its parent to never bypass or override the zone. DNSSEC Validating Resolvers can use this flag to mark any data that violates the DELEGATION_ONLY policy as BOGUS.</t>
