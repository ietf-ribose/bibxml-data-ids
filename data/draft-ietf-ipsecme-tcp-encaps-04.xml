      <t>This document describes a method to transport IKE and IPsec packets over a TCP connection for traversing network middleboxes that may block IKE negotiation over UDP. This method, referred to as TCP encapsulation, involves sending both IKE packets for tunnel establishment as well as tunneled packets using ESP over a TCP connection. This method is intended to be used as a fallback option when IKE cannot be negotiated over UDP.</t>
