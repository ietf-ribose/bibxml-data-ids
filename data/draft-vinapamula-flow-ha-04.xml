    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a mechanism for a host to signal via PCP which connections should be protected against network failures. These connections will be elected to be subject to high availability mechanisms enabled at the network side. This approach assumes that aplications/users have more visibility about sensitive connections rather than any heuristic that can be enabled at the network side to guess which connections should be secured.</t>
