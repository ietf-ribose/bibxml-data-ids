      <t>This document attempts to make a balanced comparison between the RA- based and DHCPv6-based host configuration mechanisms. It compares the two on different aspects, e.g: underlying media assumptions, coordination, locality, etc. and highlights the strong and weak sides of both protocols for each scenario.</t>
