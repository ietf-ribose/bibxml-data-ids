      <t>IGMPv3 for IPv4 adds the capability for applications to expresssource filters on multicast group memberships, which allowsreceiver applications to determine the set of senders (sources)from which to accept multicast traffic. This capability alsosimplifies support of one-to-many type multicast applications. Itis expected that in the future, the same capability will beavailable in IPv6 as well.This document specifies new socket options and ioctl commands tomanage source filters for IP Multicast group memberships. It alsodefines the socket structures to provide input and outputarguments to these new APIs. These extensions are designed toprovide access to the source filtering features, while introducinga minimum of change into the system and providing completecompatibility for existing multicast applications.</t>
