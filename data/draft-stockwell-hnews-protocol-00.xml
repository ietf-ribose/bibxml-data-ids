      <t>This document defines HNEWS (HTTP News Protocol), an HTTP-tunneling news protocol. The NNTP(Network News Transfer Protocol) protocol described in RFC 977 is recast as HTTP CGI (Common Gateway Interface) requests that may be filled by any server that supports CGI. Two new commands are defined for connecting and disconnecting from an HNEWS server. Also, a mechanism for session state management is described. This document assumes that you have a working knowledge of the Common Gateway Interface [2] for running executable content on a web server and some familiarity with the NNTP news protocol [1]. A new URL scheme has also been specified for HNEWS and is described in a separate document [5].</t>
