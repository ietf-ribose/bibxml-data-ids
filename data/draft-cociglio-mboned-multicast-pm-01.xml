      <t>This document defines a method to accomplish performance monitoringmeasurements on live IP flows, including packet loss, one-way delayand jitter. The proposed method is applicable to both unicast andmulticast traffic, but only IP multicast streams are considered inthis document. The method can be implemented using tools andfeatures already available on IP routers and does not require anyprotocol extension. For this reason, it does not raise anyinteroperability issue. However, the method could be furtherimproved by means of some extension to existing protocols, but thisaspect is left for further study and it is out of the scope of thedocument.</t>
