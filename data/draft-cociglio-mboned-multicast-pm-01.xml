      <t>This document defines a method to accomplish performance monitoring measurements on live IP flows, including packet loss, one-way delay and jitter. The proposed method is applicable to both unicast and multicast traffic, but only IP multicast streams are considered in this document. The method can be implemented using tools and features already available on IP routers and does not require any protocol extension. For this reason, it does not raise any interoperability issue. However, the method could be further improved by means of some extension to existing protocols, but this aspect is left for further study and it is out of the scope of the document.</t>
