      <t>The route redistribution is often deployed in current network between two different protocols domain or instance/process, such as the ISIS domain redistribute to OSPF domain, the OSPF domain redistribute to BGP domain, IS-IS redistribute to another IS-IS instance/process and so on. The existing network have more complex multiple IGP domains architecture. Therefore, bidirectional route redistribution deployment is more complex for different protocols or instances/ processes to learn routes from each other. In recent years, these route redistributions have had many routing loops cases that cause network incident. This document proposes a simplified method to positively avoid routing loop, and introduces new sub-TLVs to support advertisement IPv4 and IPv6 prefix extended attribute as Redistribution Credibility ID, while redistributing route from one protocol domain or instance/ process to another.</t>
