      <t>The design of the core QUIC transport subsumes many HTTP/2 features, prominent among them stream multiplexing. A key advantage of the QUIC transport is stream multiplexing free of head-of-line (HoL) blocking between streams. In HTTP/2, multiplexed streams can suffer HoL blocking due to TCP. If HTTP/2's HPACK is used for header compression, HTTP/QUIC is still vulnerable to HoL blocking, because of HPACK's assumption of in-order delivery. This draft defines QCRAM, a variation of HPACK and mechanisms in the HTTP/QUIC mapping that allow the flexibility to avoid header-compression-induced HoL blocking.</t>
