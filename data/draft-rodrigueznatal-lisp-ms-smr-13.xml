      <t>This document extends [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis] to allow Map Servers to send SMR messages. This extension is intended to be used in some SDN deployments that use LISP as a southbound protocol with (P)ITRs that are compliant with [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis]. In this use-case mapping updates do not come from ETRs, but rather from a centralized controller that pushes the updates directly to the Mapping System. In such deployments, Map Servers will benefit from having a mechanism to inform directly (P)ITRs about updates in the mappings they are serving. Although implementations of this extension exist, this extension is deprecated by [I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub] and it is being documented for informational purposes. Newer implementations should look into [I-D.ietf-lisp-pubsub] to support PubSub in LISP deployments.</t>
