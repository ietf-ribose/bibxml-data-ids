      <t>This draft describes distributed flow-mapping applied according to RFC 6830 Locator ID Separation Protocol (LISP) for dynamic scaling of virtualized network functions (NFV) . Network functions such as subscriber management-mobility-security-quality, are typically delivered using proprietary appliances topologically embedded into the network as service-nodes or service-blades. Next generation virtualized network functions are pure software instances running on standard servers - unbundled building blocks of processing capacity and modular functionality. LISP based flow-mapping dynamically wires VNF instances into the data-path, and scales virtualized functions by steering the right traffic in the right sequence to the right process.</t>
