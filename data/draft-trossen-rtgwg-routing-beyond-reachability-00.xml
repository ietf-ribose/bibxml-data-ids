    <abstract>
      <t>This document discusses the evolution of the Internet routing system beyond mere reachability. We observe, through examples of past development, that such evolution has been taking place to improve on capabilities of the Internet, deal with more complicated network deployments and cater to changing requirements by end users as well as novel and emerging applications. For achieving a routing system that serves more than a singular reachability purpose, more information is taken into account when performing the purpose-specific functions. Such extra information can be obtained by extending current routing protocols to exchange more information or by carrying that information within packets. This document is intended to seed discussions of how the observed evolution of the Internet's routing system can continue, what issues may occur when simply continuing the current approach for achieving routing beyond 'mere' reachability and what may be needed to address those issues. Ultimately, however, this document recognizes the positive impact that moving beyond reachability has brought to the Internet and will continue to do so.</t>
