      <t>In developing a solution for CDN Internetworking it is necessary to define and accommodate requirements for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting. Since the Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) working group is already focused on defining these requirements, this document attempts to leverage that work. It contains the requirements that would have to be supported by a AAA service to formulate a solution for CDN peering.</t>
