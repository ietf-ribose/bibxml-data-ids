      <t>This document outlines BT's requirements for MPLS-TP features basedon our current thinking for how we may utilise functionality beingdefined as part of the MPLS-TP standardisation effort within ourexisting deployed MPLS networks.This document is not intended to describe all future requirements forMPLS-TP features, only for those features that we have a currentlydefined requirement for today and which we would like to see prioritybe given to them when specifying and standardising MPLS-TP withinIETF. These features are required in order to enable us to enhancelive, revenue generating services.</t>
