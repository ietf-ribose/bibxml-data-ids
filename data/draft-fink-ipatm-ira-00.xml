      <t>This Internet Draft proposes a new model for the use of IP over ATM networks, to be known as the Integrated Routing &amp; Addressing (IRA) model. The basic idea is simple, namely to use IPv6/IPv4 addresses for IP/ATM nodes by embedding them in an ATM NSAP address, and then using the same hierarchical prefix routing for both the ATM and IP layers, thus providing a seamless integration of the two technologies. The basic purpose of the IRA model is to recognize the commonality of requirements between the existing Internet and a new global ATM infrastructure, avoid unnecessary duplication of effort, and allow each technology to take maximal advantage of the strengths of the other. This model is briefly compared with other models such as the 'Classical IP and ARP over ATM' model and the 'NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP)' model. The method by which IP hosts and routers would utilize the IRA model is presented, including a protocol called Prefix Route Exchange (PRE), which would be used to exchange prefix routes between an IP router or host and its directly attached ATM switch.</t>
