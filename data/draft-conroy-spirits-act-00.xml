      <t>This Internet Draft has been written at the request of one of theSPIRITS Working Group co-chairs in order to elicit discussion on whatextended functionality SPIRITS may be used to provide.It has been requested that mapping to any specific protocol is notundertaken at this juncture. As such, only 'possible' functionalityis identified and no mapping to existing protocol methods is given.This document is only intended to provide a basis for discussion andwould be expected to form one aspect of the requirements for SPIRITS.As such the terminology used is deliberately and (we hope) suitablyambiguous.</t>
