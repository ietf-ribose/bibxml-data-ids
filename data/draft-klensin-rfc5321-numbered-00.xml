      <t>20 This document is a specification of the basic protocol for Internet21 electronic mail transport. It consolidates, updates, and clarifies22 several previous documents, making all or parts of most of them23 obsolete. It covers the SMTP extension mechanisms and best practices24 for the contemporary Internet, but does not provide details about25 particular extensions. Although SMTP was designed as a mail26 transport and delivery protocol, this specification also contains27 information that is important to its use as a "mail submission"28 protocol for "split-UA" (User Agent) mail reading systems and mobile29 environments.56 58 Internet-Draft RFC5321-NumberedDec 2008</t>
