      <t>This document specifies a new optional extension to IPv6 Router Advertisement messages to allow IPv6 routers to advertise DS-Lite AFTR addresses to IPv6 hosts (i.e., a default IPv6 route for DS-Lite traffic). The provisioning of the AFTR address is crucial to access IPv4 connectivity services in a DS-Lite context. Means to ensure reliable delivery of this information to connecting hosts is a must. Furthermore, this RA option can be used as a means to distribute DS- Lite serviced customers among a set of deployed AFTRs without requiring a central knowledge of the underlying topology and deployed AFTRs.</t>
