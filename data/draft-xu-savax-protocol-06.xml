    <abstract>
      <t>Because the Internet forwards packets according to the IP destination address, packet forwarding typically takes place without inspection of the source address and malicious attacks have been launched using spoofed source addresses. The inter-domain source address validation architecture is an effort to enhance the Internet by using state machines to generate consistent tags. When communicating between two end hosts at different ADs of the IPv6 network, tags will be added to the packets to identify the authenticity of the IPv6 source address. This memo focuses on the data plane of the SAVA-X mechanism.</t>
