      <t>This document provides an analysis of the requirements to support mobility in a dual stack network. In this document, combinations of IPv4, IPv6, and dual stack mobile node moving in IPv4, IPv6, and dual stack networks are listed and the requirements to support mobility under different network and mobile node configurations are investigated. This document aims to reassess next generation transition (NGTRANS) tools from the point of view of mobility.</t>
