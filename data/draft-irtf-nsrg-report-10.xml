      <t>Over the last few years, the use of IP addresses for Internet connectivity has changed dramatically. The Name Space Research Group (NSRG) was chartered by the IRTF to review these changes, and make recommendations on whether or not remediation within the protocol stack is necessary. This document reports the outcome of some of the discussions within the research group. One of the questiones addressed by the NSRG is: Does the TCP/IP protocol suite need an additional level of naming above layer 3 but below the application layer? There was no consensus on the answer. This document reviews the motivation for an additional naming mechanism, reviews related work, proposes a straw man 'stack name' and discusses the structure and use of those names.</t>
