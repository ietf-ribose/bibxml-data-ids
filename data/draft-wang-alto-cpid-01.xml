      <t>The goal of the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)protocol is to provide guidance to applications which have to selectone or several hosts from a set of candidates, all of which are ableto provide the desired resource. The goal of the mechanismsspecified in this document is to extend the existing solution, andprovide basic attributes to each end terminal to make it network-aware. These mechanisms introduce a way to directly transfer theguidance or costs using Network Location identifiers/PIDs, calledCPIDs. And the exisiting The proposed solution inherits the existingsolution's architecture, messages, and other mechanisms. It can beused as an independent solution or function together with otherfunctions in the existing solution to provide guidance for differentclient and balance the workload on the server. Additional detailsfor the process will be provided in the next version of the draft.</t>
