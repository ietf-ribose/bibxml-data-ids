      <t>This draft proposes an efficient model called ''Facility based computation model'' for computing bypass tunnels paths in the context of the MPLS TE Fast Reroute, while allowing bandwidth sharing between backup tunnel protecting independent resources. Both a centralized and a distributed path computation scenarios are described. The required signaling extensions are also addressed in the draft.</t>
