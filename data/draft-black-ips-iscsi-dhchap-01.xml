      <t>This draft describes an authentication mechanism based on enhancing CHAP [RFC 1994] with a Diffie-Hellman Exchange (see Section 22.1 of [Schneier] in order to prevent a passive eavesdropper from acquiring sufficient information to perform an off-line dictionary attack on the CHAP secret. The use of this authentication mechanism with iSCSI [iSCSI] is discussed, along with a brief comparison to the existing CHAP and SRP authentication mechanisms in iSCSI. Caution should be exercised in drawing inferences from the fact that the author of this draft is one of the chairs of the IP Storage Working Group. This draft is an individual submission that the IP Storage Working Group is free to adopt, modify, reject, fold, spindle, and/or mutilate as it sees fit.</t>
