      <t>In a SIP network, call and session state resides in the user agents at the edge of the network. These user agents can be elements such as gateways, conferencing servers, and media servers whose availability is important for service delivery. In order to achieve fault tolerance for these user agents, this state must somehow be replicated to backup servers. Traditionally, replication is done through direct memory copies between a primary and its backup. However, the soft-state nature of SIP re-INVITEs means that an alternate mechanism for call state replication is possible. This document proposes mechanisms for reconstituting call state in a UA through triggered re-INVITEs from a peer.</t>
