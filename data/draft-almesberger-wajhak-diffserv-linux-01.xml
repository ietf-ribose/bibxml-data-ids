      <t>Recent Linux kernels offer a wide variety of traffic control functions, which can be combined in a modular way. We have designed support for Differentiated Services based on the existing traffic control elements, and we have implemented new components where necessary. In this document we give a brief overview of the structure of Linux traffic control, and we describe our prototype implementation in more detail.</t>
