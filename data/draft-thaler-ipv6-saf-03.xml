      <t>There are various recent proposals that would result in IPv6translation becoming permanent. RFC 3424 discusses UNilateral Self-Address Fixing (UNSAF) mechanisms which are required for applicationsto work with most translation schemes, points out a number ofproblems with them, and requires an exit strategy for any UNSAFmechanism. This document discusses an alternative to UNSAFmechanisms should IPv6 translation become permanent.</t>
