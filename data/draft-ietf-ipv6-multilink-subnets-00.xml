    <abstract>
      <t>Bridging multiple links into a single entity has several operational advantages. A single subnet prefix is sufficient to support multiple physical links. There is no need to allocate subnet numbers to the different networks, simplifying management. This document introduces the concept of a 'multilink subnet', defined as a collection of independent links, connected by routers, but sharing a common subnet prefix. It then specifies the behavior of multilink subnet routers so that no changes to host behavior are needed.</t>
