      <t>This paper presents a set of requirements for systems that resolve URNs into hints for locating resources. Hints are a type of metadata that provide information about locating a resource, including but not limited to URLs and pointers to other resolution systems. The requirements fall into three broad areas: usability, security, and evolvability. With those in mind, the paper reviews what we have been able to learn about the NAPTR proposal. The NAPTR proposal has grown out of a set of several different URN resolution proposals; it uses the existing DNS infrastructure to store and serve resolution information. To this end they introduce a new kind of DNS entry called a NAPTR, or Naming Authority PoinTeR. The review of the NAPTR proposal includes our wishlist for extensions and modifications to it that would add evolutionary paths to the design without sacrificing ease of implementation. The paper then presents a sketch of a more extensive URN resolution system, presented in order to demonstrate the need for evolution in any URN resolution proposal.</t>
