      <t>As the work of the NSIS working group has begun there are also concerns about security and its implication for the design of a signaling protocol. In order to understand the security properties and available options of RSVP a number of documents have to be read. This document tries to summarize the security properties of RSVP and to view them from a different point of view. This work in NSIS is part of the overall process of analyzing other protocols and to learn from their design considerations. This document should also provide a starting point for further discussions.</t>
