      <t>The protocol specified in this document is designed to providemulticast and broadcast functionality in mobile ad hoc networks. Itutilizes the Route Discovery mechanism defined by the Dynamic SourceRouting protocol (DSR) [4, 5, 7] to flood the data packets throughthe network. Although this protocol is derived from DSR, it can beimplemented as a stand-alone protocol. In fact, it does not relyon unicast routing to operate. If DSR is already implemented onthe network, very minor modifications are required to enable thisprotocol.</t>
