    <abstract>
      <t>The protocol specified in this document is designed to provide multicast and broadcast functionality in mobile ad hoc networks. It utilizes the Route Discovery mechanism defined by the Dynamic Source Routing protocol (DSR) [4, 5, 7] to flood the data packets through the network. Although this protocol is derived from DSR, it can be implemented as a stand-alone protocol. In fact, it does not rely on unicast routing to operate. If DSR is already implemented on the network, very minor modifications are required to enable this protocol.</t>
