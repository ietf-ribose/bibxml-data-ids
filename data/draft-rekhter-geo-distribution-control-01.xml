      <t>Consider a content provider that wants to deliver a particular content to a set of customers/subscribers, where the provider and the subscribers are connected by an IP service provider. This document covers two areas needed to accomplish this: (1) providing the content provider with the information of whether it can use the multicast connectivity service provided by the IP service provider to deliver a particular content to a particular set of subscribers, and (2) providing the content provider with a mechanism to restrict delivery of a given content to a particular set of the subscribers.</t>
