    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes three ways to extend the existing ICP protocol in order to support today's content-based Internet environment. Since the newly created PPSP protocol is especially designed for today's network condition, we will take its advantages here. The three proposals are: (1) Embedding PPSP in ICP; (2) PPSP and ICP Co-existing in caches communication; (3) Using PPSP to replace ICP.</t>
