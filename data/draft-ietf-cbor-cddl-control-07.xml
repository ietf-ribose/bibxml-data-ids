      <t>The Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), standardized in RFC 8610, provides "control operators" as its main language extension point. The present document defines a number of control operators that were not yet ready at the time RFC 8610 was completed: .plus, .cat and .det for the construction of constants, .abnf/.abnfb for including ABNF (RFC 5234/RFC 7405) in CDDL specifications, and .feature for indicating the use of a non-basic feature in an instance.</t>
