      <t>This draft describes network time synchronization mechanisms that may enable increased accuracy, beyond that possible with the current Network Time Protocol version 4 standard, to the time of computer clocks. The mechanisms considered are those that will provide improved estimates as to when a packet is put on the network, transferred across a network, or taken from the network. Potential standardization actions will be considered for the mechanisms considered, though no such actions are recommended at this time.</t>
