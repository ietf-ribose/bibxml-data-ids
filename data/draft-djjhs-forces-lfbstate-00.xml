      <t>The ForCES LFB Topology currently defines that once an instance of an LFB class is created it becomes immediately active in the datatapath. This document makes a slight extension to add state to an instantiated LFB class allowing the CE to decide when an LFB instance becomes operational on the datapath.</t>
