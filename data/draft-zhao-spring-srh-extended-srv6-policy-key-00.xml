      <t>This paper defines a new extension header-SRv6 Policy Key to focusing on the problems of timeliness and accuracy of controller-aware paths in SRv6 networks. The scheme enables network nodes to report path information to the controller by adding a path unique identifier to the message header, which ensures that the controller has a real-time and accurate picture of the SR path status. Even if the SID is lost in transmission or the controller is unable to monitor it in real time and accurately. This approach aims to network availability and O&amp;M efficiency of SDN, particularly in scenarios involving multi-path tunnel configurations and load balancing.</t>
