      <t>SOBER-128 is a fast software-oriented stream cipher based on simple 32-bit operations. Keys of up to 128 bits and optional nonces of arbitrary length are supported. SOBER-128 may be configured to calculate an arbitrary length Message Authentication Code (MAC) as part of the encryption or decryption process. Source code for SOBER-128 is freely available, and use of this source code, or independent implementations, is permitted for any purpose under a fee free license.</t>
