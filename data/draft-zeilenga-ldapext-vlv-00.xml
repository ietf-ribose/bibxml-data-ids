      <t>This document describes an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) Virtual List View (VLV) operation. The operation allows the client to obtain portion (the view) of an ordered set (the list) of entries visible through a virtual window. The client can reissue the operation with different criteria to obtain a different view of the list. Clients may use this operation to page, scroll, or browse directory content. The VLV operation is defined as a set of LDAP controls which extend the Search operation. The VLV controls may be used in conjunction with a number of other search controls, such as the Server Side Sorting of Search Results (RFC 2891) control.</t>
