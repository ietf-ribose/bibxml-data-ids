    <abstract>
      <t>Some Wireless Ad hoc Networks (WANETs) like LLNs often have different devices capabilities, with large scale deployment at different regions or environment conditions. In that network context, nodes may not be able to participate in certain time periods because of determined conditions. The Node Ability of Participation (NAP) protocol enhances the network use of its activities and capabilities. Routers and actuators in such networks can be adaptive and efficient for different unpredicted situations.</t>
