      <t>In order to compute and provide optimal paths, Path Computation Elements (PCEs) require an accurate and timely Traffic Engineering Database (TED). Traditionally this TED has been obtained from a link state routing protocol supporting traffic engineering extensions. This document discusses possible alternatives and enhancements to the existing approach to TED creation. This document gives architectural alternatives for these alternatives and their potential impacts on network nodes, routing protocols, and PCEP.</t>
