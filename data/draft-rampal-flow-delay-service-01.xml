    <abstract>
      <t>The purpose of this document is to illustrate when and how flow aggregation can be of benefit in the context of the Guaranteed Service. Specifically, it identifies simple cases and provides generic rules for when grouping of flows allows a reduction in the amount of resources (bandwidth) needed to ensure the deterministic Guaranteed Service delay bounds of all flows. The benefits of grouping should be especially of interest to, say, Internet Service Providers, wishing to interconnect sites with Guaranteed Service flows. In particular, this document shows that in the case of flows with identical traffic characteristics and requirements, e.g., Internet voice, grouping of flows is ALWAYS beneficial. This technique is not intended for IETF standardization and is being submitted for informational purposes only.</t>
