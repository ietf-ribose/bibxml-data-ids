      <t>Confidential virtual machine (CVM) in the cloud environment is a use case of confidential computing where VM confidentiality is enabled by hardware. A cloud userâ€™s CVM is isolated from the hypervisor provided by its cloud service provider, meaning the cloud service provider cannot access the workload and data in the CVM. This is used in the scenario where a cloud user intends to protect its sensitive workload and data from cloud service provider while at the same time desires to utilize the advantages of cloud technology. This document specifies the CVM provisioning in cloud environment including the provisioning process and protocol, and the security requirements.</t>
