      <t>This document discusses issues associated with the use of protocols developed in the IETF's IPsec working group, specifically, RFC 2409 [IKE] and RFC 2408 [ISAKMP]. It is expected that the reader is familiar with those documents. As stated earlier, this document does not specify standards of any kind, and is intended as information for IPsec implementers.</t>
