      <t>The messages of the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol are made up of payloads. The current protocol limits each of these payloads to 64KB by having a 2-byte length field. While this is usually enough, several of the payloads may need to be larger. This document defines an extension to IKEv2 that allows larger payloads.</t>
