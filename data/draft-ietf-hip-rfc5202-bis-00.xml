      <t>This memo specifies an Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) basedmechanism for transmission of user data packets, to be used with theHost Identity Protocol (HIP).IESG NoteThe following issues describe IESG concerns about this document. TheIESG expects that these issues will be addressed when future versionsof HIP are designed.In case of complex Security Policy Databases (SPDs) and the co-existence of HIP and security-related protocols such as IKE,implementors may encounter conditions that are unspecified in thesedocuments. For example, when the SPD defines an IP address subnet tobe protected and a HIP host is residing in that IP address area,there is a possibility that the communication is encrypted multipletimes. Readers are advised to pay special attention when running HIPwith complex SPD settings. Future specifications should clearlydefine when multiple encryption is intended, and when it should beavoided.</t>
