      <t>With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different cryptographic algorithms. Since the trustworthiness of individual post-quantum algorithms is at question, a multi-key cryptographic operation will need to be performed in such a way that breaking it requires breaking each of the component algorithms individually. This requires defining new structures for holding composite public keys and composite signature data. This draft defines a structure generic enough to be useful beyond the post-quantum transition for any situation where a widely-supported but untrusted algorithm is being migrated to newer cryptography. This document defines structures for binding an explicit pair of cryptographic algorithms together into a single object identifier, and it provides ASN.1 structures for encoding these pairwise composite public keys, private keys in wire protocols, as well as using them in conjunction with composite signatures, encryption and key transport mechanisms.</t>
