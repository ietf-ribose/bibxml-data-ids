      <t>IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) has been compared in conversations to SWAP (Simple Workflow Access Protocol). Both are for starting an asynchronous job, and then being able to check up on it later. The IPP is specifically designed for printers and print jobs. SWAP is more generic, and is generally oriented toward more computational jobs. But many of the problems encountered are the same, and the approach to the solutions can be examined and compared. This document goes through the features point by point and shows in what ways they are similar, and more importantly in what ways their approaches differ. The purpose of this is to guide discussions about the two protocols.</t>
