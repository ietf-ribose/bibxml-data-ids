      <t>IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) has been compared in conversations to SWAP(Simple Workflow Access Protocol). Both are for starting an asynchronousjob, and then being able to check up on it later. The IPP is specificallydesigned for printers and print jobs. SWAP is more generic, and isgenerally oriented toward more computational jobs. But many of theproblems encountered are the same, and the approach to the solutions can beexamined and compared. This document goes through the features point bypoint and shows in what ways they are similar, and more importantly in whatways their approaches differ. The purpose of this is to guide discussionsabout the two protocols.</t>
