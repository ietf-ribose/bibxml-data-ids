      <t>When a DNS server filters a query, the response to such query conveys no detailed explanation that elaborates why that query was blocked, leading thus to end-user confusion. A solution to this problem is needed in order to enhance the user experience. This document defines a method to return an URI that explains the reason why a DNS query was filtered by a DNS server.</t>
