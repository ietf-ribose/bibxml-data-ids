      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol allows the use of UDP for transportof SIP messages. The use of UDP inherently risks network congestionproblems, as UDP itself does not define congestion prevention,avoidance, detection, or correction mechanisms. This problem isaggravated by large SIP messages which fragment at the UDP level.Transport protocols in SIP are also negotiated on a per-hop basis, atthe SIP level, so SIP proxies may convert from TCP to UDP and soforth. This document defines by which a SIP User Agent may requirethat its requests are not sent over UDP or other transports havingcongestion-related characteristics similar to those of UDP.</t>
