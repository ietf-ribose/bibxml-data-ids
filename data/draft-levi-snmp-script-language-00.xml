      <t>The development of sophisticated network management applications based on the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) often requires automation of complex series of SNMP requests. Writing code for performing these requests can become a considerable burden. Programmers must write code for building VarBind lists, Pdu structures, and Authentication structures, and for parsing these structures. Programmers must deal with multiplexing multiple SNMP requests along with any other I/O that the application must handle.</t>
