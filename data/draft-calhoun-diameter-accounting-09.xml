    <abstract>
      <t>The DIAMETER protocol provides Authentication and Authorization for network access technologies, such as NASREQ, ROAMOPS and Mobile IP. The ROAMOPS WG has been working on an accounting data format, called Accounting Data Interchange Format (ADIF), as a method to transfer accounting information over a wide variety of transports. This extension describes how accounting records can be securely transmitted over the DIAMETER protocol. When combined with the Strong Security extension, accounting records MAY traverse intermediate proxies in a secure fashion and is compatible with the referral broker model. This extension allows for both real-time and batched accounting transfers.</t>
