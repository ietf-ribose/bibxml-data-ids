      <t>This document defines a URI scheme, 'go:' to be used with the Common Name Resolution Protocol. Specifically it lays out the syntactic components and how those components are used by URI Resolution to find the available transports for a CNRP service. Care should be taken with several of the URI components because, while they may look like components found in other URI schemes, they often do not act like them. The 'go' scheme has more in common with the location independent 'news' scheme than any other URI scheme.</t>
