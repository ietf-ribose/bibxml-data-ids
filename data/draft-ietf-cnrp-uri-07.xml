      <t>This document defines a URI scheme, 'go:' to be used with the CommonName Resolution Protocol. Specifically it lays out the syntacticcomponents and how those components are used by URI Resolution tofind the available transports for a CNRP service. Care should betaken with several of the URI components because, while they may looklike components found in other URI schemes, they often do not actlike them. The 'go' scheme has more in common with the locationindependent 'news' scheme than any other URI scheme.</t>
