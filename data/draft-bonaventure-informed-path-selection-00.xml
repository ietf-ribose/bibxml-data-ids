      <t>With today's peer-to-peer applications, more and more content isavailable from multiple sources. In tomorrow's Internet hosts willhave multiple paths to reach one destination host with the deploymentof dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 hosts, but also with new techniques such asshim6 or other locator/identifier mechanisms being discussed withinthe IRTF RRG. All these hosts will need to rank paths in order toselect the best paths to reach a given destination/content. In thisdraft, we propose an informed path selection service that would bequeried by hosts and would rank paths based on policies andperformance metrics defined by the network operator to meet histraffic engineering objectives. A companion document describes aprotocol that implements this service.</t>
