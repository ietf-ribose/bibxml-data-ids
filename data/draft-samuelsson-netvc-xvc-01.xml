      <t>This document presents a high-level technical description of the xvc video codec. The xvc video codec is a novel video codec that was released in its first version in September 2017. This document provides some technical information as well as a discussion section around how the xvc codec meets the objectives of the NETVC Working Group. The document also includes results comparing the second version of xvc with AV1 and HM for three different test cases; All- Intra, single pass Random-Access, and multi-pass Random-Access. Results are also presented for the full xvc codec relative to the royalty-free baseline profile of xvc.</t>
