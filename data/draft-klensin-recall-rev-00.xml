      <t>The procedures for initiating a recall specified in RFC 3777 restrict signatories to those who are "nomcom qualified". Perhaps inadvertently, this prohibits members of the IESG and IAB from initiating these procedures. This document suggests that limitation was an unanticipated and undesirable side-effect and proposes to remove it. This document is intended to update RFC 3777.</t>
