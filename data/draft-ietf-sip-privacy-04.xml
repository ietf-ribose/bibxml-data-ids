      <t>This document describes extensions to SIP that enable a network of trusted SIP servers to assert the identity of end users or end systems, and to convey indications of end-user requested privacy. The use of these extensions are only applicable inside an administrative domain, or among federations of administrative domains with previously agreed-upon policies for usage of such information. This document does NOT offer a general privacy or identity model suitable for inter-domain use or use in the Internet at large.</t>
