    <abstract>
      <t>Conventional multicast builds a tree structure from the source of amulticast stream to the destinations of that stream. Multicastpackets are forwarded from the sources down the tree by eachintervening router. Each router contains state information todetermine the next hop forwarding destination(s) for a packet. Wherethere are a large number of groups, this gives rise to a scalingproblem. The amount of state to be stored in the routers becomesimpossibly large.It is attractive to consider the use of multicast to provideapplications such as n-way voice and video conferencing, which wouldrequire a very large number (perhaps millions) of relatively small(between 3 and 10 members) multicast groups.</t>
