      <t>The Tunneled Group Secure Association Key Management Protocol(T-GSAKMP) provides a security framework for creating cryptographicgroups on a network. It is designed to provide key distributionservices under the cryptographic protection of a pairwise SA,like IPSec. T-GSAKMP relies on the pairwise SA to provide dataconfidentiality services for policy, DoS mitigation services,and protection from 'man-in-the-middle' attacks. It providesmechanisms to disseminate group security policy, perform accesscontrol based upon PKI certificates, generate group keys,and recover from compromise. This framework addresses groupscalability issues by facilitating delegation of process-intensiveactions in a secure and controlled manner.</t>
