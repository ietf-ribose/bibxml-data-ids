    <abstract>
      <t>Evolution toward network operations automation requires systems encompassing software-based analytics and decision-making. Network- based instrumentation provides crucial data for these components and processes. However, the proliferation of such instrumentation and the need to migrate the data it generates from the physical network to "off-the-network" software, poses challenges. In particular, analog measurement instrumentation, which generates time-continuous real number data, may generate significant data volumes. Methodologies for handling analog measurement instrumentation data will need to be identified and discussed, informed in part by consideration of requirements for the operation of network digital twins, which may be important software-realm consumers of such data.</t>
