      <t>This document presents extensions to the Whois protocol outputformat which enables a possibility for the server to send referalinformation to the Whois client. This referal mechanism can be usedfor example in a situation with a registrar/registry model, wherethe registrars all have their own Whois databases, and together theyserve a whole TLD. It can also be used when implementing aroot-whois service on top of all whois servers in the world, andthis way enable the possibility of creating advanced proxy services.For the latter, a registration procedure is also suggested, whereWhois services can be registered.Discussion on this Internet-Draft is to be held on the mailing listietf-whois-ext@imc.org, which is hosted by the Internet MailConsortium.
