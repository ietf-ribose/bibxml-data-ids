    <abstract>
      <t>IPv4-over-IPv6 transition mechanisms provide both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity services simultaneously during the IPv4/IPv6 co-existing period. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) options have been defined to configure Customer Edge (CE) in MAP-E, MAP-T, and Lightweight 4over6. However, in many networks, the configuration information may be stored in an Authentication Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server, while user configuration information is mainly provided by the Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) through the DHCPv6 protocol. This document defines two new Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) attributes that carry CE configuration information from an AAA server to BNG.</t>
