      <t>When using the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to perform route origin validation (ROV) with route origin authorizations (ROAs), there have been security and usability issues identified and reported. This memo revisits these issues from the perspective of the operational granularity of ROA management, demonstrates problems and their root cause with the existing ROA encoding scheme, summarizes design requirements to address them, and evaluates three potential solutions. Though neither of existing solutions satisfies all requirements, a hybrid solution composed of two existing schemes is recommended to use in ROA management.</t>
