      <t>This document introduces a new client type for the COPS protocol to support Multiprotocol-DiffServ inter-working in a network scenario where the access network is a non-DiffServ network. In such a scenario, traffic flows originating from heterogeneous applications ask to be admitted to the Diffserv core network. The Policy Decision Point (PDP) acts as a 'Bandwidth Broker' for Policy Enforcement Points(PEP) requesting resources. The new client type is located on each Border Router (PEP) of the Diffserv Network.</t>
