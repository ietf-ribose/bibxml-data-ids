    <abstract>
      <t>Some Internet of Things application domains, such as lighting, have strict requirements on latency for group communication. From a user experience point of view latency less than 200 ms is necessary from an action triggered by a user to the visible effects. This draft describes procedures for authorization, key management, and securing group messages within a low latency application domain with a special emphasis on lighting systems. We specify the usage of object security at the application layer for group communication and assume that CoAP is used as the application layer protocol.</t>
