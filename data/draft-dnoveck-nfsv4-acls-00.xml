      <t>This document describes the structure of NFSv4 ACLs and their role in the NFSv4 security architecture. While their role in providing a more flexible approach to file access authorization than is made available by the POSIX-derived authorization-related attributes, the potential provision of other security-related functionality is covered as well. While the goals of the description are similar to that used in previous specficaion, the approach taken is substantally different, in that a core set of functionality, derived form the the now- withdrawn POSIX draft ACLs is the conceptual base of the feature set while extensions to that functionality are made available as OPTIONAL extensions to that core. The current version of the document is intended, in large part, to result in working group discussion regarding existing NFSv4 security issues and to provide a framework for addressing these issues and obtaining working group consensus regarding necessary changes. When the resulting document is eventually published as an RFC, it will supersede the descriptions of ACL structure and semantics appearing in existing minor version specification documents such as RFCs 7530 and 8881, thereby updating RFC7530 and RFC8881.</t>
