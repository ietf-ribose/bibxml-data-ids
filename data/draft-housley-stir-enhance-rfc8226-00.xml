    <abstract>
      <t>RFC 8226 provides a certificate extension to constrain the JWT claims that can be included in the PASSporT as defined in RFC 8225. If the signer includes a JWT claim outside the constraint boundaries, then the recipient will reject the entire PASSporT. This document defines additional ways that the JWT claims can be constrained.</t>
