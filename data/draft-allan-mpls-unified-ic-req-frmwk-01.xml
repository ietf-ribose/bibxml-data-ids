      <t>The definition of a transport profile for MPLS means that MPLS network architectures will emerge that combines both managed and control plane driven MPLS sub-networks and requires interconnection of same to achieve a unified MPLS architecture. This document generalizes the problem of sub-network interconnect, discusses issues in general and suggests ways forward.</t>
