    <abstract>
      <t>IPv6 prefixes are typically delegated to requesting routers which then use them to number their downstream-attached links and networks. This document considers prefix delegation models according to whether the requesting router acts as a router on behalf of any downstream networks, as host on behalf of its local applications or as both.</t>
