      <t>This document describes the air interface of the Metropolitan Beacon System (MBS) system. MBS provides a high precision, reliable, consistent positioning system indoors and in urban canyons, where GNSS solutions are degraded or denied. In addition to the high 2-D accuracy, the MBS system architecture also provides for high resolution and accuracy in the vertical dimension, with the aid of embedded sensors. MBS technology provides a very fast time to first fix (TTFF), on the order of ~6 seconds under cold start conditions. Similar to GNSS, MBS technology allows computation of the location on the device without any network dependence thus enabling a wide variety of standalone applications.</t>
