      <t>In the present Internet Standards Process, stable identifiers forstandards, as distinct from documents (for which RFC numbers aresufficient), has become problematic because proportionately fewdocuments reach Full Standard and are assigned STD numbers. Severalproposals have been introduced into NEWTRK to address this problem,but only in the context of trying to resolve a number of otherissues. In the hope of making some progress on this dimension, thisdocument proposes a change to the standards-track document identifiersystem only.</t>
