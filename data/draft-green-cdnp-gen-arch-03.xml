    <abstract>
      <t>There is wide interest in the technology for interconnecting Content Networks, variously called 'Content Peering' or 'Content Internetworking'. We present the general architecture and core building blocks used in the internetworking of Content Networks. The scope of this work is limited to external interconnections with Content Networks and does not address internal mechanisms used within Content Networks, which for the purpose of the document are considered to be black boxes. This work establishes an abstract architectural framework to be used in the development of protocols, interfaces, and system models for standardized Content Internetworking.</t>
