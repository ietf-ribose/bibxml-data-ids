      <t>This document specifies a fast mechanism for protecting pseudowires (PWs) against egress endpoint failures, including egress attachment circuit failure, egress PE failure, multi-segment PW terminating PE failure, and multi-segment PW switching PE failure. Designed on the basis of multi-homed CE, PW redundancy, upstream label assignment and context specific label switching, the mechanism enables local repair to be performed by a router upstream adjacent to a failure. In particular, the router can restore PW traffic in the order of tens of milliseconds, by transmitting the traffic to a protector through a pre-established bypass tunnel. Therefore, the mechanism can be used to reduce traffic loss before a global repair mechanism reacts to the failure or the network converges on the topology changes due to the failure.</t>
