      <t>One basic model for IETF operations is that the IESG is given generalguidance in specific procedural documents but sufficient discretionand flexibility to adapt the rules and make new ones in order to makethe IETF work smoothly. This model underlies a number of reformproposals, including recent ones from this author. However, therehas been an undercurrent of suspicion from some members of thecommunity -- suspicion that the IESG is abusive of that discretionand cannot be trusted. Those suspicions have, to some extent, beenreinforced by questions about IESG-adopted procedures that seem tocontradict procedures approved by the community and documented inBCPs. The community cannot move forward with models based on bothtrust and distrust in the IESG's ability, and level ofresponsibility, to do its job. In an attempt to focus this part ofthe debate, this document proposes to dramatically narrow IESG'sscope of authority and discretion.In particular, it proposes to move the IESG, procedurally, onto an 'anything not explicitly required is forbidden' model, and, indeed, avery narrow and punitive member of that family. While the authorbelieves this would be a terrible idea, it appears to be time thatthe community either focuses on it and moves in this direction orstops wasting time hinting about it.</t>
