      <t>IPsec Virtual Private Network (VPN) is widely used by enterprises to interconnect their geographical dispersed branch office locations across IP Wide Area Network (WAN). To fully utilize the bandwidth available in IP WAN, load balancing of traffic between different IPsec VPN sites over Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP) and/or Link Aggregation Group (LAG) within IP WAN is attractive to those enterprises deploying IPsec VPN solutions. This document defines a method to encapsulate IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) packets inside UDP packets for improving load-balancing of IPsec tunneled traffic. In addition, this encapsulation is also applicable to some special multi-tenant data center network environment where the overlay tunnels need to be secured.</t>
