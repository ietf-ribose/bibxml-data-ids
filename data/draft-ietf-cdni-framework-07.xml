      <t>This document presents a framework for Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI). The purpose of the framework is to provide an overall picture of the problem space of CDNI and to describe the relationships among the various components necessary to interconnect CDNs. CDN Interconnection requires the specification of interfaces and mechanisms to address issues such as request routing, distribution metadata exchange, and logging information exchange across CDNs. The intent of this document is to outline what each interface needs to accomplish, and to describe how these interfaces and mechanisms fit together, while leaving their detailed specification to other documents. It obsoletes RFC 3466.</t>
