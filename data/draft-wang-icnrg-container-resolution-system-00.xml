      <t>We illustrate the architecture and mechanism of container resolution system, and to the protocol of resolving containers in ICN. The fundamental characters are:1)Use Interest and Data packet as the communication primitives, 2)Every routing node has FIB, CS, PIT tables to do packet routing and caching. Current NDN/CCN architecture does not require a resolution system. The routing is totally based on prefixes of content names, which causes scalability and mobility issues described in [Cisco-Name]. This draft addresses the aforementioned issues.</t>
