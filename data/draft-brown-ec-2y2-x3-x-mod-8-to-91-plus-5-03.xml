      <t>This document recommends using a special elliptic curve alongside dissimilar curves, such as NIST P-256, Curve25519, sect283k1, Brainpool, and random curves, as a cryptographic defense against an unlikely, undisclosed attack against mainstream curves. Features of this curve 2y^2=x^3+x/GF(8^91+5) are: isomorphism to Miller curves from 1985; Montgomery form mappable to Edwards; simple field powering for inversion, Legendre symbol, and square roots; efficient endomorphism to speed up Diffie--Hellman with Bernstein's 2-D ladder; 34-byte keys; similarity to Bitcoin curve; hashing-to-point; low Kolmogorov complexity (low risk of backdoor).</t>
