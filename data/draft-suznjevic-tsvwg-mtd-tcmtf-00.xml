    <abstract>
      <t>This document contains recommendations of maximum tolerable delays to be added by methods which improve bandwidth utilization through compression, multiplexing, and tunneling over a network path. Recommendations are presented only for real-time network services for which such bandwidth optimization techniques are applicable (i.e., services with low payload size to header size ratio).</t>
