    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines extensions for X.509 certificates to include attestation results as part of the certificate's content. The primary use case for these extensions is in the context of Certificate Signing Request (CSR) attestation, where claims about the trustworthiness of an Attester are conveyed to the Certification Authority (CA) as part of the CSR process. These extensions enable the CA to appraise the submitted evidence and embed attestation results into the issued certificate. This allows Relying Parties to evaluate the Attester's trustworthiness consistently and efficiently, supporting scalable policies for verification in environments with diverse attestation technologies.</t>
