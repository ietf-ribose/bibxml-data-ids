    <abstract>
      <t>The DANE specification (RFC 6698) describes how to use TLSA resource records in the DNS to associate a server's host name with its TLS certificate. The association is secured with DNSSEC. Some application protocols use SRV records (RFC 2782) to indirectly name the server hosts for a service domain (SMTP uses MX records for the same purpose). This specification gives generic instructions for how these application protocols locate and use TLSA records when technologies such as SRV records are used. Separate documents give the details that are specific to particular application protocols.</t>
