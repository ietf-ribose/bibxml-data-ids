      <t>This document describes an extension to the Session InitiationProtocol (SIP) [1] . The purpose of this extension is to providean extremely generic and extensible framework through which SIPnodes can request additional services from remote nodes. Examples ofsuch nodes include SIP Network Servers, SIP User Agents, SIP/PSTNGateways, SIP/H.323 Gateways and SIP Enabled Application ServiceBrokers. It also a candidate for providing a remote procedure callmechanism for Call Processing Language (CPL) scripts [2] .This proposal is based upon a new SIP method, called SERVICE. TheSERVICE method can carry a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) [3]message as it's payload. SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchangeof information in a decentralized, distributed environment. SOAPdefines a framework for encoding request and response messages inXML. Typically SOAP uses HTTP as a transport protocol but thisproposal enables SIP to be used instead.</t>
