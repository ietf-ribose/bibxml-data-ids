      <t>This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1] . The purpose of this extension is to provide an extremely generic and extensible framework through which SIP nodes can request additional services from remote nodes. Examples of such nodes include SIP Network Servers, SIP User Agents, SIP/PSTN Gateways, SIP/H.323 Gateways and SIP Enabled Application Service Brokers. It also a candidate for providing a remote procedure call mechanism for Call Processing Language (CPL) scripts [2] . This proposal is based upon a new SIP method, called SERVICE. The SERVICE method can carry a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) [3] message as it's payload. SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a decentralized, distributed environment. SOAP defines a framework for encoding request and response messages in XML. Typically SOAP uses HTTP as a transport protocol but this proposal enables SIP to be used instead.</t>
