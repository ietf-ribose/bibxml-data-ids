      <t>An email address has two parts - local part and domain part - separated by "@" sign. This document describes a basic solution to internationalized email address (IMA) and includes some preliminary survey results. The proposed solution enables SMTP servers to support IMA. The solution discussed in this document is immediately deployable by interested parties without affecting or breaking any other existing systems.</t>
