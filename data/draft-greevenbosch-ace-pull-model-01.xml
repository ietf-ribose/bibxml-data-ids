    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defines a protocol which enables resource constrained nodes to perform authentication and authorization operations in a constrained environment. By using this protocol, a resource constrained node can delegate the authentication of communication peers and management of authorization information to a trusted third party with less severe limitations regarding processing power and memory. This specification is based on the pull model architecture.</t>
