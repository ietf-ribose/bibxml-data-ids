      <t>CoAP has been standardised as an application-level REST-based protocol. When multiple transport protocols exist for exchanging CoAP resource representations, this document introduces a way forward for CoAP endpoints as well as intermediaries to agree upon alternate transport and protocol configurations as well as URIs for CoAP messaging. 2 mechanisms are proposed: The first by extending the CoRE Resource Directory with new parameter types and the second, by introducing a new CoAP Option with which clients can interact directly with servers without needing the Resource Directory.</t>
