      <t>Network level security bootstrapping and joining device level security bootstrapping mechanisms are described in this document. They are proposed for security bootstrapping of the Internet of Things networks, which implement IETF protocols (e.g. 6LoWPAN, 6lo, RPL, AODV, DSR) over IEEE 802.15.4. The network level security bootstrapping is useful at the very beginning of a newly deployed IoT network. It automatically and hierarchically adds all the devices to security domain and helps establish security communication. The joining device level security bootstrapping provides comprehensive mechanism for different IoT devices joining an existing IoT network.</t>
