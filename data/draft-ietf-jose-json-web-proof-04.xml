    <abstract>
      <t>The JOSE set of standards established JSON-based container formats for Keys, Signatures, and Encryption. They also established IANA registries to enable the algorithms and representations used for them to be extended. Since those were created, newer cryptographic algorithms that support selective disclosure and unlinkability have matured and started seeing early market adoption. This document defines a new container format similar in purpose and design to JSON Web Signature (JWS) called a _JSON Web Proof (JWP)_. Unlike JWS, which integrity-protects only a single payload, JWP can integrity-protect multiple payloads in one message. It also specifies a new presentation form that supports selective disclosure of individual payloads, enables additional proof computation, and adds a protected header to prevent replay.</t>
