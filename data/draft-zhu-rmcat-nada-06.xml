    <abstract>
      <t>Network-Assisted Dynamic Adaptation (NADA) is a novel congestion control scheme for interactive real-time media applications, such as video conferencing. In NADA, the sender regulates its sending rate based on either implicit or explicit congestion signaling in a consistent manner. As one example of explicit signaling, NADA can benefit from explicit congestion notification (ECN) markings from network nodes. It also maintains consistent sender behavior in the absence of explicit signaling by reacting to queuing delay and packet loss. This document describes the overall system architecture for NADA, as well as recommended behavior at the sender and the receiver.</t>
