      <t>Problem definition for route leaks and enumeration of types of route leaks are provided in [RFC7908]. This document describes a new well- known Large Community that provides a way for route leak prevention, detection, and mitigation. The configuration process for this Community can be automated with the methodology for setting BGP roles that is described in ietf-idr-bgp-open-policy draft.</t>
