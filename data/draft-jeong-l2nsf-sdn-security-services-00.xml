      <t>This document provides requirements for security services based on software-defined networking (SDN) with two representative use cases: (i) centralized firewall system for intra-domain networks and (ii) centralized DDoS-attack mitigation system between inter-domain networks. For the centralized firewall system, this document raises challenging issues in existing firewalls and a use case of centralized firewall system based on SDN. For the centralized DDoS- attack mitigation system, this document also raises challenging issues in existing DDoS-attack mitigation techniques and a use case of centralized DDoS-attack mitigation system based on SDN.</t>
