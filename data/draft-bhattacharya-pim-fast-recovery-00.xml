      <t>When a PIM router reboots, either because of uncontrolled failover or because of ISSU, it needs to reconcile the PIM entries. For this, rebooting router sends PIM hello with new GenId. In reponse, neighbors send a new hello and replay PIM J/P message. Regardless an application maintaing full mroute states, the rebooting route must wait for this replay to complete only after which it can mark the oif reconciliation complete. This process is undeterministic today. This draft proposes a new mechanism to achieve a faster reconcilaition time. For this a new Hello option and a new message type has been introduced.</t>
