      <t>This document describes mappings of IETF Integrated Services onto IETF differentiated services networks. These mappings allow appropriately engineered and configured differentiated service network clouds to play the role of 'network elements' in the Integrated Services framework, and thus to be used as components of an overall end-to-end Integrated Services QoS solution.</t>
