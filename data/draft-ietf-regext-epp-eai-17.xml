      <t>This document describes an EPP command-response extension that permits usage of Internationalized Email Addresses in the EPP protocol and specifies the terms when it can be used by EPP clients and servers. The Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP), being developed before the standards for SMTPUTF8 compliant addresses, does not support such email addresses. TO BE REMOVED on turning to RFC: The document is edited in the dedicated github repo (https://github.com/beldmit/eppeai). Please send your submissions via GitHub.</t>
