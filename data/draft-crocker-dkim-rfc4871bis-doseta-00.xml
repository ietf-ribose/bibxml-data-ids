      <t>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) permits a person, role, ororganization that owns the signing domain to claim someresponsibility for a message by associating the domain with themessage. This can be an author's organization, an operational relayor one of their agents. DKIM separates the question of the identityof the signer of the message from the purported author of themessage. Assertion of responsibility is validated through acryptographic signature and querying the signer's domain directly toretrieve the appropriate public key. Message transit from author torecipient is through relays that typically make no substantive changeto a message or its content and thus preserve the DKIM signature.</t>
