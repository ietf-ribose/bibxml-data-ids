      <t>Ethernet does not scale well to large networks. The flat MAC addressspace, whilst having obvious benefits for the user and administrator,is the primary cause of this poor scalability; other recent effortsto improve upon Ethernet's scalability have addressed symptoms,rather than this underlying cause. MOOSE, Multi-level Origin-Organised Scalable Ethernet, is an Ethernet switch architecture thatperforms in-place rewriting of MAC addresses in order to impose ahierarchy upon the address space without reconfiguration ormodification of connected devices. This removes the need forswitches to maintain large forwarding databases, is of direct use inimplementing improved routing, and allows for a variety of otherscalability and security innovations. MOOSE also includes aglobally-scalable, distributed and resilient protocol for theautomatic assignment of addresses to switches, and for detecting andcheaply resolving addressing conflicts.</t>
