      <t>The packet loss rate of each path between the source node and destination node can be obtained through two methods, one is direct measurement, another approach is proposed in this document calculating the packet loss rate based on the flow sensing parameter. The core idea of the calculating approach is the flow sensing parameter, which can be used to calculate the packet loss rate of each path between the source node and destination node and select the path whose packet loss rate is smallest to be the data transmission path.</t>
