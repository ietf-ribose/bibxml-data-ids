      <t>The packet loss rate of each path between the source node anddestination node can be obtained through two methods, one is directmeasurement, another approach is proposed in this documentcalculating the packet loss rate based on the flow sensing parameter.The core idea of the calculating approach is the flow sensingparameter, which can be used to calculate the packet loss rate ofeach path between the source node and destination node and select thepath whose packet loss rate is smallest to be the data transmissionpath.</t>
