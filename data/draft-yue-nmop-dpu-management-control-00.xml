    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a DPU-based bare metal management solution to address inefficiencies in management and resource utilization associated with traditional bare metal deployments. The core idea of this solution is to leverage the DPU's high-performance processing and network acceleration capabilities, transforming traditional network/resource management into a DPU-centric control model. This not only simplifies bare-metal operations but achieves unified management across virtualized and physical environments through a consolidated framework.</t>
