      <t>This paper discusses H.323 communication as it is being developed andimplemented within the context of today's Internet (I1 and I2). As such it suggests a model that the authors believe can be developed using current thinking, protocols, and practices. It is also intended to support a vision for future communication development that will allow multi-mode communication to become more universally useful for end-users while becoming more sophisticated and reliable in its technological foundation.The authors see the concepts emerging within and around the development of the H.323 standard as some of the most promising today for enablingInternet-extensible multi-mode global communication. After a briefpresentation of a communication model, several problems and concerns with the present state of H.323 communication are presented along with specific recommendations for changes in these areas.</t>
