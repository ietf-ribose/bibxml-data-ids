      <t>This document describes the goals of Voice Profile for Internet Mail (VPIM), Version 3 and establishes a baseline of desired functionality against which proposed MIME profiles for Internet voice messaging can be judged. The primary goal for this version is to support interoperability with desktop clients. Other goals for this version of VPIM include backward compatibility, expanded interoperability with unified messaging systems, and conformance to Internet standards. This document does not include goals that were met fully by VPIM version 2 [VPIM2]. Different levels of desirability are indicated throughout the document.</t>
