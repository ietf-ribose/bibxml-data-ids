      <t>There is a challenge of providing IPv6 multihoming sites with the basic benefits such as redundancy and load sharing, and at the same time, scaling the global IPv6 routing table. It is equally challenging to provide a solution which is simple enough to be operational manageable. This document proposes a simple solution which meets the requirements and is also operationally manageable.</t>
