      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing Policy Client devices, including the relationship between device interfaces and policy role combinations. Policy role combinations are used as part of the data model for policy information when a Policy Client is provisioned using the COPS protocol [COPS-PR] and a Policy Information Base (PIB) [FRAMEPIB].</t>
