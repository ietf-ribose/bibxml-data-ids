      <t>The Short Message Service (SMS) and Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) of mobile cellular networks is frequently used in Machine-To-Machine (M2M) communications, such as for telematic devices. The service offers small packet sizes and high delays just as other typical low-power and lossy networks (LLNs), i.e. 6LoWPANs. The design of the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), that took the limitations of LLNs into account, is thus also applicable to telematic M2M devices. The adaptation of CoAP to the SMS or USSD transport mechanisms and the combination with IP transported over cellular networks is described in this document.</t>
