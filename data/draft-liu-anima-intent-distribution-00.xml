      <t>This document describes the requirements of distributing intent information in an autonomic network. Ideally, the intent may be generated/injected at an arbitrary autonomic node and be distributed among the whole autonomic domain. Then this document resolves the distribution requirements into protocol design requirements. Specifically, this document introduces a solution which is some extension based on the Anima signalling protocol (GDNP, Generic Discovery and Negotiation Protocol).</t>
