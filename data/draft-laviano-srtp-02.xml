      <t>This memo describes a protocol for selectively reliable transmission of Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) data in a wide-area multicast environment. The Selectively Reliable Transmission Protocol (SRTP) operates in three distinct modes: best-effort multicast, reliable multicast using negative acknowledgements with a NAK suppression mechanism to avoid congestion at the sender, and lightweight reliable transaction-oriented unicast. SRTP is designed to run in user space and form a sublayer between applications and the kernel-level Internet protocol stack.</t>
