    <abstract>
      <t>OSPF is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used in IP networks. Routers find new and detect unreachable neighbors via Hello subprotocol. Hello OSPF packets are also used to ensure two-way connectivity within time. When a router restarts its OSPF software, it may not know its neighbors. If such a router sends a hello packet on an interface, its neighbors are going to reset the adjacency, which may not be desirable in certain conditions. This memo provides a mechanism that allows OSPF routers to inform their neighbors about the restart process. Note that this mechanism requires support from neighboring routers.</t>
