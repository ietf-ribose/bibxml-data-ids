    <abstract>
      <t>Privacy protection is the bigger and bigger concern of many governments and public in general. ND has a few open man-in-the- middle attack vectors. MITM is considered among the most dangerous attack types because of information leakage. This document proposes minimal modifications for ND to protect IPv6 nodes against still open MITM attacks. It could be implemented gradually on any nodes, with the biggest benefit from support on routers.</t>
