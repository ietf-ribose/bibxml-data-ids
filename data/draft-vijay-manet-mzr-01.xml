    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a multicast protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc networks, called the Multicast routing protocol based on Zone Routing (MZR). MZR is a source-initiated on-demand protocol, in which a multicast delivery tree is created using a concept based on the zone routing mechanism. It belongs to the family of source-tree-based protocols, in which a delivery tree rooted at the source is created for each active multicast session. MZR does not depend on any underlying unicast protocol for a global routing substructure. The protocol's reaction to topological changes is restricted to a node's neighborhood and is not propagated throughout the network.</t>
