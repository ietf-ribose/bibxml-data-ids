      <t>This document proposes a multicast protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc networks,called the Multicast routing protocol based on Zone Routing (MZR). MZRis a source-initiated on-demand protocol, in which a multicast deliverytree is created using a concept based on the zone routing mechanism.It belongs to the family of source-tree-based protocols, in which adelivery tree rooted at the source is created for each active multicastsession. MZR does not depend on any underlying unicast protocol for aglobal routing substructure. The protocol's reaction to topologicalchanges is restricted to a node's neighborhood and is not propagatedthroughout the network.</t>
