      <t>This Internet Draft describes the Universal Packet Driver Protocol (UPDP). This protocol is intended to provide a standardized method for a device to communicate its interface information. It is a protocol based on extending ICMP [1] within the bounds of the original intention of ICMP. The protocol can be used by any device to send and receive device interface information.</t>
