    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a bundle of DKIM (RFC 6376) adjustments and extensions. They do not hinder the currently distributed processing environment that includes DKIM, ARC, DMARC and SPF, and are as such backward compatible. Their aim is however to ultimately slim down the email environment that needs to be administrated and maintained, by establishing mutual agreements in between sender and receiver(s), verifiable through public-key cryptography, and let the SMTP protocol handle decisions only based upon that.</t>
