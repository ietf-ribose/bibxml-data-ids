      <t>This draft provides an example of how to extend the ACE framework [I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz], to use client and server certificates (x509), for mutual authentication. Certificate are used to establish the security context between the client and resource server. This draft is limited to transport layer security based on DTLS and it does not consider the mixed case where e.g. only the server is authenticated with a certificate.</t>
