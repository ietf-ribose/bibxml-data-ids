    <abstract>
      <t>An analysis is performed on the advantages and disadvantages for provision of Location Information (LI) by-reference in the GEOPRIV architecture. The concept of a Location URI, that is, a URI that references LI, is introduced. A number of usage patterns for Location URIs are discussed, particularly with regard to addressing mobility. Security concerns that are introduced by Location URIs are also considered.</t>
