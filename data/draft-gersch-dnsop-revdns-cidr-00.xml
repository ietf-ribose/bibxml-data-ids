      <t>The current reverse DNS naming method is used to specify a complete IP address. It has not been used to handle address ranges; for example, there is no formal mechanism for specifying a reverse DNS name for the block of addresses specified by the IPv4 prefix 129.82.0.0/16. Defining such a reverse DNS naming convention would be useful for a number of applications. These include applications for secure BGP routing, and applications that need host-information for a device owning a complete IPv6 address block. This draft proposes a naming convention for encoding CIDR address blocks in the reverse DNS.</t>
