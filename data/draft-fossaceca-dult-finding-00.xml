      <t>Lightweight location tracking tags are in wide use to allow users to locate items. These tags function as a component of a crowdsourced tracking network in which devices belonging to other network users (e.g., phones) report which tags they see and their location, thus allowing the owner of the tag to determine where their tag was most recently seen. This document defines the protocol by which devices report tags they have seen and by which owners look up their location.</t>
