      <t>This document specifies the requirement of lightweight authentication and key agreement protocols for Internet of Things (LAKAPIoT). The authentication and key agreement protocols are very crucial for IoT since it can prevent unauthorized or malicious IoT devices from accessing the network. However, most IoT devices have limited storage, computing and communication capacity. Moreover, the network archi- tecture of IoT is very different from the traditional network. Therefore, designing authentication and key agreement protocols for IoT is an essential step to ensure its security. In this draft, the requirement of lightweight authentication and key agreement protocols for IoT is proposed.</t>
