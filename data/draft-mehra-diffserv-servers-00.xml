      <t>This draft motivates and presents architectural considerations for Differentiated Services [DSARCH] support in servers (referred to as DiffServ servers). We discuss possible deployment scenarios for Differentiated and Integrated Services, and highlight the benefits of supporting DiffServ functions on servers. We outline the requirements for DiffServ-enabled servers and propose a policy-based architecture that allows IntServ and DiffServ functions to coexist on DiffServ servers. We then propose a DiffServ API that can be used by applications to influence installed system policies on an application-specific basis, and can serve as a candidate for standardization. We also describe a number of host-specific DiffServ functions that can be efficiently supported on servers.</t>
