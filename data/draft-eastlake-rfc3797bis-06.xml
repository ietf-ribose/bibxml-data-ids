      <t>This document describes a method for making random selections in such a way as to promote public confidence in the unbiased nature of the choice. This method is referred to in this document as "verifiable selection". It focuses on the selection of the voting members of the IETF Nominations Committee (NomCom) from the pool of eligible volunteers; however, similar techniques could be and have been applied to other selections. It provdes an optional extension for multiple rounds of such selection that can be induced by earlier selectees without compromising the unpredictable nature of the selections. This document obsoletes RFC 3797.</t>
