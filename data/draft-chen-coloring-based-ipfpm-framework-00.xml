      <t>By setting one unused bit of the IP header of packets to "color" the packets into different color blocks, it naturally gives a way to measure the real packet loss and delay without inserting any extra OAM packets. This is called coloring based IP performance measurement. This document specifies a framework and protocol for this "coloring" based IP performance measurement.</t>
