      <t>This internet-draft describes a protocol with an addressing scheme where members of the internet are addressed by their physical addresses and by an implementing internet router that can contact them. The packets sent by the protocol include handshake messages, client data, and the status of the data being sent. A routing procedure is suggested according to special addresses that carry information about the region of a router.</t>
