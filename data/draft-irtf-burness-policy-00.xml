      <t>When considering a new routing system, we need to ensure that it isable to meet the functionality requirements of the participantnetworks. One aspect that is frequently over-looked is that routingis rarely a simple matter of choosing a least-hop path. Thisdocument attempts to highlight some of the more common policy choicesthat are made. We expect that policies that are in common use todayshould be easy to implement with any new routing schemes.
