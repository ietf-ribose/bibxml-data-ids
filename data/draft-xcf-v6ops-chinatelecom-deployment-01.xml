      <t>With the depletion of the IPv4 address space, large-scale SPs are now faced with the real option to deploy IPv6 in a timely manner. In order to achieve smooth transition to IPv6, migration tools should be introduced for different deployment models. Among different IPv6 transition mechanisms, MAP-T is a stateless translation method which can directly translate IPv4 packet to IPv6 packet. This document describes the challenges and requirements for large SP to deploy IPv6 in operational network, the experimental results of MAP-T in our laboratory and the field trials in large SP operational network.</t>
