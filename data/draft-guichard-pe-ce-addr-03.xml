      <t>This document proposes to allocate a block of globally unique IPv4 addresses for the exclusive use of Service Providers that provide [L3VPN] based Services. The Service Provider may use these addresses for the provisioning of IP addresses to the links that connect Customer Edge (CE) routers with Provider Edge (PE) routers (PE-CE links), and/or for the IP addressing of attached CE routers. The main motivation for this proposal is to simplify the Service Providers' operations in the scenario where they monitor PE-CE links, and/or CE-routers, while at the same time conserving IPv4 address space. This addressing scheme is not intended for use by VPNs that span more than one Service Provider, unless co-operation of addressing structure is maintained to ensure uniqueness of addresses between providers. Furthermore, although the main reference within this draft is related to services provided by [L3VPN], the recommendations formulated herein may also apply to other Layer-2 or Layer-3 VPN architectures.</t>
