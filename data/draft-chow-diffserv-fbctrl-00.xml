      <t>This draft presents a Feedback Control extension to DifferentiatedServices. Differentiated Services have been designed for scalabilitythrough handling aggregates of traffic instead of individual flows asin the Integrated Services. However, it has been observed that the DSmechanism in some situations can hardly achieve the desired quality ofservice and may result in unfair conditions. To remedy theseproblems, this draft describes a general feedback control paradigmthat enables a network provider to impose a control mechanism upontheir DS domain. As an instance of the general framework, a feedbackcontrol mechanism is proposed. Our simulation analysis demonstratesthat the overall feedback controlled DS can offer a better resourceutilisation and a fair resource sharing. Such control mechanism canalso help enforce the desired service assurances. This document isintended to stimulate discussion in this direction. Further work isrequired to carefully define a set of primitive requirements thatenables interoperability. The pdf and ps version of this document are available at:http://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~keith/ietf-id/draft-chow-diffserv-fbctrl-00.pdf,.ps and recommended for the figures it contains.</t>
