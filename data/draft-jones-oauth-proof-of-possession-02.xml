      <t>This specification defines how to express a declaration in a JSON Web Token (JWT) that the presenter of the JWT possesses a particular key and that the recipient can cryptographically confirm proof-of- possession of the key by the presenter. This property is also sometimes described as the presenter being a holder-of-key.</t>
