      <t>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), in particular patents areimportant for standards development organizations (SDOs). A patentgrants a monopoly to the owner to control the usage of the coveredtechnology. If such a technology is becoming part of a standard thepatent owner can arbitrarily restrict the usage of the standard.Therefore all SDOs are concerned about patents in their standards.This memo focuses on practices the IETF may apply to cope with patentrights in its standards. The proposal is based on the idea of openstandards and is fully aligned to the current IPR rules of the IETF.The intention is to retain the mind of the IETF while enabling theconsideration of IPR covered proposals in a defined way.</t>
