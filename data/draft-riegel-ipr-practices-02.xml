      <t>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR), in particular patents are important for standards development organizations (SDOs). A patent grants a monopoly to the owner to control the usage of the covered technology. If such a technology is becoming part of a standard the patent owner can arbitrarily restrict the usage of the standard. Therefore all SDOs are concerned about patents in their standards. This memo focuses on practices the IETF may apply to cope with patent rights in its standards. The proposal is based on the idea of open standards and is fully aligned to the current IPR rules of the IETF. The intention is to retain the mind of the IETF while enabling the consideration of IPR covered proposals in a defined way.</t>
