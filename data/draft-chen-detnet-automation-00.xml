      <t>This document offers a comprehensive overview of deterministic networks, elucidating their significance, key characteristics, and the challenges they address in comparison to non-deterministic counterparts. With a focus on Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Precision Time Protocol (PTP), the technological aspects are explored, encompassing synchronization mechanisms, traffic shaping, and security considerations. Real-world applications in industrial automation, control systems, and multimedia streaming underscore the practical relevance of deterministic networks. The document emphasizes the importance of precise time synchronization, security measures, and collaboration within the networking community. Through acknowledgments, the collaborative efforts of the Deterministic Networking (DetNet) Working Group, authors of relevant standards, and the broader community are recognized, highlighting the collective dedication to advancing deterministic networking technologies.</t>
