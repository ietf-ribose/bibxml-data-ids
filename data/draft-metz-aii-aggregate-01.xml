      <t>[PWE3 Control] defines the signaling mechanisms for establishing point-to-point pseudowires between two provider edge (PE) nodes. The Generalized ID FEC element contained in PWE3 signaling protocols include TLV fields that identify pseudowire endpoints called attachment individual identifiers (AII). This document defines an AII structure in the form of new AII type-length-value fields that supports AII aggregation for improved scalability. It is envisioned that this would be useful in large inter-domain virtual private wire service networks where pseudowires are established between selected local and remote PE nodes based on customer need.</t>
