    <abstract>
      <t>The development of two explicit routing protocols RSVP-TE[RSVP-TE] and CR-LDP[CR-LDP] within MPLS has created the need to allow interworking between the two MPLS. Explict routed (ER) label switch paths do not have a prior knowledge of the ER signaling method in use within the various links comprising a domain. In an integrated environment an ER path may crisscross between RSVP-TE and CR-LDP nodes numerous times. This document describes the procedures for the establishment of an RSVP-TE originated LSP transiting or terminating within a CR-LDP domain and the procedures for the establishment of a CR-LDP originated LSP terminating within an RSVP-TE domain.</t>
