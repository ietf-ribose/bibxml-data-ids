      <t>This document captures experience in implementing systems based on the ENUM protocol, and experience of ENUM data that have been created by others. As such, it is informational only, and produced as a help to others in reporting what is 'out there' and the potential pitfalls in interpreting the set of documents that specify the protocol.</t>
