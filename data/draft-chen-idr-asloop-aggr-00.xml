      <t>Currently an BGP aggregate may be denied or excluded by the AS loop detection mechanism when a more specific, contributing route contains the local AS number. To help enhance network robustness and simplify network operations, in this document we propose that the AS loop detection be relaxed for aggregates with an AS_SET path segment.</t>
