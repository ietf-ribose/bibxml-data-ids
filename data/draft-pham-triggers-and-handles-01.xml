      <t>This document describes a communication mechanism named 'triggers and handles' between service logic and network elements. The concept defines a trigger as a notification that a network element sends to the service logic. A handle is defined as a command that the service logic sends to a network element. Triggers are bound to network events and allow network elements to notify service logic of occurring events in the network whereas handles allow taking control of network elements.</t>
