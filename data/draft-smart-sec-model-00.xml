      <t>The first step in creating a secure Internet is to build a model of the security requirements of the real world entities involved and how those real world entities act on the Internet through the agency of networked computers. This document presents a minimal model as a starting point for discussion. In this model: o The real world is composed of entities, each being: (a) an independent legal entity; or (b) a sub-entity of another entity (creating a multi-level hierarchy). o Running code is characterized by: (a) the entity that it acts on behalf of; and (b) the entity that controls the environment in which the code executes. o The environment can run on a bare unmanaged machine or it can be a virtual environment which is code controlled by another entity. o We can model communication between machines as a sequence of requests and assertions. The security question becomes: which requests to honour. What is known about the provenance of the requests and assertions is typically crucial. o Security can take place at different network layers and security information must be passed between the layers along with the data.</t>
