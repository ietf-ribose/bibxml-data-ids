      <t>The first step in creating a secure Internet is to build a model ofthe security requirements of the real world entities involved andhow those real world entities act on the Internet through the agencyof networked computers. This document presents a minimal model as astarting point for discussion. In this model: o The real world is composed of entities, each being: (a) anindependent legal entity; or (b) a sub-entity of another entity(creating a multi-level hierarchy).o Running code is characterized by: (a) the entity that it acts onbehalf of; and (b) the entity that controls the environment inwhich the code executes.o The environment can run on a bare unmanaged machine or it can bea virtual environment which is code controlled by another entity.o We can model communication between machines as a sequence ofrequests and assertions. The security question becomes: whichrequests to honour. What is known about the provenance of therequests and assertions is typically crucial.o Security can take place at different network layers and securityinformation must be passed between the layers along with the data.</t>
