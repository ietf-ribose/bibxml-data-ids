      <t>This memo first gives a brief review of a RSVP and Mobile IPv6 interoperation framework proposed in [1] and compared its features with the Performance Requirements set forth by Requirements of a QoS Solution for Mobile IP [2]. The subsequent part of the memo presents specification details including message formats, processing rules and algorithms that form the framework. The vast majority of these specifications has been verified by a prototype implementation. It is expected that this work could serve as a useful input in dealing with NSIS protocol and mobility issue.</t>
