      <t>This memo first gives a brief review of a RSVP and Mobile IPv6interoperation framework proposed in [1] and compared its featureswith the Performance Requirements set forth by Requirements of a QoSSolution for Mobile IP [2]. The subsequent part of the memo presentsspecification details including message formats, processing rules andalgorithms that form the framework. The vast majority of thesespecifications has been verified by a prototype implementation. It isexpected that this work could serve as a useful input in dealing withNSIS protocol and mobility issue.</t>
