      <t>This document outlines a new approach, called NGISec, for end-to-endsecure communication system that is compatible with other networkingprotocols. Such a solution is needed because IPSec is incompatiblewith network address translation (NAT), ICMP, and QoS protocols suchas differentiated services, RSVP, RED, and ECN. Most of the proposedsolutions to mitigate or remove the incompatibility problems ofIPSec only address a small sub-section of the problems, and proposedsolutions have severe drawbacks. By using our proposed approach, onecan achieve end-to-end secure communication in LANs, VPNs, andnetwork-to-network connections. This approach can be viewed as analternative to IPSec that solves the severe problems faced by IPSecand paves the way for simultaneous use of security and QoS services.While it is aimed to be an alternative to IPSec, it re-uses criticalcomponents of the IPSec infrastructure such as the Internet keyexchange (IKE). An interesting aspect of the proposed protocol isthat it also allows the use of SSL/TLS to build VPNs.</t>
