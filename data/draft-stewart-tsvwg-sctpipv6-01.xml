    <abstract>
      <t>Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC2960] provides transparent multi-homing to its upper layer users. This multi-homing is accomplished through the passing of address parameters in the initial setup message used by SCTP. In an IPv4 network all addresses are passed with no consideration for their scope and routeablility. In a IPv6 network special considerations MUST be made to properly bring up associations between SCTP endpoints that have IPv6 [RFC2460] addresses bound within their association. This document defines those considerations and enumerates general rules that an SCTP endpoint MUST use in formulating both the INIT and INIT-ACK chunks.</t>
