      <t>Stream Control Transmission Protocol [RFC2960] provides transparentmulti-homing to its upper layer users. This multi-homing isaccomplished through the passing of address parameters in theinitial setup message used by SCTP. In an IPv4 network all addressesare passed with no consideration for their scope and routeablility.In a IPv6 network special considerations MUST be made to properlybring up associations between SCTP endpoints that have IPv6[RFC2460] addresses bound within their association. This documentdefines those considerations and enumerates general rulesthat an SCTP endpoint MUST use in formulating both the INIT andINIT-ACK chunks.</t>
