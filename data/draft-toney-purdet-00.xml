      <t>Originally this draft started out as 'Reliable Extensions To UDP'. Instead of calling it 'Reliable Extensions To UDP', it was decided to use an anagram, PURDET, to represent what this draft was about. This PURDET specification defines a very lightweight protocol with minimal transport functions necessary to provide reliability and flow control over non-reliable UDP transport. It is intended to be very easy to implement, to have a small footprint on the OS to allow high fan-out, and support simple control of the connection. PURDET supports sequencing, flow control, multiplexing/protocol identification (using an optional field), error retransmission, and link loss detection. PURDET is a work in progress presented for comment. The author hopes this represents positive progress towards a reliability approach appropriate to the needs of real time control and similar applications.</t>
