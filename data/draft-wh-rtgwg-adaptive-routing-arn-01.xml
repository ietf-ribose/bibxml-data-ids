    <abstract>
      <t>Large-scale supercomputing and AI data centers utilize multipath to implement load balancing and improve link reliability. Adaptive routing (AR), widely used in direct topologies such as dragonfly, can dynamically adjust routing policies based on path congestion and failures. When congestion or failure occurs, the local node applies AR and also sends the congestion/failure information to other nodes in a timely and accurate manner to enforce AR on other nodes, thus avoiding exacerbating congestion on the path. This document specifies Adaptive Routing Notification (ARN) for proactively disseminating congestion detection and congestion elimination information.</t>
