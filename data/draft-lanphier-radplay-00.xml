      <t>This document defines RTP Archiving, Delivery, and Playback (RADPLAY) extensions for the Session Description Protocol (SDP, [RFC 2327]). These extensions provide a standard means of archiving and delivering RTP streams via HTTP, using SDP and the commonly used 'rtpdump' file format. As a result of its design, it also provides a way of delivering generic RTP streams over HTTP, thus making it a suitable replacement for approaches which rely on network-unfriendly mechanisms such as 'HTTP tunneling'.</t>
