      <t>The Internet is becoming an increasingly commercial arena in which payments are rendered for goods, information, and services. To support such commerce, various incompatible Internet payment protocols have been proposed or adopted by a variety of organizations. There appears to be little prospect of merger of all or abandonment of most of these protocols. A header syntax, the Universal Payment Preamble (UPP), is presented for parties to negotiate payment alternatives at any point in shopping, until a final hand-off to a particular chosen payment system. The chosen payment system, not UPP, is responsible for the security of any actual transmission of funds.</t>
