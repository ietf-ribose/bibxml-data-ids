    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides an informational discussion of the conceptual relationship between remote attestation, as defined by the RATS (Remote ATtestation ProcedureS) Working Group, and behavioral evidence recording mechanisms. It observes that attestation and behavioral evidence recording address fundamentally different verification questions and can serve as complementary layers in comprehensive system accountability frameworks. This document is purely descriptive and does not propose any modifications to RATS architecture, define new attestation mechanisms, or establish normative requirements.</t>
