      <t>This document provides recommendations and guidelines for RTP and RTCP in the context of SIPREC. This document exists as a standalone document to facilitate discussion of the RTP recommendations, and it is anticipated that portions of this document will be incorporated into [I-D.ietf-siprec-protocol] rather than this document itself being adopted as a working group document.</t>
