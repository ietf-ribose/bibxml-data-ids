      <t>The base MPEG2-TS splicing related protocols, i.e., Digital ProgramInsertion Splicing API [SCTE30] and Digital Program Insertion CueingMessage for Cable [SCTE35], only take into account how to insert thecontent (e.g., spot advertisements of various lengths, programsubstitution, public service announcements, etc) into any MPEG2-TSoutput multiplex on the splicer , as well as how to carrynotification of upcoming splicing and other timing information in thetransport stream, but not give enough mechanisms to direct theunderlying transport protocol such as RTP how to compatibly work withthe MPEG2-TS splicing. This memo highlights the issues of what's theimpact on RTP and RTCP when performing splicing between the primarychannel and the insertion channel.</t>
