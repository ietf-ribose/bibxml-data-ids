      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is a network based mobility management protocol that enables IP mobility for a host without requiring its participation in any mobility-related signaling. PMIPv6 requires all communications to go through the local mobility anchor. As this can be suboptimal, localized routing allows mobile nodes attached to the same or different mobile access gateways to exchange traffic by using localized forwarding or a direct tunnel between the gateways. This document proposes an initiation mechanism for localized routing.</t>
