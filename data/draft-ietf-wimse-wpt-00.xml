      <t>The WIMSE architecture defines authentication and authorization for software workloads in a variety of runtime environments, from basic deployments to complex multi-service, multi-cloud, multi-tenant systems. This document specifies the Workload Proof Token (WPT), a mechanism for workloads to prove possession of the private key associated with a Workload Identity Token (WIT). The WPT is a signed JWT that binds the workload's authentication to a specific HTTP request, providing application-level proof of possession for workload-to-workload communication. This specification is designed to work alongside the WIT credential format defined in draft-ietf- wimse-workload-creds and can be combined with other WIMSE protocols in multi-hop call chains.</t>
