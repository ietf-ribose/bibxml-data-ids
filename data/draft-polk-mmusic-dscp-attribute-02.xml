      <t>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer/answer model currently has no mechanism for dynamic configuration of the Differentiated Services Codepoints (DSCP) for the media streams endpoints establish. This document creates such a mechanism within SDP, as granular as at the media stream level where more than one stream can be in an offer/answer exchange, to set a particular DSCP for the desired Per Hop Behavior (PHB) of a media stream. This same mechanism can change a DSCP of an existing stream based on dynamic network conditions.</t>
