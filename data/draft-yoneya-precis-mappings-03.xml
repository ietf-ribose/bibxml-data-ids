      <t>Preparation and comparison of internationalized strings ("precis") framework [I-D.ietf-precis-framework] is defining several classes of strings for preparation and comparison. In the document, case mapping is defined because many of protocols handle case sensitive or case insensitive string comparison and therefore preparation of string is mandatory. As described in IDNA mapping [RFC5895] and precis problem statement [I-D.ietf-precis-problem-statement], mappings in internationalized strings are not limited to case, but also width, delimiters and/or other specials are taken into consideration. This document is a guideline for authors of protocol profiles of precis framework and describes the mappings that must be considered between receiving user input and passing permitted code points to internationalized protocols.</t>
