      <t>This specification proposes an update to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, to enhance the operation of IPv6 over wireless links that exhibit lossy multicast support, and enable a large degree of scalability by splitting the broadcast domains. A higher speed backbone federates multiple wireless links to form a large MultiLink Subnet. Backbone Routers acting as Layer-3 Access Point route packets to registered nodes, where an classical Layer-2 Access Point would bridge. Conversely, wireless nodes register or are proxy-registered to the Backbone Router to setup routing services in a fashion that is essentially similar to a classical Layer-2 association.</t>
