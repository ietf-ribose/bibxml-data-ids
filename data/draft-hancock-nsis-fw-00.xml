      <t>The NSIS working group is considering protocol developments in signaling for resources for a traffic flow along its path in the network. The requirements for such signaling are being developed in a separate document [2]; This Internet Draft proposes a framework for such signaling. This initial version provides a model for describing the entities that take part in the signaling and the ways in which they can be used in different modes of operation. It also discusses the overall structure of such a signaling protocol. Finally, it considers the possible interactions of NSIS signaling with other protocols and functions, including security issues.</t>
