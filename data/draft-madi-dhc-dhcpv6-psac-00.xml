      <t>IPSec [RFC2401]is pervasive in many scenarios to build the channel ofsecurity mechanism to protect the communication between the host andthe local servers, such as DNS recursive name server [RFC1304]. Inthe public wireless access environment, an extra trust relationshipconfiguration between the roaming host and the local server, manuallyor by IKE [RFC2409], is indispensible.DHCP is typically the first protocol executed by a mobile host whenit enters a new network, so this document present an extension toDHCPv6 to piggyback the parameters needed for IPSec, avoiding thedelay invited by manual configuration of security association or IKEinteraction for IPSec.</t>
