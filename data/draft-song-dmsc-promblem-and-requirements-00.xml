    <abstract>
      <t>Service meshes, as one infrastructure, has been widely used in the major public cloud providers. Its main function is to accomplish the policy routing, precise traffic allocation, and traffic throttling etc. Currently, the design and implementation of service mesh takes the centralized control approach, which bring various challenges for its current deployments and further developments. This document analyzes the problems that exists in current service mesh implementations, and provide the requirements for the future distributed micro service communication(DMSC) infrastructure.</t>
