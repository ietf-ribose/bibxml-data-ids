      <t>This document proposes to identify the elementary network functions required to automatically deploy an IPv6 home network, i.e. with the minimum (and ideally not a single) intervention from any administrator or any user. The next generation Internet Protocol, IPv6, is expected to being deployed in environments such as homes and SOHOs. However, most of the people making use of the Internet at home don't have enough knowledge to set up on their own the network and services. Therefore, this document exposes the requirements necessary to ease such a deployment, from an ISP point of view.</t>
