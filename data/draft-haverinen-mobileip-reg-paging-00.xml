      <t>This document specifies Mobile IP Regional Paging (MIRP), a smalland link-layer independent extension to Mobile IP [2] with regionalregistrations [3], to support power-constrained operation in themobile nodes and to reduce routing state information in the visiteddomain. The extension allows a mobile node to enter a power savingidle mode during which its location is known with the coarseaccuracy defined by a paging area. Downlink routes to idle mobilenodes terminate in a paging foreign agent, which re-establishes themon demand by means of paging. This does not require snooping of datapackets but is a natural extension to network-level routing.Optionally, the mobile node and the visited domain can agree oncommunication time slots used for Agent Advertisements and paging,to restrict link interface power-on time in the mobile node.</t>
