      <t>This document describes PGMCC, a single rate multicast congestion control scheme which is TCP-friendly and achieves scalability, stability and fast response to variations in network conditions. PGMCC is suitable for both non-reliable and reliable data transfers. It is mainly designed for NAK- based multicast protocols, and uses a window-based, TCP-like control loop using positive ACKs between one representative of the receiver group (the ACKER) and the sender. The ACKER is selected dynamically and may change over time. PGMCC is made of two components: a window-based control loop, which closely mimics TCP behaviour, and a fast and low- overhead procedure to select (and track changes of) the ACKER. The scheme is robust to measurement errors, and supports fast response to changes in the receiver set and/or network conditions.</t>
