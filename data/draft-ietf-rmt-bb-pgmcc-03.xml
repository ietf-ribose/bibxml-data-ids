      <t>This document describes PGMCC, a single rate multicastcongestion control scheme which is TCP-friendly and achievesscalability, stability and fast response to variations innetwork conditions. PGMCC is suitable for both non-reliableand reliable data transfers. It is mainly designed for NAK-based multicast protocols, and uses a window-based, TCP-likecontrol loop using positive ACKs between one representative ofthe receiver group (the ACKER) and the sender. The ACKER isselected dynamically and may change over time.PGMCC is made of two components: a window-based control loop,which closely mimics TCP behaviour, and a fast and low-overhead procedure to select (and track changes of) the ACKER.The scheme is robust to measurement errors, and supports fastresponse to changes in the receiver set and/or networkconditions.</t>
