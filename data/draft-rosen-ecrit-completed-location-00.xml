      <t>This document defines an extension to LoST (RFC5222) that allows a request to specify that a PIDF be returned in the response if the location was valid, but there were some missing elements. For example, an civic location that did not include a postal code, but was otherwise a complete, and unambiguous location, would receive a complete PIDF in the response that included the postal code.</t>
