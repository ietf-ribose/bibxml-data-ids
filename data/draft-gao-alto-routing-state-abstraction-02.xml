      <t>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol has defined multiple services (e.g., network maps, cost maps, filtered maps, the endpoint cost service, and the endpoint property service) to provide network state information to network applications. In a higher-level view, both the cost maps and the endpoint cost service can be considered as providing views into the routing state of a network (i.e., the path properties). A drawback of these existing services, however, is that they are static, application-oblivious views, without guidance from network applications. This document designs a new ALTO service named Routing State Abstraction using Declarative Equivalence (RSADE). Allowing applications to provide declarative guidance on the intended use of the network routing state, RSADE allows a network to compute compact, customized routing state abstraction beyond the existing services.</t>
