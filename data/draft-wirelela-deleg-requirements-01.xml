    <abstract>
      <t>Authoritative control of parts of the Domain Name System namespace are indicated with a special record type, the NS record, that can only indicate the name of the server which a client resolver should contact for more information. Any other features of that server must then be discovered through other mechanisms. This draft considers the limitations of the current system, benefits that could be gained by changing it, and what requirements constrain an updated design.</t>
