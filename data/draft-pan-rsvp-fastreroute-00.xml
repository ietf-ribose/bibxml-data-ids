      <t>This document describes the use of RSVP [RSVP, RSVP-TE] to establishbackup LSP tunnels for local repair of LSP tunnels.Two methods are presented here. One is to setup one-to-one detour LSPsaccording to the requirements defined by the head-end users. The otheris to setup many-to-one bypass LSP using a single bypass tunnel tobackup a set of protected LSPs (making use of label stacking) to rerouteboth data and control traffic. Both methods can protect both link andnode during network failure, and make use of local protectiontechniques.</t>
