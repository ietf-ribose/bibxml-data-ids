    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes 'NECP', a lightweight protocol for signalling between servers and the network elements that forward traffic to them. It is intended for use in a wide variety of server applications, including for origin servers, proxies, and transparent proxies. The network element may also be a range of devices, including so-called L4 or content-aware switches and load-balancing routers. NECP provides methods for network elements to learn about servers' capabilities, availability, and hints as to which flows can and can not be serviced. This allows network elements to perform load balancing across a farm of servers, redirection to network transparent proxies, and cut-through of flows that can not be served by the farm.</t>
