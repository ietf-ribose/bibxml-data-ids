    <abstract>
      <t>Several label switching schemes have been proposed to fuse and integrate Layer 2 and Layer 3. They can be applied to various datalinks including intermittent links such as ATM SVC. Intermittent links require signaling to establish VCs before employing them and to release VCs after utilizing them. Because signaling often introduces delays and costs, some kind of optimization is necessary. This document proposes to introduce a VC pool to reduce the delays and the costs of signaling.</t>
