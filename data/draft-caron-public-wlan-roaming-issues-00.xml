      <t>Public wireless Internet access zones based on IEEE 802.11 [1] wireless LAN technology are becoming common. However, many issues are impeding further adoption of the technology by end-users, in particular the inability or difficulty to roam between the networks of different providers. This document aims to document these issues, show how they are different from roaming in other contexts such as dialup access to the Internet or GSM roaming, and how current solutions do not fully address these issues. Future documents will try to address these issues with practical solutions.</t>
