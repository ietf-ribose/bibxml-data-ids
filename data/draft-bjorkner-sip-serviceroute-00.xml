      <t>This document proposes a SIP header extension to allow for a UAC or outbound proxy to determine a request path through an initial set of downstream SIP proxies, i.e. a loose route mechanism. This is useful in scenarios of distributed service execution if for example a UA is located in a visited network and want have originating services executed in the user's home network. This solution is also applicable in the scenarios required by 3GPP in conjunction with the proposed path header.</t>
