    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes a method to multiplex a number of low bit rate audio streams (upto 256) into a single RTP/UDP/IP connection between IP telephony gateways. Audio samples from different users are assem- bled into an RTP payload thus reducing the overhead of RTP/UDP/IP headers. To identify users sharing a single RTP/UDP/IP connection, a 2 byte MINI-Header is proposed. A channel negotiation procedure to assign and release channels on a single UDP connection between gateways is described.</t>
