    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a procedure that allows receivers to compute the congestion from the received congestion information and to communicate this information back to the sender using non-TCP based protocols. The main advantage of this approach is that applications that are not using the TCP protocol as transport protocol could also apply the Conex concept to rely congestion experienced on the end-to-end path back into the network.</t>
