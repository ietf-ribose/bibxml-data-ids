      <t>This document provides an overview of the Source-Specific Multicast(SSM) service model which supports source-based multicast treesacross multiple domains in the Internet. SSM realizes components ofthe EXPRESS [HOLB99] multicast service model in which there is asingle source for every multicast channel, and channel membership isbased on the unique combination of multicast group address (G) aswell as the source's unicast address (S). End-hosts use version 3 ofthe IGMP protocol (IGMPv3) to register their interest in a particularsource-group (S,G) pair. The PIM-SM protocol is then used toconstruct the multicast forwarding tree rooted at the source S.This document is intended as a starting point for implementing anddeploying SSM services. It provides a brief architectural overview ofSSM described in more detail in [HOLBOO] and describes associateddeployment challenges. It summarizes changes to protocols andapplications both at end-hosts and routers, with pointers to moredetailed documents, wherever appropriate. Issues of interoperabilitywith the current multicast architecture are also discussed.</t>
