      <t>Over the years, a number of attack vectors that employ forged ICMP/ ICMPv6 error messages have been disclosed and exploited in the wild. The aforementioned attack vectors do not require that the source address of the packets be forged, but do require that the addresses of the IP/IPv6 packet embedded in the ICMP/ICMPv6 payload be forged. This document discusses a simple, effective, and straightforward method for using ingress traffic filtering to mitigate attacks that use forged addresses in the IP/IPv6 packet embedded in an ICMP/ICMPv6 payload.</t>
