      <t>This document specifies mechanisms of NSA (Native Short Address) that enables IP packet transmission over links where the transmission of a full length address may not be desirable. This document focuses on carrying IP packets across a LLN (Low power and Lossy Network), in which the nodes' location is fixed and changes in the logical topology are caused only by unstable radio connectivity (not physical mobility). The specifications include NSA allocation, routing mechanisms, header format design including length-variable fields, and IPv6 interconnection support.</t>
