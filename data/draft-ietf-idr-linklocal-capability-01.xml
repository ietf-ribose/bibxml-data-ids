    <abstract>
      <t>BGP [RFC4271], was originally designed to provide reachability between domains and between the edges of a domain. To support IPv6 reachability, BGP relies heavily on its Multiprotocol Extensions as defined in [RFC2545], which is crucial for enabling BGP-4 to advertise IPv6 routes alongside IPv4. This extension not only permits the exchange of IPv6 routing information but also establishes the structure for IPv6 next hop handling within BGP updates. As such, BGP assumes the next hop towards any reachable destination may not reside on the advertising speaker, but rather may either be through a router connected to the same subnet as the speaker, or through a router only reachable by traversing multiple hops through the network. [RFC2545] introduced the ability to advertise a global IPv6 address as the BGP next hop. When the advertising system is directly attached, it may include both a global and an IPv6 link-local address or only a global address, when next hop length is set to 16 bytes. This document updates the specification to clarify the encoding of the BGP next hop when the advertising system is directly attached and only an IPv6 link-local address is available. This clarification applies specifically to IPv6 link-local addresses and does not pertain to IPv4 link-local addresses as defined in [RFC3927].</t>
