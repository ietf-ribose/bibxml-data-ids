      <t>This document defines OODA-HTTP, a protocol extension and adaptive security framework that applies the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act loop to HTTP/HTTPS communications. OODA-HTTP introduces dynamic behavior at the application layer, enabling real-time detection, decision, and mitigation based on evolving threat contexts. Each HTTP request becomes not just a message, but an observation signal, a decision vector, and a defensive act. This framework introduces headers such as X-OODA-Action to carry contextual scores or actions across clients, servers, and intermediaries. OODA-HTTP transforms passive transport into active self-defense, offering resilience against classic and quantum threats. It is designed as a native defender of the World Wide Web \[Gupta23]\[Martinez22]\[Wang21]\[Kim23].</t>
