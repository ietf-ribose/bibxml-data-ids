      <t>This document provides a historical as well as practical overview of the implementation of Number Portability (NP) Administration in the United States (U.S.). There are various regulatory constraints that establish relevant parameters for NP implementation, most of which are not network technology specific. This document describes the NP business model and the architecture for NP administration in the North America. It also briefly discusses the functions performed by the NP administrator and the cost recovery mechanism.</t>
