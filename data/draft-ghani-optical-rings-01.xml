      <t>Given the large installed base of ring fiber-plants and the extensive experience operators have gained in operating SONET (SDH) ring networks, optical rings are becoming increasingly important. As such, optical rings will play a crucial role in the migration from existing TDM-based SONET (SDH) architectures to more dynamic lightpath provisioning paradigms. To date, various optical ring concepts have been tabled, proposing multi-services support and mirroring the fast protection switching capabilities of existing SONET (SDH) rings. Nevertheless, the emerging IP-based MPL(ambda)S framework for optical networks is largely based upon (optical) mesh routing concepts.</t>
