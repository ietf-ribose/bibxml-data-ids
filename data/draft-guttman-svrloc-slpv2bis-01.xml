      <t>SLPv2 [1] has been widely implemented but not all features of the protocol are in common use. If these features were deprecated from the specification the protocol would be simpler, yet still perform its core function. The changes proposed in this document could be the basis for a revision of SLPv2 as it is considered for advancement to Draft Standard.</t>
