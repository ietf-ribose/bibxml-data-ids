      <t>This document describes Lemonade requirements for server to client notifications. These server to client notifications provide information on crucial changes to a client. This document does not assume how notifications are provided to the clients: the client to server notifications may be actively pushed to a client through different mechanisms rather than requiring the client to initiate contact to ask for state changes; or they may be polled by the client, still avoiding that the client performs full state comparisons.</t>
