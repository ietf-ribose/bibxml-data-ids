    <abstract>
      <t>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) provides a digital signature mechanism for Internet messages, allowing a domain name owner to affix its domain name in a way that can be cryptographically validated. DKIM signatures protect the integrity of the message header and body only. By design, it decoupled itself from the transport and storage mechanisms used to handle messages. This gives rise to a possible replay attack, which the original DKIM specification acknowledged but did not provide a mitigation strategy. This document presents an optional method for binding a signature to a specific recipient or set of recipients so that broader replay attacks can be mitigated.</t>
