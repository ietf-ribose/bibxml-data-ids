      <t>A tag switching architecture is described in [1]. Tag Switching enables the use of ATM Switches as Tag Switching Routers. The ATM Switches run network layer routing algorithms (such as OSPF, IS-IS, etc.), and their data forwarding is based on the results of these routing algorithms. No ATM-specific routing or addressing is needed. This document describes how the tag switching architecture is applied to ATM switches.</t>
