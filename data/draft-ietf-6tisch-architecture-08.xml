      <t>This document is the first volume of the 6TiSCH architecture of an IPv6 Multi-Link subnet that is composed of a high speed powered backbone and a number of IEEE802.15.4 TSCH low-power wireless networks attached and synchronized by Backbone Routers. The architecture defines mechanisms to establish and maintain routing and scheduling in a centralized, distributed, or mixed fashion.</t>
