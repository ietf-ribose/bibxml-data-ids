      <t>Legislators writing laws that would limit or prohibit the sending ofunsolicited bulk email (UBE) or unsolicited commercial email (UCE) havebegun to include rules that require mail servers to include particularwording in the SMTP banner. To date, this wording has had two distinctpurposes: to warn senders that they may not send UBE or UCE to that SMTPhost, and to state the physical location of the host so that the sender mayknow which laws apply. This document is meant to help clarify how such legislation might beworded, and to help increase interoperability of various laws. It is notmeant to be a standard of any kind, but is meant only for its informationalvalue.</t>
