    <abstract>
      <t>This is an update of an individual contribution that has been accepted as a work item by the Benchmarking Methodology Working Group, and will split into two BMWG documents. It is being posted for information. T This document defines a specific set of tests that router implementers can use to measure and report the convergence performance of BGP-4 processes. It doe not consider the forwarding performance of such routers once they have converged, or the convergence characteristics of the global routing system.</t>
