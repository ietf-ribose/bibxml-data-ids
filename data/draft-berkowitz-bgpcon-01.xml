      <t>This is an update of an individual contribution that has beenaccepted as a work item by the Benchmarking Methodology WorkingGroup, and will split into two BMWG documents. It is being postedfor information. T This document defines a specific set of tests thatrouter implementers can use to measure and report the convergenceperformance of BGP-4 processes. It doe not consider the forwardingperformance of such routers once they have converged, or the convergencecharacteristics of the global routing system.</t>
