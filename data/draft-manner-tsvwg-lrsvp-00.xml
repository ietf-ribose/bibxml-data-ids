      <t>Guaranteed QoS for multimedia applications is based on reservedresources in each node on the end-to-end path. Even if thecorrespondent node does not support QoS, it would be useful to beable to reserve at least local resources at the access network, e.g.,wireless link resources. Additionally, for mobile nodes thecontinuity of QoS is disturbed due to end-to-end signaling or slowre-reservations of resources after each handover. This draft proposesa simple enhancement to RSVP, so that initial resource reservationsand re-reservations, e.g., due to host mobility can be done locallyin an access network.</t>
