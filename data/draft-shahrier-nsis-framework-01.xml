      <t>This Internet Draft describes the end-to-end signaling architecture and framework model for transmitting packets through a series of heterogeneous networks. The Next-Steps-In-Signaling (NSIS) Working Group is already working on defining a set of requirements for the QoS signaling protocol [1]. This document is the follow on to the requirements draft, and the precursor to any solutions document. It outlines a framework for transporting end-to-end QoS parameters, initiated and maintained by the 'Originator' of the service. This draft elaborates on the requirements draft. It defines more precisely the scope of NSIS for end-to-end packet flows, in terms of QoS Signaling, where the resource reservations for the service are initiated by the “Originator” end point and whether this service is bi- directional or unidirectional (i.e., receive-only or send-only). The draft is fully backward compatible; it requires no changes to the existing QoS signaling protocols or procedures. It applysapplies generic messages to transport the information needed to establish the desired QoS for traffic flows in either one or both directions. This document can be used as the guideline for a prospective solution to the QoS signaling problem.</t>
