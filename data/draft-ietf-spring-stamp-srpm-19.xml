    <abstract>
      <t>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm and applies to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. This document describes the procedures for Performance Measurement in SR networks using the Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP), as defined in RFC 8762, along with its optional extensions defined in RFC 8972 and further augmented in RFC 9503. The described procedure is used for links and SR paths (including SR Policies, SR IGP best paths, and SR IGP Flexible Algorithm paths), as well as Layer-3 and Layer-2 services in SR networks, and is applicable to both SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes.</t>
