    <abstract>
      <t>Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a new paradigm where network communications are accomplished by requesting named content, instead of sending packets to destination addresses. Named Data Networking (NDN) and Content-Centric Networking (CCN) are two prominent ICN architectures. This document provides an overview of the terminology and definitions that have been used in describing concepts in these two projects. While there are other ICN architectures, they are not part of the NDN and CCN vision and as such are out of scope for this document.</t>
