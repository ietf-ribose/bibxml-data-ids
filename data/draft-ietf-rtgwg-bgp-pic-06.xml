      <t>In the network comprising thousands of iBGP peers exchanging millionsof routes, many routes are reachable via more than one next-hop.Given the large scaling targets, it is desirable to restore trafficafter failure in a time period that does not depend on the number ofBGP prefixes. In this document we proposed an architecture by whichtraffic can be re-routed to ECMP or pre-calculated backup paths in atimeframe that does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. Theobjective is achieved through organizing the forwarding datastructures in a hierarchical manner and sharing forwarding elementsamong the maximum possible number of routes. The proposed techniqueachieves prefix independent convergence while ensuring incrementaldeployment, complete automation, and zero management and provisioningeffort. It is noteworthy to mention that the benefits of BGP-PIC arehinged on the existence of more than one path whether as ECMP orprimary-backup.</t>
