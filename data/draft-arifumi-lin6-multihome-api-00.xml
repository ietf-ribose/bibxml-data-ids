      <t>This document describes a method for multihoming support in application layer. We extend the basic socket API(Application Programming Interface) and propose some new interfaces for multihoming. Multihoming nodes are expected to have multiple addresses. The existing socket APIs, however, are not designed to manipulate multiple addresses in a connection. Proposed APIs help an application to handle multiple addresses, to avoid connection failure and to do load-balancing possibly. Right now, the proposed APIs are for LIN6 nodes, one of the mobile protocols. This is because LIN6's addressing architecture, which is called '8+8', is very friendly and consistent with multihoming. In this document, we propose a host- based multihoming solution and which is called end-to-end multihoming. In end-to-end multihoming, a fault-tolerant connection can be achieved relying not on routers but on the pair of end-nodes only.</t>
