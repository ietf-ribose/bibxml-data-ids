      <t>Flow selection is the process in charge of electing a limited numberof flows from all of those observed at an observation point to beconsidered into the measurement process chain. The flow selectionprocess can be enabled at different stages of the monitoringreference model. It can be performed at metering time once thepacket classification has been executed, i.e. flow state dependentpacket selection, or at recording/exporting time by limiting thenumber of flows to be stored and/or exported to the collectorapplications. This document illustrates the motivations which mightlead flow selection to be performed and presents a classification ofthe related techniques. The document furthermore provides aninformation model for configuring flow selection techniques anddiscusses what information about the flow selection process isbeneficial to be exported by adopting a suitable information model.</t>
