      <t>Flow selection is the process in charge of electing a limited number of flows from all of those observed at an observation point to be considered into the measurement process chain. The flow selection process can be enabled at different stages of the monitoring reference model. It can be performed at metering time once the packet classification has been executed, i.e. flow state dependent packet selection, or at recording/exporting time by limiting the number of flows to be stored and/or exported to the collector applications. This document illustrates the motivations which might lead flow selection to be performed and presents a classification of the related techniques. The document furthermore provides an information model for configuring flow selection techniques and discusses what information about the flow selection process is beneficial to be exported by adopting a suitable information model.</t>
