      <t>This draft provides an applicability statement for the transparent AAL5 PDU frame mode encapsulation in draft-fischer [4]. Draft-fischer describes methods to carry ATM services over IP, L2TP or MPLS. The PSN (e.g. MPLS) is used to transport ATM layer services such as those defined by ITU-T as ATM transfer capabilities [2] and the ATM Forum as ATM service categories [3]. The basic requirement is to transparently transport ATM VCC service related information (e.g., traffic parameters, QoS, OAM, etc.) over the Pseudo Wire (PW), over the packet network. Transparent PDU frame mode enables bandwidth efficiency gains to be realized for ATM VCCs that use AAL5, yet still provide full ATM transparency, including the correct sequencing of OAM cells on an AAL5 flow.</t>
