    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) framework, a hybrid routing framework suitable for a wide variety of mobile ad-hocnetworks, especially those with large network spans and diversemobility patterns. Each node proactively maintains routes within alocal region (referred to as the routing zone). Knowledge of therouting zone topology is leveraged by the ZRP to improve theefficiency of a globally reactive route query/reply mechanism. The proactive maintenance of routing zones also helps improve the qualityof discovered routes, by making them more robust to changes in networktopology. The ZRP can be configured for a particular network by properselection of a single parameter, the routing zone radius.</t>
