      <t>This document describes the Zone Routing Protocol (ZRP) framework, a hybrid routing framework suitable for a wide variety of mobile ad-hoc networks, especially those with large network spans and diverse mobility patterns. Each node proactively maintains routes within a local region (referred to as the routing zone). Knowledge of the routing zone topology is leveraged by the ZRP to improve the efficiency of a globally reactive route query/reply mechanism. The proactive maintenance of routing zones also helps improve the quality of discovered routes, by making them more robust to changes in network topology. The ZRP can be configured for a particular network by proper selection of a single parameter, the routing zone radius.</t>
