      <t>This document describes extensions to IS-IS, OSPF, and BGP-LS Traffic Engineering to distribute the Bit Error Rate (BER) and Packet Error Rate (PER) metrics for the links that can be used for flexible algorithm and path selection purpose. Note that this document only covers the mechanisms with which network-performance information is distributed. The mechanisms for measuring network performance or acting on that information, once distributed, are outside the scope of this document.</t>
