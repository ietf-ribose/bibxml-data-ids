      <t>In order to support more flexible replication methods, it isdesirable to specify some manner in which an LDAP client mayretrieve a set of changes that have been applied to an LDAP server'sdatabase. The client, which may be another LDAP server, may thenchoose to update its own replicated copy of the data. This documentspecifies an object class that may be used to represent changesapplied to an LDAP server. It also specifies a method fordiscovering the location of the container object that holds thesechange records, so that clients and servers have a common rendezvouspoint for this information.</t>
