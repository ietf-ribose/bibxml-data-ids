    <abstract>
      <t>In order to support more flexible replication methods, it is desirable to specify some manner in which an LDAP client may retrieve a set of changes that have been applied to an LDAP server's database. The client, which may be another LDAP server, may then choose to update its own replicated copy of the data. This document specifies an object class that may be used to represent changes applied to an LDAP server. It also specifies a method for discovering the location of the container object that holds these change records, so that clients and servers have a common rendezvous point for this information.</t>
