      <t>The document "FIB Suppression with Virtual Aggregation"[I-D.francis-intra-va] describes how router FIB size may be reduced.This approach entails a trade-off between path-length and load versusFIB size. It also has the potential to reduce convergence time.This document describes the results of several studies that examinethese characteristics. The results of a study for a Tier-1 ISP witha relatively sophisticated deployment of VA, shows that FIB sizecould be reduced ten times or more with a worst-case latency penaltyof 4ms and a worst-case load increase of &lt;1.5%. Another study,examining a much simpler style of VA deployment, also for a Tier-1ISP, shows that FIB size can be reduced by four times (in routersserving as APRs), and more than 10 times in other routers. Here,worst-case latency increase was 16 ms, though this is almostcertainly an over-estimate, both because traceroute was used to makethe measurement, and because popular prefixes were not considered.</t>
