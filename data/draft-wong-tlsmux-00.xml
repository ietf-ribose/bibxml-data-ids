      <t>This document describes a multiplexing protocol that allows remote machines to access local services in a secure manner. All clients must connect to the multiplexer using TLS, allowing encrypted network communications to normally cleartext protocols. TLSMUX is an application level protocol that does not require a kernel upgrade or extensions to existing protocols in order to operate. By offering a TLS connection to a multiplexer, current servers and protocols do not need to be modified to benefit from the encryption features of TLSMUX. Some clients may need to be updated to support TLSMUX, although it is possible for some clients to use a TLSMUX proxy without modification.</t>
