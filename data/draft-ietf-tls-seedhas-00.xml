      <t>This document proposes the addition of new cipher suites to the TLS protocol 1.0 [TLS] to support SEED and HAS-160. The SEED algorithm is 128-bit symmetric block cipher algorithm. [SEED] The HAS-160 is 160-bit secure hash function, whose block size is 512 bit. [HAS] Both algorithms are developed in Korea since 1997 for stronger communication security. Currently, SEED is widely used and is the mandatory cipher in banking and stock applications in Korea.</t>
