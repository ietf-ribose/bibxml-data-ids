      <t>The Routing Over Low-Power and Lossy (ROLL) networks Working Group has been chartered to work on routing solutions for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) in various markets: industrial, commercial (building), home, and urban networks. Pursuant to this effort, this document defines the IPv6 routing requirements for building automation. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>
