    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines two extensions to the capabilities of a Bundle Protocol Agent (BPA) (as defined in [refs.DTNBP]) that is processing bundles within the context of a Delay-Tolerant Network architecture [refs.DTNarch]. It defines an operation called "diversion", which is the act of a bundle protocol agent moving an entire bundle from some point in bundle processing in the BPA to a DTN application agent. This diversion of a bundle from the BPA to an application agent is distinct from delivery of the bundle at that application agent. This document defines a second operation, called "injection", which is the inverse of diversion. Injection is the act of an application agent moving an entire bundle from the application agent into some point in bundle processing in the BPA. This injection of a bundle from an application agent to the BPA is distinct from bundle transmission.</t>
