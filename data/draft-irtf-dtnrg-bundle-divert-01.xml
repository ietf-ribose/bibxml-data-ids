      <t>This document defines two extensions to the capabilities of a BundleProtocol Agent (BPA) (as defined in [refs.DTNBP]) that is processingbundles within the context of a Delay-Tolerant Network architecture[refs.DTNarch]. It defines an operation called "diversion", which isthe act of a bundle protocol agent moving an entire bundle from somepoint in bundle processing in the BPA to a DTN application agent.This diversion of a bundle from the BPA to an application agent isdistinct from delivery of the bundle at that application agent. Thisdocument defines a second operation, called "injection", which is theinverse of diversion. Injection is the act of an application agentmoving an entire bundle from the application agent into some point inbundle processing in the BPA. This injection of a bundle from anapplication agent to the BPA is distinct from bundle transmission.</t>
