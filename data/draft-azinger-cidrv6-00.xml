      <t>This document discusses strategies for assigning and aggregating IPv6address space. While CIDR was created to help alleviate this problemin regards to IPv4 addresses with the original [RFC1519] (and updatedin [RFC4632]) we are now in need of a similar document to givedirection for IPv6 addressing policies. Similarly, [RFC1518]discussed how to use CIDR to allocate address space for IPv4, and[RFC1887] discusses the subject for IPv6. The objective here is toupdate these documents and provide the best current guidance on howto manage address space in conjunction with managing the growth ofrouting tables in an IPv6 world.</t>
