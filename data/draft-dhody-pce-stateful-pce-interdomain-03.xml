      <t>A stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information about Label Switched Path (LSP) characteristics and resource usage within a network in order to provide traffic engineering path calculations for its associated Path Computation Clients (PCCs). Furthermore, PCEs are used to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains. This document describes general considerations for the deployment of stateful PCE(s) in inter-domain scenarios including inter-area and inter-AS. The inter-layer considerations will be described in a separate document.</t>
