      <t>This document describes a set of enhancements to the Network News Transport Protocol [NNTP-977] that provide a generic mechanism by which clients and servers can exchange configuration information. It was originally designed as a method by which an NNTP client could request URLs from the server in order to access out-of-band information. It is not however limited to URLs and may be used to communicate such things as language settings, client prefences, formatting information, etc. The protocol additions are designed in a manner which allows the client and server to exchange key/data pairs of arbitrary text strings.</t>
