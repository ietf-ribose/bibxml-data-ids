      <t>Base Proxy Mobile IPv6 requires all communications to go through thelocal mobility anchor. As this can be suboptimal, local routing hasbeen defined to allow mobile nodes attached to the same or differentmobile access gateways to exchange traffic by using local forwardingor a direct tunnel between the gateways. This document proposes aninitiation method and fast handover mechanisms for local routing.The solutions aim at reducing handover delay and packet loss.</t>
