    <abstract>
      <t>This document discusses the use of One Way Latency (OWL) for enhancing multipath transmission in QUIC. Several representative usages of OWL, such as congestion control mechanism, retransmission policy, crucial data scheduling are analyzed. Two kinds of OWL measurement approaches are also provided and compared. More explorations related with OWL will be researched to improve the performance of QUIC.</t>
