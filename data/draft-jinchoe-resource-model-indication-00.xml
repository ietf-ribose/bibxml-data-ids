      <t>There is much interest in "Internet of Things (IoT)" and multiple standards following the REST architectural style are under development. In a RESTful interaction, IoT devices need to understand each other's resource representations, both the semantic meaning and the syntactic form, to interact properly. For interoperability among different standards, it is helpful for CoAP endpoints to indicate the resource models they support. This document presents a scheme for IoT devices to exchange their resource model information and requests from IANA new Internet media types and CoAP Content-Format identifier for resource model indication.</t>
