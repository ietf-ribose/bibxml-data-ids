    <abstract>
      <t>Route Origin Validation (ROV) using the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) enables BGP routers to identify illegitimate routes that violate Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs). However, widespread deployment of RPKI requires validation systems to process high volumes of route announcements against increasingly large ROA datasets, where ROV adoption faces significant barriers due to concerns about its processing efficiency. This document identifies a performance issue inherent in current ROV procedure, which could be exacerbated as the expanding coverage of ROAs.</t>
