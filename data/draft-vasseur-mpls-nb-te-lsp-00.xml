      <t>Several Link-type sub-TLVs have been defined for OSPF and ISIS in thecontext of MPLS Traffic Engineering in order to convery some linkcharacteristics such as the available bandwidth, traffic engineringmetric, adminstrative group and so on. There are variouscircumstances where it would be useful to also know the number ofunconstrained Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path(s) (TE LSP).This document specifies a new Link-type Traffic Engineering sub-TLVused to advertise the number of unconstrained TE LSP(s) signalledacross a specific link.</t>
