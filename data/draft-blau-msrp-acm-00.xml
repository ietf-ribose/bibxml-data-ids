      <t>This document defines an alternative connection model for MSRP UAs.The model differs from the standard MSRP model, as defined in RFC4975and RFC4976, in that it uses SDP in a more conventional way when itcomes to conveying endpoint address information, and also usesmainstream mechanisms for NAT traversal instead of using MSRP relays.</t>
