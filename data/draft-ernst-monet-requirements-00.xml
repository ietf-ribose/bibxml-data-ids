      <t>The purpose of traditional mobility support is to provide continuousInternet connectivity to mobile hosts (host mobility support). Incontrast, network mobility support is concerned with situations wherean entire network changes its point of attachment to the Internet andthus its reachability in the topology. We shall refer to such anetwork as a mobile network (MONET). This document tries to identifywhat constraints limit the implementation and the deployment of apotentially and ideally good solution, and what requirementssolutions must comply to. Our main aim is to raise the discussion onthe mailing list.</t>
