      <t>The purpose of traditional mobility support is to provide continuous Internet connectivity to mobile hosts (host mobility support). In contrast, network mobility support is concerned with situations where an entire network changes its point of attachment to the Internet and thus its reachability in the topology. We shall refer to such a network as a mobile network (MONET). This document tries to identify what constraints limit the implementation and the deployment of a potentially and ideally good solution, and what requirements solutions must comply to. Our main aim is to raise the discussion on the mailing list.</t>
