    <abstract>
      <t>Deploying large-scale AI services in data centers poses new challenges to traditional technologies such as load balancing and congestion control. Besides, emerging network technologies such as in-network computing are gradually accepted and used in AI data centers. These network-assisted application acceleration technologies require that cross-layer interaction information can be flexibly transmitted between end-hosts and network nodes. APDN (Application-aware Date Center Network) adopts the APN framework for application side to provide more application-aware information for the data center network, enabling the fast evolution of network- application co-design technology. This document elaborates use cases of APDNs and proposes the requirements.</t>
