      <t>This specification augments "Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4" (MP- BGP) by proposing a mechanism to facilitate the use of multiple sessions between a given pair of BGP speakers. Each session is used to transport routes related by some session-based attribute such as AFI/SAFI. This provides an alternative to the MP-BGP approach of multiplexing all routes onto a single connection. Use of this approach is expected to provide finer-grained fault management and isolation as the BGP protocol is used to support more and more diverse services.</t>
