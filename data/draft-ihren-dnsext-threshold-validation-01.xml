      <t>This memo documents a proposal for a different method of validationfor DNSSEC aware resolvers. The key change is that by changing froma model of one Key Signing Key, KSK, at a time to multiple KSKs itwill be possible to increase the aggregated trust in the signedkeys by leveraging from the trust associated with the differentsignees. By having multiple keys to chose from validating resolvers get theopportunity to use local policy to reflect actual trust indifferent keys. For instance, it is possible to trust a single,particular key ultimately, while requiring multiple validsignatures by less trusted keys for validation to succeed.Furthermore, with multiple KSKs there are additional redundancybenefits available since it is possible to roll over different KSKsat different times which may make rollover scenarios easier tomanage.</t>
