    <abstract>
      <t>A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual network which has a customized network topology and a set of dedicated or shared network resources allocated from the physical network. A VTN can be used as the underlay for one or a group of overlay VPNs to provide enhanced VPN (VPN+) services. In packet forwarding, some fields in the data packet needs to be used to identify the VTN the packet belongs to, so that the VTN-specific processing can be performed on each node the packet traverses. This document proposes a new Hop-by-Hop option of IPv6 extension header to carry the VTN ID, which can be used to identify the Virtual Transport Network (VTN) the packet belongs to. The procedure for processing the VTN option is also specified.</t>
