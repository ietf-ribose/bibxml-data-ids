      <t>Since IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are represented by different resource records in the Domain Name System, operating systems capable of running both IPv4 and IPv6 need to execute two queries when resolving a host name. This document discusses the conditions under which a stub resolver can optimize the process by not sending one of the queries if the host is connected to a single-stack network.</t>
