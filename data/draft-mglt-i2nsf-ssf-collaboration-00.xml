      <t>This document specifies a collaboration agreement protocol. The collaboration agreement makes possible individual security services functions (SSF) to collaborate with each other. The collaboration is mostly intended for SSF located in different administrative domains, in which case the collaboration cannot be performed by a shared orchestrator. The collaboration between SSF in different domains assumes the traffic is steered through the two domains.</t>
