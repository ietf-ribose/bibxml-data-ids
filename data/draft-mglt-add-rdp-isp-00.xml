      <t>The DNS Resolving service Discovery Protocol (DRDP) enables to discover resolving services available and eventually upgrade to an encrypted resolving service. DRDP requires a resolving domain or a pointer to a list of resolving domains. Currently ISP or CPEs do not advertise resolving domain or pointers to resolving domains which does not make possible for a DNS client to discover potential resolving services - such as encrypted DNS for example - made available by the ISP. Instead, ISPs or CPE advertise via DHCP the IP address of the host with a IA Address Option [RFC3315] and the IP addresses of the resolver provided by the ISP with Recursive Name Server option [RFC3646]. This document describes a procedure for a DNS client to derive resolving domains from the legacy configuration of the host. This is expected to ease the deployment of encrypted DNS from ISP as it will enable OS, applications to discover resolving service put in place by the ISP even though the CPE has not been upgraded.</t>
