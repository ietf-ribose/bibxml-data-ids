      <t>This draft was submitted to obtain comments for an experimental workin progress. It presents Fast Mobile IPv6 and Context Transferinteractions for a specific case of contextful, anticipative,network controlled and Layer-2 source-triggered IPv6 handover whereone or more candidate access routers can be identified for selectionas target. It is also meant to illustrate a case where it might beuseful to:a) have Context Transfer messages as but options in handovernegotiation messages (e.g., Fast MIPv6's HI/HACK messages)between Access Routers.b) have an additional flag in the Context Transfer Protocol ContextTransfer Data message which indicates whether the new AccessRouter should install any context at all given that any onecontext fails to be installed.</t>
