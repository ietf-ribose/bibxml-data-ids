      <t>This draft was submitted to obtain comments for an experimental work in progress. It presents Fast Mobile IPv6 and Context Transfer interactions for a specific case of contextful, anticipative, network controlled and Layer-2 source-triggered IPv6 handover where one or more candidate access routers can be identified for selection as target. It is also meant to illustrate a case where it might be useful to: a) have Context Transfer messages as but options in handover negotiation messages (e.g., Fast MIPv6's HI/HACK messages) between Access Routers. b) have an additional flag in the Context Transfer Protocol Context Transfer Data message which indicates whether the new Access Router should install any context at all given that any one context fails to be installed.</t>
