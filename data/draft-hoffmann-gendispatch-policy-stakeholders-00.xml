    <abstract>
      <t>At IETF115 a side meeting on policymaker engagement with the IETF was held. This meeting identified the significance of the IETFâ€™s work for wider societal, economic, and political communities, as well as existing gaps and barriers to engagement for policy experts. This informational draft provides an overview of the side meeting and introduces the problem statement and gap analysis of existing initiatives in this space. It also poses questions we hope to work through with others in the IETF community regarding how to better enable policy expert engagement in IETF standardisation, and on how we can build a culture which better supports technical and policy experts working together to develop more robust standards.</t>
