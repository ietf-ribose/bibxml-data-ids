      <t>This document discusses a range of implementation and specification issues concerning features related to the use of location-related attributes in NFSv4. These include migration, which transfers responsibility for a file system from one server to another, and trunking which deals with the discovery and control of the set of network addresses to use to access a file system. The focus of the discussion, which relates to multiple minor versions, is on providing appropriate clarification and correction of existing specifications.</t>
