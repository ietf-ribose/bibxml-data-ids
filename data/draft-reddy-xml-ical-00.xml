      <t>The motivation for this proposal is the expanded scope and diversity of the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web provides a simple and effective means for users to search, browse, retrieve, and publish information of their own available for others. Now that Web browsers and servers are ubiquitous on the Internet, it is worthwhile to use XML to encode calendar objects. The power and extensibility of XML allows us to represent calendar data objects as well-formed XML documents. ICAL is an existing standard format for representing calendar components. This draft explains how to represent calendar components in XML that are compatible and easily translatable to the iCAL format. Copyright (C) The Internet Society 1998. All Rights Reserved.</t>
