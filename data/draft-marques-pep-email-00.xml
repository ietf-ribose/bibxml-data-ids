      <t>The pretty Easy privacy (pEp) propositions for email are based upon already existing email and encryption formats (i.e., PGP/MIME) and designed to allow for easy implementable and interoperable opportunistic encryption: this ranging from key distribution to mechanisms of subject encryption. The goal of pEp for email is to automatize operations in order to make email encryption usuable by a wider range of Internet users, such that practices for confidentiality and privacy can be achieved in reality. In this document, basic operations of pEp's approach towards email and two PGP/MIME formats (pEp Email Format 1 and 2) providing certain security guarantees are described. The proposed operations and and formats are targeted to Opportunistic Security scenarios and are already implemented in several applications of pretty Easy privacy (pEp).</t>
