      <t>When deploying IPv6, whether IPv6-only or dual-stack, routers areconfigured to send IPv6 Router Advertisements to convey informationto nodes that enable them to autoconfigure on the network. Thisinformation includes the implied default router address taken fromthe observed source address of the Router Advertisement (RA) message,as well as on-link prefix information. However, unintendedmisconfigurations by users or administrators, or possibly maliciousattacks on the network, may lead to bogus RAs being present, which inturn can cause operational problems for hosts on the network. Inthis draft we summarise the scenarios in which rogue RAs may beobserved and present a list of possible solutions to the problem. Wefocus on the unintended causes of rogue RAs in the text. The goal ofthis text is to be Informational, and as such to present a frameworkaround which solutions can be proposed and discussed.</t>
