    <abstract>
      <t>This specification provides a way for an ephemeral or transactional OAuth 2.0 client to signal to the AS that the client does not need or expect to have an identified state outside the existence of any issued access and refresh tokens. The specification also enables a client to push its registration information to the AS during a pushed authorization request.</t>
