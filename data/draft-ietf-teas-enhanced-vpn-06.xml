    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the framework for Enhanced Virtual Private Network (VPN+) service. The purpose is to support the needs of new applications, particularly applications that are associated with 5G services, by utilizing an approach that is based on existing VPN and Traffic Engineering (TE) technologies and adds features that specific services require over and above traditional VPNs. Typically, VPN+ will be used to form the underpinning of network slicing, but could also be of use in its own right providing enhanced connectivity services between customer sites. It is envisaged that enhanced VPNs will be delivered using a combination of existing, modified, and new networking technologies. This document provides an overview of relevant technologies and identifies some areas for potential new work. Comparing to traditional VPNs, It is not envisaged that quite large numbers of VPN+ services will be deployed in a network. In other word, it is not intended that all existing VPNs supported by a network will use VPN+ related techniques.</t>
