      <t>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) was not written with the expectation that additional stateful DHCPv6 options would be developed. IPv6 Prefix Options for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) version 6 shoe-horned the new options for Prefix Delegation into DHCPv6. Implementation experience of the CPE model described in RFC6204 has shown multiple issues with the DHCPv6 protocol in supporting multiple stateful options. This document updates RFC3315 and indirectly RFC3633.</t>
