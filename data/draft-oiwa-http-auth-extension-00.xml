      <t>This document specifies an extension of HTTP authentication framework for use with interactive clients. Recently, the fundamental features of HTTP-level authentication is not enough for complex requirements of various Web-based applications. This makes these applications to implement their own authentication frameworks using HTML Forms and other means, which becomes one of the hurdles against introducing secure authentication mechanisms handled jointly by servers and user- agent clients. The extended framework fills gaps between Web application requirements and HTTP authentication provisions to solve the above problems, while maintaining some upper-compatibility against existing Web and non-Web uses of HTTP authentications.</t>
