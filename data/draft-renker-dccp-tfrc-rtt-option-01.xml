      <t>This document describes an update to CCID-3/4 that addressesparameter-estimation problems occurring with TFRC-based DCCPcongestion control.The fix uses a recommendation made in the original TFRCspecification. It avoids the inherent problems of receiver-based RTTsampling, by utilising higher-accuracy RTT samples already availableat the sender. It is integrated into the feature set of DCCP as anend-to-end negotiable extension, upward and downward compatible.</t>
