      <t>This document describes an update to CCID-3/4 that addresses parameter-estimation problems occurring with TFRC-based DCCP congestion control. The fix uses a recommendation made in the original TFRC specification. It avoids the inherent problems of receiver-based RTT sampling, by utilising higher-accuracy RTT samples already available at the sender. It is integrated into the feature set of DCCP as an end-to-end negotiable extension, upward and downward compatible.</t>
