      <t>The target of DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) is toprovide an open and standard in-network storage system forapplications, primarily P2P applications, to store, retrieve andmanage their data. This draft enumerates and explains requirements,not only for store and retrieve, but also for data management, accesscontrol and resource control, that should be considered during thedesign and implementation of a DECADE system. These are requirementson the entire system, some of the requirements may eventually beimplemented by an existing protocol with/without some extensions(e.g. the data transport level), but a user of DECADE as a completearchitecture would be guaranteed such functionality.</t>
