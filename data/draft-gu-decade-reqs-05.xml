      <t>The target of DECoupled Application Data Enroute (DECADE) is to provide an open and standard in-network storage system for applications, primarily P2P applications, to store, retrieve and manage their data. This draft enumerates and explains requirements, not only for store and retrieve, but also for data management, access control and resource control, that should be considered during the design and implementation of a DECADE system. These are requirements on the entire system, some of the requirements may eventually be implemented by an existing protocol with/without some extensions (e.g. the data transport level), but a user of DECADE as a complete architecture would be guaranteed such functionality.</t>
