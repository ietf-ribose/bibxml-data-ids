      <t>Recent interest in finding solutions for traffic problems stemming from HTTP have centered around the use of cooperating proxy-caches. We contend that by using a deterministic, hash-based approach for routing URLs within an 'array' of proxy servers, many of the benefits of alternative cache cooperation protocols (such as ICP) may be realized. As an example of such an implementation we propose the use of 'Proxy Client Configuration Files' between proxy servers in order to exchange routing information. This implementation is motivated in part by the adoption of this file by existing, popular web browsers to provide intelligent URL request routing. This draft discusses adopting this well-understood, widely implemented browser protocol by web proxies in order to facilitate intelligent routing of requests within a network of proxy servers.</t>
