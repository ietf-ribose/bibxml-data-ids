    <abstract>
      <t>The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) defines a process for validating received data and assert them authentic and complete as opposed to forged. While DNSSEC comes with some complexity, at least for non expert, that complexity is mostly abstracted by the resolver. As result, running a resolver with DNSSEC enabled only requires the operator to only follow a very limited set of recommendations. This document provides such recommendations.</t>
