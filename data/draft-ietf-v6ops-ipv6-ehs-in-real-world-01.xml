    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents real-world data regarding the extent to which packets with IPv6 extension headers are dropped in the Internet (as measured in August 2014), and where in the network such dropping occurs. The aforementioned results serve as a problem statement that is expected to trigger operational advice on the filtering of IPv6 packets carrying IPv6 Extension Headers, so that the situation improves over time. This document also explains how the aforementioned results were obtained, such that the corresponding measurements can be reproduced by other members of the community.</t>
