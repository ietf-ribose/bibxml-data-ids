      <t>With LCAS and VCAT, the transport layer is capable of not onlyproviding right-sized data pipes, but also elastic pipes. Fluidtransport pipes spur services like frame-relay transport (CIR, EIR)and intelligent COS-aware protection. The popular protocol used toconvey control information in SONET networks is GMPLS. There are twoaspects of control mechanisms for a connection: call-control andconnection-control. Call-control is used to establish a signalingassociation between two end-points, whereas connection-control isused to setup and modify the attributes (e.g., bandwidth) of antransport connection. This draft deals with signaling requirementsfor connection-control of elastic pipes.</t>
