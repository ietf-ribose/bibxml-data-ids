      <t>With LCAS and VCAT, the transport layer is capable of not only providing right-sized data pipes, but also elastic pipes. Fluid transport pipes spur services like frame-relay transport (CIR, EIR) and intelligent COS-aware protection. The popular protocol used to convey control information in SONET networks is GMPLS. There are two aspects of control mechanisms for a connection: call-control and connection-control. Call-control is used to establish a signaling association between two end-points, whereas connection-control is used to setup and modify the attributes (e.g., bandwidth) of an transport connection. This draft deals with signaling requirements for connection-control of elastic pipes.</t>
