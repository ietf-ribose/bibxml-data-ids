    <abstract>
      <t>The Bordercast Resolution Protocol (BRP) provides the bordercasting packet delivery service used to support network querying applications. The BRP uses a map of an extended routing zone, provided by the local proactive Intrazone Routing Protocol (IARP), to construct bordercast (multicast) trees, along which query packets are directed. Within the context of the hybrid ZRP, the BRP is used to guide the route requests of the global reactive Interzone Routing Protocol (IERP). The BRP employs special query control mechanisms to steer route requests away from areas of the network that have already been covered by the query. The combination of multicasting and zone based query control makes bordercasting an efficient and tunable service that is more suitable than flood searching for network probing applications like route discovery.</t>
