      <t>This document proposes methods to provision resources for multicast groups. It proposes mechanisms that allow multicast delivery paths to be constructed along paths that have been statically provisioned for multicast traffic. In addition to static provisioning, it allows resources to be provisioned dynamically to overcome the difficulties in predicting and provisioning a priori, the amount of resources required for dynamic multicast groups. To prevent the problem of data being multicasted on a path which has not been provisioned for the service level that data is being transmitted : i) when resources are dynamically provisioned they are provisioned at the same time as the distribution path is setup, otherwise ii) multicast delivery paths are only constructed on paths already provisioned statically.</t>
