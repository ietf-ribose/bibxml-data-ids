      <t>This document proposes methods to provision resources for multicastgroups. It proposes mechanisms that allow multicast delivery pathsto be constructed along paths that have been statically provisionedfor multicast traffic. In addition to static provisioning, it allowsresources to be provisioned dynamically to overcome the difficultiesin predicting and provisioning a priori, the amount of resourcesrequired for dynamic multicast groups.To prevent the problem of data being multicasted on a path which hasnot been provisioned for the service level that data is beingtransmitted : i) when resources are dynamically provisioned they areprovisioned at the same time as the distribution path is setup,otherwise ii) multicast delivery paths are only constructed on pathsalready provisioned statically.</t>
