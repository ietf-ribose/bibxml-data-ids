      <t>This document provides a description of a GSS-API mechanism usable through the Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (as specified in Internet-Drafts [GSSV2] and [GSSV2-C]) that is easy to deploy since it does not rely on the existence of a security infrastructure nor the existence of a security server. The GSS-API-Easy mechanism enables unilateral and mutual authentication of peers as well as per-message protections. It is based on the use of an identifier and a SharedSecret shared between the client and the server and uses a protocol where the passphrase (i.e. a long phrase used like a password) is never sent in the clear. In addition, this document describes a protocol to change the SharedSecret.</t>
