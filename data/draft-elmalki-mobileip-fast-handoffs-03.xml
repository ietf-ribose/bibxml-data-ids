      <t>This draft describes a method to achieve Fast Handoffs in MobileIPv4. Fast Handoffs are required in Mobile IPv4 in order to limit theperiod of service disruption experienced by a wireless Mobile Nodewhen moving between Foreign Agents. This requirement becomes evenmore important when supporting real-time services. Fast Handoffsinvolve anticipating the movement of MNs by sending multiple copiesof the traffic to potential Mobile Node movement locations (i.e. FAs).Both a flat and a Hierarchical Mobile IPv4 model are considered. TheHierarchical MIPv4 model in Regional Tunnel Management [1] alreadyoffers improvements to Mobile IP handoffs by providing local HomeAgent functionality. Some additions are made to the operation of thisexisting Hierarchical model to achieve Fast Handoffs and limit oravoid triangle routing within the hierarchical domain.</t>
