      <t>A core part of a presence and instant messaging protocol, such as RVP [7], must be the ability to find users online. This draft defines several aspects of finding a user online: - Schema of RVP URL - How to find a user\022s RVP address (URL) - How to find a RVP server The problem may be generalized to finding a non-user object online. In this draft, the client is the process which is searching for a RVP object. This can be a RVP server acting as a client or on behalf of a user. The server is the process which is responsible for answering queries and receiving messages for a RVP object. A RVP client may sometimes act as its own server.</t>
