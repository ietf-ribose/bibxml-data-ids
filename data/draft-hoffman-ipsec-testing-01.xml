      <t>Bringing up IPsec gateways, clients and end systems is a hard task. There are the numerous configurations issues that occur when doing this. Techniques for diagnosing regular nodes may not yeild understandable results when one or both nodes have network security features. There is a further difficulty presented by the number of configuration options presented by a typical IPsec gateway implementation, and the lack of consistent diagnostics from gateways. The network administrator, field engineers and product support staff are faced with multiple indistinguishable failure modes: is the client unable to connect because of a network outage, or because the two products have never actually tested in that scenario? Or is the naive user unaware that they are behind a network address translator?</t>
