      <t>This memo presents a way for the server to unobtrusively advertise the ways in which it differs from the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) specification defined in RFC 1459 [6]. It is a primary goal to implement this in a way which is completely backwards-compatible with the original protocol, and also with current non-standard implementations of the ISUPPORT numeric.</t>
