      <t>This document discusses problems that can occur when dual stack nodes that have IPv6 enabled by default are deployed in IPv4 or mixed IPv4 and IPv6 environments. The problems include application connection delays, poor connectivity, and network security. Its purpose is to raise awareness of these problems so that they can be fixed or worked around.</t>
