      <t>We present a second-factor authentication scheme that extends the Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) method to provide superior protection against phishing attacks. Unlike traditional one-time password flows that solely authenticate the user with the service, our approach introduces an extended flow that seamlessly authenticates both the user and the service to each other. This enhanced process ensures a secure submission of the user's second-factor authentication via a secondary and secure communication channel. By verifying the service's authenticity to the user, our scheme establishes a robust defence against potential phishing attempts, enhancing the overall security of the authentication process.</t>
