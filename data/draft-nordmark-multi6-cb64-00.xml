      <t>This document outlines a potential solution to IPv6 multihoming in order to stimulate discussion. This proposal is a middle ground between the NOID and CB128 proposals. This proposed solution relies on verification the crypto-based identifier properties (using public-key crypto during uncommon operations), while allowing locator rewriting by (border) routers, with no per-packet overhead. The solution does have something which could be viewed as a 'stack name' type of identifier, but this isn't exposed to upper layer protocols. Instead it ensures that all upper layer protocols can operate unmodified in a multihomed setting while still seeing a stable IPv6 address, even though the address internally consists of 64-bits worth of subnet locator plus 64-bits of crypto-based identifier. This solution (and this draft) is remarkably similar to draft- nordmark-multi6-noid-00.txt; only issues related to prevention of redirection attacks differ.</t>
