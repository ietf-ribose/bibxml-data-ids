      <t>This document outlines a potential solution to IPv6 multihoming inorder to stimulate discussion. This proposal is a middle groundbetween the NOID and CB128 proposals.This proposed solution relies on verification the crypto-basedidentifier properties (using public-key crypto during uncommonoperations), while allowing locator rewriting by (border) routers,with no per-packet overhead. The solution does have something whichcould be viewed as a 'stack name' type of identifier, but this isn'texposed to upper layer protocols. Instead it ensures that all upperlayer protocols can operate unmodified in a multihomed setting whilestill seeing a stable IPv6 address, even though the addressinternally consists of 64-bits worth of subnet locator plus 64-bitsof crypto-based identifier.This solution (and this draft) is remarkably similar to draft-nordmark-multi6-noid-00.txt; only issues related to prevention ofredirection attacks differ.</t>
