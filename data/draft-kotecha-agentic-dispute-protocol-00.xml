      <t>This document specifies the Agentic Dispute Protocol (ADP), a standardized framework for autonomous agents and AI systems to file, process, and resolve disputes through structured, automated processes. The protocol defines message formats, transport mechanisms, evidence submission standards, and cryptographic proof requirements for internet-native dispute resolution. ADP is designed to handle disputes arising from AI agent interactions, service level agreement breaches, and automated contract enforcement, providing deterministic, auditable, and legally enforceable outcomes. ADP includes chain of custody tracking, dual-format award specifications (JSON and PDF), arbitrator discovery mechanisms, and support for multiple resolution frameworks including expert determination, binding arbitration, mediation, and hybrid approaches.</t>
