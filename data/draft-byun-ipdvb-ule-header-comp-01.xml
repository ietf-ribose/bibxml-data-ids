      <t>Multi-Protocol Encapsulation (MPE) is widely deployed in DVB-S and DVB-S2 networks [DVB-S2]. Replacing MPE with Unidirectional Lightweight Encryption (ULE) has been proposed to gain flexibility and reduce overhead. This paper introduces a signaling method for sending header-compressed unicast packets over satellite networks using ULE, taking advantage of ULE's increased flexibility.</t>
