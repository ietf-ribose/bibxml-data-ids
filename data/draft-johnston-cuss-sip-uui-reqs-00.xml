      <t>This document introduces the transport of call control related Userto User Information (UUI) in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),and develops several requirements for a new SIP mechanism. Some SIPsessions are established by or related to a non-SIP application.This application may have information that needs to be transportedbetween the SIP User Agents during session establishment. A commonexample in another protocol is the ITU-T Q.931 User to UserInformation Service. As networks move to SIP it is important thatapplications requiring this data can continue to function in SIPnetworks as well as the ability to interwork with this ISDN servicefor end-to-end transparency. This document discusses requirementsand approaches. This extension will also be used for native SIPendpoints implementing similar services and interworking with ISDNservices. Example use cases include an exchange between two useragents, retargeting by a proxy, and redirection. An exampleapplication is an Automatic Call Distributor (ACD) in a contactcenter.</t>
