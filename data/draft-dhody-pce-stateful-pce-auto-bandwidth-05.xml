      <t>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. The stateful PCE extensions provide stateful control of Multi- Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) via PCEP, for the case where PCC delegates control over one or more locally configured LSPs to the PCE. This document describes automatic bandwidth adjustment of such LSPs when employing an Active Stateful PCE. In one of the models described, PCC computes the bandwidth to be adjusted and informs the PCE whereas in the second model, PCC reports the real-time traffic to a PCE and the PCE computes the adjustment bandwidth. This document also describes automatic bandwidth adjustment for stateful PCE-initiated LSPs.</t>
