      <t>This document specifies extensions to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery that allow routers to ask hosts to periodically register. Two types of registrations are defined: to register with an AAA server using an AAA protocol, and to register with the routers using unsolicited Neighbor Advertisement messages to allow hosts to move between some links while keeping the same IPv6 address. In the latter case the routers would use the registrations to inject host routes in a 'local area'. The purpose of this document is to stimulate discussion on how to make IPv6 a good choice for wireless networks that have requirements on 'local' mobility and/or AAA functionality.</t>
