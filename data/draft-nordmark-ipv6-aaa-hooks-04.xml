      <t>This document specifies extensions to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery thatallow routers to ask hosts to periodically register. Two types ofregistrations are defined: to register with an AAA server using anAAA protocol, and to register with the routers using unsolicitedNeighbor Advertisement messages to allow hosts to move between somelinks while keeping the same IPv6 address. In the latter case therouters would use the registrations to inject host routes in a 'localarea'.The purpose of this document is to stimulate discussion on how tomake IPv6 a good choice for wireless networks that have requirementson 'local' mobility and/or AAA functionality.</t>
