      <t>This draft outlines a new routing architecture which I like tocall TARA = Topology Aggregating Routing Architecture. Its primaryobjective is to eliminate the so-called scalability problem asproclaimed by RFC4984. By overcoming the true causes of this problem - which are indeed some holy routing paradigms - it may serve as the base for much better routing.</t>
