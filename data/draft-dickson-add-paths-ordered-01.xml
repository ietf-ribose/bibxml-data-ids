      <t>This Internet Draft describes an enhanced format for encoding prefix information, to permit multiple copies of a prefix with different paths to be announced and withdrawn. Prefix instances using the new format include both unique identifiers, and ordinals to control path selection. Withdrawal of prefixes requires a slight modification to disambiguate prefix instances.Author's Note This Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft or a related draft(s) being placed on the Standards Track for idr. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [4].</t>
