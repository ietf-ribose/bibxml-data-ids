      <t>NFS Version 4 [RFC3010] provided support for client/server interactions to support replication and migration, but left unspecified how replication and migration would be done. This document is an initial draft of a protocol which could be used to transfer filesystem data and metadata for use with replication and migration services for NFS Version 4.</t>
