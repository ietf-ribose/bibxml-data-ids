      <t>OSPF is the Interior Gateway Protocol currently supported by the IETFand is widely deployed across the internet. The current strongestauthentication method for OSPFv2 is the cryptographic authentication(RFC2328.D [4]) which uses shared secret key to authenticate thepackets. This memo explains the different security flaws we found inthe anti-replay and the MACs calculation. The second part presentspractical exploitations of these weaknesses: an attacker directlyconnected to a link, can (i) replay LSAs, (ii) break neighborhoodand (iii) flap routes.</t>
