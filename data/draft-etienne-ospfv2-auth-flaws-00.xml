      <t>OSPF is the Interior Gateway Protocol currently supported by the IETF and is widely deployed across the internet. The current strongest authentication method for OSPFv2 is the cryptographic authentication (RFC2328.D [4]) which uses shared secret key to authenticate the packets. This memo explains the different security flaws we found in the anti-replay and the MACs calculation. The second part presents practical exploitations of these weaknesses: an attacker directly connected to a link, can (i) replay LSAs, (ii) break neighborhood and (iii) flap routes.</t>
