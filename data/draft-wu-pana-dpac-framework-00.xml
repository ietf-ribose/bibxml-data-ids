      <t>This informational draft describes the DPAC (Data Packet Access Control) framework, potentially under PANA, to efficiently control 'data packets' to access the network. Instead of using potentially more expensive crypto-based mechanisms such as IPSec (layer 3) or IEEE 802.11i (layer 2), DPAC introduces the possibility of using and negotiating a range of light-weight per-data-packet source authentication methods to control the data packets from PANA Clients (PaC). In DPAC, each data packet sent from PaCs to Enhanced Point (EP) can be classified, with high probability, as either valid or invalid. Furthermore, under this framework, it is possible for EP and PAA to account reliably on the network usage of each PaC.</t>
