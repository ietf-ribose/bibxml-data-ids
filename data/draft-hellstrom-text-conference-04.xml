      <t>This memo specifies methods for text media handling in multi-partycalls, where the text is carried by the RTP protocol. Real-time textis carried in a time-sampled mode according to RFC 4103. Centralizedmulti-party handling of real-time text is achieved through a mediacontrol unit coordinating multiple RTP text streams into one singlestream RTP session, identifying each stream with its own CSRC.Identification for the streams are provided through the RTCPmessages. This mechanism enables the receiving application topresent the received real-time text medium in different waysaccording to user preferences. Some presentation related featuresare also described explaining suitable variations of transmission andpresentation of text. Call control features are described for theSIP environment, while the transport mechanisms should be suitablefor any IP based call control environment using RTP transport. Twoalternative methods using a single RTP stream and sourceidentification inline in the text stream are also described.</t>
