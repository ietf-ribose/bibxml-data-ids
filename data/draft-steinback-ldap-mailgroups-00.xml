      <t>Directory services based on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [1] and X.500 [2] provide a general-purpose means to store information about users and other network entities. One such use is to store information on groups. There are LDAP standards established for this purpose, e.g. the groupOfUniqueNames [3]. However, currently there are no standards for a very important use of Groups, as SMTP Mailing Lists or Aliases. This document discusses how we at Netscape have made this extension, with the intent of providing useful information towards perhaps creating standards for this important use of LDAP.</t>
