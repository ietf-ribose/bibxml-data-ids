    <abstract>
      <t>Each IPTV operator has their own arrangements for pre-provisioning program information including addresses of the multicast groups corresponding to broadcast programs on the subscriber receiver. During the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, scenarios can occur where the IP version supported by the receiver differs from that supported by the source. This memo examines and evaluates alternative strategies for allowing the receiver to acquire multicast address information in the version it supports in such scenarios. Operators may find this review useful when planning their own transition strategy.</t>
