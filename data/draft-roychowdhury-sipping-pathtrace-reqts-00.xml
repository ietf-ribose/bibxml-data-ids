      <t>There is no defined mechanism today by which SIP proxies can insertpath related information in a SIP message that is being routedacross a network.As an example, a network administrator may want to trace the path asa SIP message traverses across her network to detect failurepoints.As another example, a user may want to discover capabilities ofservers in the path of a call. Although there is an informal mentionof using the OPTIONS method to achieve the latter example [1], thereis no defined way to achieve the same today.</t>
