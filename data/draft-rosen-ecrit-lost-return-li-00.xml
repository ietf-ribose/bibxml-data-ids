      <t>This document defines an extension to LoST (RFC5222) to permit alocation information to be returned in a findservice response. Whenthe validation is requested in the findservice request, the locationinformation supplied in the request may have enough valid addresscomponents (CAtypes) to be considered valid, but the LoST server maywish to return address components CAtypes not found in the query.</t>
