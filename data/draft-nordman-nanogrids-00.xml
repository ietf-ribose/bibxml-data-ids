      <t>A nanogrid is a very small electricity domain that is distinct from any other grid it is connected to in voltage, reliability, quality, or price. Nanogrids could form the basis of a future electricity system built on a bottom-up, decentralized, and distributed network model rather than the top-down centralized grid we have today in most parts of the world. This document introduces the idea of a nanogrid to the IETF community for two purposes -- to inform the work on energy management presently underway in the EMAN working group, and to describe how future communications within and between grids could be accomplished with protocols that are the product of the IETF. There appears to be no fundamental conflict between the nanogrid concept and the current drafts in the EMAN working group.</t>
