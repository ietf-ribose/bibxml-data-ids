      <t>Multipath TCP extends the TCP protocol to allow multiple paths to beused simultaneously for the same TCP connection. The different pathsare typically provided using multiple IP addresses for the same endsystem, each address taken from a subnet that is routed differently.In this document we describe a set of conventions for how to ensurethat outgoing packets are routed in a manner consistent with thenetwork topology and constraints on use of that topology such asthose imposed by ingress filtering on IP address prefixes.</t>
