    <abstract>
      <t>Autonomic network infrastructure (ANI) is a generic platform for tenant applications (i.e. AFs). As we will see in some examplery use cases, AFs may not only require communication capability supported from the infrastructure side, but also the capability the infrastructure can hold and re-distribute information on-demand. This document proposes a solution for information distribution in the ANI. Information distribution is categorized into two different modes: 1) instantaneous distribution and 2) publication for retrieval. In the former case, the information is sent, propagated and disposed of after reception. In the latter case, information needs to be stored in the network. The capability to distribute information is a basic and fundamental need for an autonomous network ([RFC7575]). This document describes typical use cases of information distribution in ANI and requirements to ANI, such that rich information distribution can be natively supported. The document proposes extensions to the autonomic nodes and suggests an implementation based on GRASP ([I-D.ietf-anima-grasp]) extensions as a protocol on the wire.</t>
