      <t>There are currently several protocols developed by different standards organizations that implement a basic design pattern where a client requests location from a location server and the server responds with location information. This document defines the Common Location Interoperability Framework (CLIF), a general data model for such protocols, and describes how some existing geolocation protocols can be mapped into this unified model.</t>
