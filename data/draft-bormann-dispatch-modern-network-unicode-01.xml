    <abstract>
      <t>RFC 5198 both defines common conventions for the use of Unicode in network protocols and caters for the specific requirements of the legacy protocol Telnet. In applications that do not need Telnet compatibility, some of the decisions of RFC 5198 are cumbersome. The present specification defines "Modern Network Unicode" (MNU), which is a form of RFC 5198 network unicode that can be used in specifications that require the exchange of plain text over networks and where just mandating UTF-8 (RFC 3629) may not be sufficient, but there is also no desire to import all of the baggage of RFC 5198. In addition to a basic "Clean Modern Network Unicode" (CMNU), this specification defines a number of variances that can be used to tailor MNU to specific areas of application.</t>
