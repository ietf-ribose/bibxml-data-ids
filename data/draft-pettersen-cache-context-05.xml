      <t>A common problem for sensitive web services is informing the client,in a reliable fashion, when a password protected resource is nolonger valid because the user is logged out of the service. This is,in particular, considered a potential security problem by somesensitive services, such as online banking, when the user navigatesthe client's history list, which is supposed to display the resourceas it was when it was loaded, not as it is at some later point intime.This document presents a method for collecting such sensitiveresources into a group, called a "Cache Context", which permits theserver to invalidate all the resources belonging in the group eitherby direct action, or according to some expiration policy. Thecontext can be configured to invalidate not just the resources, butalso specific cookies, HTTP authentication credentials and HTTP overTLS session information.</t>
