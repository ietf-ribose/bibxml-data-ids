      <t>This document describes a set of new authentication methods to beused within Phase 1 of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE). The proposedmethods assume an asymmetry between the authenticating entities. Oneentity, typically an Edge Device (e.g. firewall), authenticates usingstandard public key techniques (in signature mode), while the otherentity, typically a remote User, authenticates using challengeresponse techniques. These authentication methods are used toestablish, at the end of Phase 1, an IKE SA which is unidirectionallyauthenticated. To make this IKE bi-directionally authenticated, thisPhase 1 is immediately followed by an X-Auth Exchange [XAUTH]. TheX-Auth Exchange is used to authenticate the remote User. The use ofthese authentication methods is referred to as Hybrid Authenticationmode.This proposal is designed to provide a solution for environmentswhere a legacy authentication system exists, yet a full public keyinfrastructure is not deployed.</t>
