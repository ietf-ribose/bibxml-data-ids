      <t>Building and managing highly dynamic and heterogeneous decentralized systems can prove to be quite challenging due to the great complexity and scale of such environments. This document specifies a Generic Framework for Building Dynamic Decentralized Systems (GFDS), which composes a reference architecture and execution model for developing and managing these systems, while providing high-level abstractions to users.</t>
