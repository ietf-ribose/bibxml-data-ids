      <t>This protocol intended to provide cooperation between mobile routers in a mobile network. A mobile network is usually connected to the Internet through mobile routers with wireless interfaces. Link quality of the wireless interface changes frequently and rapidly. In case of several mobile routers in a mobile network, MNN should use the MR that has the best link quality. This protocol makes all MRs in a mobile network share link quality of MRs each other. Propagation of routing information in a mobile network is not out of sight of this draft.</t>
