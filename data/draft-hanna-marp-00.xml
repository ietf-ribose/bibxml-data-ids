      <t>The Multicast Address Request Protocol (MARP) serves as a front end to the Multicast Address Allocation Architecture. Any host that wishes to allocate a multicast address may contact a Multicast Address Allocation Server and use MARP to request an address allocation for a specific interval, scope, etc. Later, the host may request an extension of the address allocation or deallocate the address if it is no longer needed.</t>
