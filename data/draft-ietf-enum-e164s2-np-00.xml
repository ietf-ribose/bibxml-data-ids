      <t>This document contains a text version of the Number PortabilitySupplement (11/98) to ITU-T Recommendation E.164 (The internationalpublic telecommunication numbering plan, 05/97) [2]. ThatSupplement [3] defined terminology for number portability within anE.164 numbering scheme; identified formats, call flows,architectures, and routing approaches for some methods; and gaveexamples of some processes needed to implement number portability.A January 2000 workshop on IP-Telecomms interworking (focused onnumbering, naming, addressing, and routing) identified issues to beaddressed by the IETF and/or the ITU [4]. This Supplement was notedas a document related to a joint IETF/ITU issue on E.164 numberportability. A text version was posted on the ITU's web site inMarch 2000 and notified to the itu+ietf and enum mailing lists.This Internet Draft is being submitted to support work of the ENUM(Telephone Number Mapping) Working Group on impacts of local numberportability on a DNS-based architecture and protocols for mapping atelephone number to a set of attributes (e.g., URLs) [5].</t>
