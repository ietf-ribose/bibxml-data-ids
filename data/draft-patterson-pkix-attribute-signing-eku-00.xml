      <t>This document specifies a value for the extendedKeyUsage X.509extension that may be used to create a certificate that would be usedto sign attribute assertions. This allows the differentiation ofcertificates used to identify a particular server (which would have aserverAuth EKU), from the certificate used by that server to signattribute assertions, and would easily allow a policy to be developedfor issuance of such a certificate to an identity provider.</t>
