      <t>There is a need for standardized mechanisms to manipulate, install, edit, and delete the configuration of a network device. In addition, there is a need to retrieve device state information and receive asynchronous device state messages in a manner consistent with the configuration mechanisms. There is great interest in using an XML based data encoding because a significant set of tools for manipulating ASCII text and XML encoded data already exists.</t>
