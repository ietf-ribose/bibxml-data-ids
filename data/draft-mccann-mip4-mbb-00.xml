      <t>A make-before-break handoff is one where resources on a target systemare allocated prior to releasing the resources on a source system.Make-before-break can be an effective means to provide a moreseamless handoff with fewer dropped packets. The existing MobileIPv4 specification supports simultaneous bindings, which canfacilitate a make-before-break handoff. However, the binding stateat the home agent is only one example of a resource that can beallocated; others include the link connection to the Foreign Agent(or access router) and the provision of security associations betweenthe mobile node and the mobility agents. It may be desirable to setup these resources on the target system without necessarily creatinga binding entry on the Home Agent. This document provides someadditional conventions on the use of simultaneous bindings in a make-before-break handoff that can be used to optimize the allocation ofresources in these scenarios.</t>
