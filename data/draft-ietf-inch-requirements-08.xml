    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the high-level functional requirements of an abstract format, the Format for Incident information Exchange (FINE), which will facilitate the exchange of incident information among computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) and involved parties. A common and well-defined format will help in the exchange of incident related information across different administrative domains such as organizations, regions, and countries. Implementations of FINE will also be useful for reactionary analysis of current threats and support the proactive identification of trends that can lead to incident prevention.</t>
