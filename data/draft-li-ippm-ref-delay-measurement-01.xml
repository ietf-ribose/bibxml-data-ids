      <t>The end-to-end network one-way delay is an important performance metric in the 5G network. For realizing the accurate one-way delay measurement, existing methods requires the end-to-end deployment of accurate clock synchronization mechanism, such as PTP or GPS, which results in relatively high deployment cost. Another method can derive the one-way delay from the round-trip delay. In this case, since the delay of the downlink and uplink of the 5G network may be asymmetric, the measurement accuracy is relatively low. Hence, this document introduces a method to measure the end-to-end network one- way delay based on a reference delay guaranteed by deterministic networking without clock synchronization.</t>
