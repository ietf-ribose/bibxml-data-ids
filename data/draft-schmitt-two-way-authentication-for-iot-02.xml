      <t>In this draft the first key idea for a full two-way authentication security scheme for the Internet of Things (IoT) based on existing Internet standards, specifically the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) protocol, is introduced. By relying on an established standard, existing implementations, engineering techniques, and security infrastructure can be reused, which enables an easy security uptake. The proposed security scheme is, therefore, based on RSA, the most widely used public key cryptography algorithm. It is designed to work over standard communication stacks that offer UDP/IPv6 networking for Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPANs). RSA is a bulky solution at the moment but shows that it is possible using it on constraint devices for security purposes. An optimization would be to use elliptic curve cryptography. For sure the proposed handshake will stay the same.</t>
