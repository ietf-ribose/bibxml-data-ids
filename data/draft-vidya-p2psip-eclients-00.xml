      <t>RELOAD [1] defines a class of devices termed as clients that mayattach to peers and use the overlay, without having to provideoverlay routing or storage. These devices may attach to the identityowner on the overlay or to any arbitrary peer. This documentprovides a mechanism to attach to any arbitrary peer with some stateon the overlay for routing purposes. This avoids needing applicationspecific means of providing a destination list for contactinformation for the client and also inherently handles clientmobility.</t>
