      <t>The IESG has identified several security issues with the current Mobile IPv6 specification [MIPv6]. A subsequent effort [MIPv6SecReq] details the security threats introduced by MIPv6. Two major issues are (1) how to obtain a security association between an arbitrary MN and CN such that the binding update (BU) is secure, and, assuming such a mechanism is in place, (2) how to secure the individual BU messages. This document is an assessment of the proposed solutions for problem (1).</t>
