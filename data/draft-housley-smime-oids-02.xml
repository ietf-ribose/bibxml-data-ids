      <t>When the S/MIME Mail Security Working Group was chartered, an object identifier arc was donated by RSA Data Security for use by that working group. This document describes the object identifiers that were assigned in that donated arc, transfers control of that arc to IANA, and establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments within that arc.</t>
