      <t>IEEE-754 NaN formations are not numbers and have no equivalence class. They are not comparable to anything, including reflexively, and therefore each attribute - sign bit, signaling/quiet bit, payload bits, and representation width (binary16, binary32, binary64) - can carry meaning for an implementation. CBOR permits encoding NaNs as floating-point values, but generic processing, preferred serialization, and deterministic profiles may canonicalize or otherwise alter NaN encodings, losing information. This document defines a CBOR tag, colloquially "nan-bstr", whose content is a byte string carrying the exact IEEE-754 NaN bit pattern so that all attributes are preserved across encode/decode, enabling use cases like NaN boxing, platform-specific error signaling, diagnostics, and forensics.</t>
