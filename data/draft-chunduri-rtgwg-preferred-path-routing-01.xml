      <t>Capacity demands, Traffic Engineering (TE) and determinism are some of key requirements for various cellular, edge and industrial deployments. These deployments span from many underlying data pane technologies including native IPv4, native IPv6 along with MPLS and Segment Routing (SR). This document provides a framework for Preferred Path Routing (PPR). PPR is a method of providing path based dynamic routing for a number of packet types including IPv4, IPv6 and MPLS. This seamlessly works with a controller plane which holds both complete network view of operator policies, while distributed control plane providing self- healing benefits in a near-real time fashion. PPR builds on existing encapsulations at the edge nodes to add path identity to the packet. This reduces the per packet overhead required for path steering and therefore has a smaller impact on both packet MTU, data plane processing and overall goodput for small payload packets, while extending path steering benefits to any existing data plane. A number of extensions that allow expansion of use beyond simple point-to-point-paths are also described in this memo.</t>
