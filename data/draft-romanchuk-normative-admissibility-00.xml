      <t>This document defines a normative framework for evaluating the admissibility of speech acts produced by autonomous agents in goal- directed activity. The framework establishes rules for determining whether an agent's statement is admissible based on its modality (assertive, conditional, refusal, descriptive) and its grounding state, independent of semantic truth. This framework enables deterministic, auditable evaluation of agent contributions without requiring truth verification or semantic interpretation.</t>
