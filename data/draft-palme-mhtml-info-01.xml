      <t>The memo 'MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate Documents, such as HTML (MHTML)' [RFC 2557] specifies how to send packaged aggregate HTML objects in MIME format. This memo is an accompanying informational document, intended to be an aid to developers. This document is not an Internet standard. Issues discussed are implementation methods, caching strategies, problems with rewriting of URIs, making messages suitable both for mailers which can and which cannot handle Multipart/related and handling recipients which do not have full Internet connectivity.</t>
