    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the Segment Routing IPv6 Mobile User Plane (SRv6 MUP) architecture for Distributed Mobility Management. The requirements for Distributed Mobility Management described in [RFC7333] can be satisfied by routing fashion. Mobile services are deployed over several parts of IP networks. A Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) network can accommodate all, or part of those networks thanks to the large address space of IPv6 and the network programming capability described in [RFC8986]. Segment Routing IPv6 Mobile User Plane Architecture can incorporate existing session based mobile networks. By leveraging SRv6 network programmability, mobile user plane can be integrated into the SRv6 data plane. In that routing paradigm, session information between the entities of the mobile user plane is turned to routing information.</t>
