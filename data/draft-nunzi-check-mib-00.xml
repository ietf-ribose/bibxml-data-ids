      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community, that is targeted at increasing scalability of network monitoring via SNMP. In particular, the MIB module defined in this document describes a set of managed objects that allow to define a check procedure on a managed device. The result of the check is accumulated into a single managed object that can be read by a manager instead of reading all individual managed objects to be checked during the check procedure.</t>
