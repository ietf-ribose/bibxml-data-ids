      <t>Today, the wireless network arena is made up of different types of access (TDMA, CDMA, GSM, etc) and core network technologies (IS-41 and MAP over SS7, etc). The heterogeneous nature of today's wireless and wireline packet data networks limits the scope of mobility between these heterogeneous networks. However, as these heterogeneous networks evolve, the mobility management provided by them must evolve to insure seamless roaming between the networks. With the convergence of voice and data, networks of the future will be built on IP packet switched technology, mostly due to inherent advantages offered by the technology. This document identifies several drivers that provide input for an IP Mobility based network and also describes a high level IP Mobility architecture that extends the current third generation IMT2000 wireless architecture and builds on Mobile IP concepts.</t>
