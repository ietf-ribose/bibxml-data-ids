      <t>Internationalized Domain Names for Applications (IDNA) provides a method to map a subset of names written in Unicode into the DNS. Some languages allow a particular host name to be written in multiple ways because some characters have multiple representations, often known as "variants". This document surveys the approaches that ICANN-contracted top level domains have taken to the registration and provisioning of domain names that have variants. This document is not (and will not be) a product of the IETF, does not propose any method to make variants work "correctly", and is not an introduction to internationalization or IDNA.</t>
