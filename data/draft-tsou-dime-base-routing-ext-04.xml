      <t>This document describes two(2) extensions to the current diameter routing scheme. The first extension describes an explicit routing mechanism that MAY be employed by Diameter nodes to allow specific stateful Diameter proxies to remain in the path of all messages exchanges constituting a Diameter session. The second extension describes a realm based redirection scheme as an alternative to host based redirection described in [RFC3588].</t>
