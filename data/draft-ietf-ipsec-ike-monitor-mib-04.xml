      <t>This document defines monitoring and status MIBs for use when the (Internet Key Exchange) IKE protocol [IKE] is used to create IPsec security associations (SAs). As such, the MIBs provide the linkage between IKE (phase 1) SAs and the IPsec (phase 2) SAs created by those SAs. It does not define MIBs that may be used for configuring IPsec implementations or for providing low-level diagnostic or debugging information. It assumes no specific use of IPsec SAs, except that they were created using IKE. Further, it does not provide policy information.</t>
