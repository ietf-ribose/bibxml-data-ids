      <t>This memo provides operational guidance to server operators to help ensure that clients will be able to authenticate a server's certificate chain via published TLSA records. Guidance is also provided to clients for selecting reliable TLSA record parameters and how to use them for server authentication. Finally, guidance is given to protocol designers who wish to make use of TLSA records when securing protocols using a TLS and TLSA combination.</t>
