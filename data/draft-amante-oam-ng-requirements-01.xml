      <t>Current IP and MPLS OAM techniques need to be extended to permit operators to effectively diagnose load-balancing issues. Specifically, new ad-hoc OAM techniques are needed to diganose various link-bundling techniques, such as IP/MPLS Equal Cost Multi- Path (ECMP) and Link Aggregation Groups (LAG). In addition, these OAM tools should also be extended to permit performance monitoring over longer time durations. This document defines requirements for the next generation of OAM solutions.</t>
