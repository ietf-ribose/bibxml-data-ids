      <t>HTTP-Payments describes a mechanism for passing a standardized payment request in the headers of an HTTP 402 response and the expected behaviour of HTTP clients that receive such a response.Feedback This specification is an early experiment in bringing the work of the W3C Web Payments working group to the HTTP protocol. It is maintained at https://github.com/adrianhopebailie/http-payments [1]. The work is inspired by work in the Interledger community on [HTTP-ILP]</t>
