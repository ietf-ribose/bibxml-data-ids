    <abstract>
      <t>With the maturity of cloud native application development, applications can be decomposed into finer grained atomic services. On the other hand, as a distributed computing paradigm, fine grained micro-services could be deployed and implemented in a distributive way among edges to make computing, storage and run-time processing capabilities as close to users as possible to provide satisfied QoE. Under the circumstances analyzed, a Hybrid-Function-Chain (HFC) framework is proposed in this draft, aiming to wisely allocate and schedule resources and services in order to provide consistent end- to-end service provisioning.</t>
