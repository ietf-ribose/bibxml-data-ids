    <abstract>
      <t>There are many systems in which people use "digital credentials" to control real-world systems, such as digital car keys, digital hotel room keys, etc. In these settings, it is common for one person to want to transfer their credentials to another, e.g., to share your hotel key. It is desirable to be able to initiate this transfer with a single message (e.g., SMS) which kicks off the transfer on the receiver side. However, in many cases the credential transfer itself cannot be completed over these channels, e.g., because it is too large or because it requires multiple round trips. However, the endpoints cannot speak directly to each other and may not even be online at the same time. This draft defines a mechanism for providing an appropriate asynchronous channel using HTTP as a dropbox.</t>
