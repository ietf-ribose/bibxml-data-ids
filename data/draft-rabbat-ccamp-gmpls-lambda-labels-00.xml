      <t>Technology in the optical domain is constantly evolving and as a consequence new equipment providing lambda switching capability has been developed and is currently being deployed. RFC 3471 [RFC3471] has defined that a wavelength label (section 3.2.1.1) "only has significance between two neighbors". However, in a network composed of a new generation of lambda switch-capable equipment, this document explains new models that require standardization of the label. It highlights new operator requirements and describes signaling extensions to satisfy those requirements. This document is a companion to the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling. It defines the Label Switching Capable (LSC) technology specific information needed when using GMPLS.</t>
