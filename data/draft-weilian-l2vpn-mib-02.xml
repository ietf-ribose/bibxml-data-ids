      <t>This draft not only describes the management model which is universal to all PSN types supported by PWE3 architecture, but also defines an experimental part of MIB on Internet community network management protocol. Especially, the draft describes the managed objects of L2VPN service on packet switching network, including VPWS, VPLS and IPLS services. Different from PW MIB, the MIB provides the management models for L2VPN service, including the management models of L2VPN service instance, L2VPN PW specific parameters, L2VPN AC Access parameters and traffic statistics for L2VPN service.</t>
