      <t>This document describes a generic Cognitive Adaptive Module (CAM)that can be utilized in conjunction with Mobile Ad hoc Network(MANET) routing protocols. The main concept behind CAM is the factthat the provisioning of multimedia communications traditionallyrequires routing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees [9]. Such atask is NP Complete in MANETs when QoS optimization is subject tomore than one parameter [9]. Hence, the provisioning of soft QoSguarantees for effective and efficient routing in dynamicenvironments, as specified in [1], is the best alternative. However,the latter cannot be optimally achieved by using a single metricbased path selection process or routing approach due to variationsin both upper layer service QoS requirements and situationalconstraints. CAM provides interfaces to routing components such thatprotocols can be segmented into these components and can be easilymade configurable and adaptive. For instance, the route selectionprocess can be done in an adaptive manner to satisfy therequirements for effective and efficient routing. This is achievedby providing interfaces from the CAM core to various user definedcomponents (e.g. Repositories Component) such that all componentsand component parts (e.g. DYMO reactive routing logic) can inter-communicate.</t>
