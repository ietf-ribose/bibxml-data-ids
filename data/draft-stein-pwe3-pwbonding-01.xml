      <t>There are times when pseudowires must be transported over physicallinks with limited bandwidth. We shall use the term "bonding" (alsovariously known as inverse multiplexing, link aggregation, trunking,teaming, etc.) to mean an efficient mechanism for separating the PWtraffic over several links. Unlike load balancing and equal costmultipath, bonding makes no assumption that the PW traffic can bedecomposed into distinguishable flows, and thus bonding requiresdelay compensation and packet reordering. Furthermore, PW bondingcan optionally track bandwidth constraints in order to minimizepacket loss.</t>
