      <t>This document describes Parlay parameters (appropriately encoded Parlay Events, generated by the PSTN) which the SPIRITS protocol can transport from the PSTN into the IP network, and vice versa. These parameters are PARLAY equivalents of INAP parameters described in [1]. The SPIRITS protocol is a protocol through which PSTN can request actions (services) to be carried out in the IP network in response to events (IN Triggers) occurring within the PSTN/IN. These services include, but are not limited to: Incoming Call Notification (Internet Call Waiting), Internet Caller-Id Delivery, and Internet Call Forwarding ('Follow Me').</t>
