      <t>Peer-to-peer (p2p) protocols, like all distributed protocols, arecomplex, and therefore harder to debug and study in the wild. Thisis more true of existing p2p protocols, where changing the behaviourof the protocol --- however minor the change may be --- may result inunknown manifestations on the dynamics of the swarm using thatprotocol. In lieu of the unintended consequences of perturbing alive swarm, researchers have resorted to simulation frameworks.However, simulation results obtained from one simulator are oftenhard to reproduce when using another simulation framework. Thisdocument surveys existing simulator frameworks prevalent insimulating p2p protocols today in order to quantify any assumptionsand characteristics inherent in the simulator. This, we hope, willaid future researchers in choosing the right simulation framework fortheir abstraction.</t>
