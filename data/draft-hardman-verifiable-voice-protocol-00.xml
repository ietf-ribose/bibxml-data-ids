      <t>Verifiable Voice Protocol (VVP) authenticates and authorizes organizations and individuals making telephone calls. This eliminates trust gaps that scammers exploit. Like related technolgies such as SHAKEN, RCD, and BCID, VVP binds cryptographic evidence to a SIP INVITE, and verifies this evidence downstream. However, VVP builds from different technical and governance assumptions, and uses stronger, richer evidence. This allows VVP to cross jurisdictional boundaries easily and robustly. It also makes VVP simpler, more decentralized, cheaper to deploy and maintain, more private, more scalable, and higher assurance than alternatives. Because it is easier to adopt, VVP can plug gaps or build bridges between other approaches, functioning as glue in hybrid ecosystems. For example, it may justify an A attestation in SHAKEN, or an RCD passport for branded calling, when a call originates outside SHAKEN or RCD ecosystems. VVP also works well as a standalone mechanism, independent of other solutions. An extra benefit is that VVP enables two-way evidence sharing with verifiable text and chat (e.g., RCS and vCon), as well as with other industry verticals that need verifiability in non-telco contexts.</t>
