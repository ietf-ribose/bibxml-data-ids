      <t>Historically, the meaning of an IP address has been to identify an interface on a network device. Routing protocols were developed based on the assumption that a destination address had this semantic. Over time, routing decisions were enhanced to route packets according to additional information carried within the packets and dependent on policy coded in, configured at, or signaled to the routers. Many proposals have been made to add semantics to IP addresses. The intent is usually to facilitate routing decisions based solely on the address and without the need to find and process information carried in other fields within the packets. This document presents a brief survey of technologies related to IP semantic addressing and routing proposals. Inclusion of a proposal or technique in this document does not imply any level of support. A partner document examines the challenges for routing in this context.</t>
