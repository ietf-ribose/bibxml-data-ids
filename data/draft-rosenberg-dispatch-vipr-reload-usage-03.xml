      <t>Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a technique for inter-domain SIP federation. ViPR makes use of the RELOAD protocol to store unverified mappings from phone numbers to RELOAD nodes, with whom a validation process can be run. This document defines the usage of RELOAD for this purpose.
