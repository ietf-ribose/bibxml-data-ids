      <t>Filters for Mobile IPv4 bindings enables mobile nodes to associate one or more Filters with mobility bindings during registration. Flows that match a Filter will be processed as defined by the Filter. In this manner, it is possible for a mobile node to distribute flows or packets of a flow among its available points of attachment, or to request that such flows are dropped before reaching the mobile node.</t>
