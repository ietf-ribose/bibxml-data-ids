      <t>Seamless MPLS architecture is proposed to integrate access and aggregation/core networks into a single MPLS domain. Through the separation of the service and transport plane Seamless MPLS can provide end to end service independent transport. But when the mobile backhaul network is integrated as the access/aggregation network with the core network based on Seamless MPLS architecture, it will proposes new challenges other than the existing solutions for Seamless MPLS. This document introduces the framework of Seamless MPLS to integrate the mobile backhaul network and the core network. The possible challenges of Seamless MPLS for mobile backhaul networks are identified and new requirements are defined accordingly.</t>
