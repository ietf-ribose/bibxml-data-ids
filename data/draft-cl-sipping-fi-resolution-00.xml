      <t>Internet applications have been enhanced with many features.A feature may be defined as a unit of functionality in a system, havinga self-contained role.However, the introduction and modification of features may result inundesired behaviors, and this effect is known as feature interaction -FI for short.This document specifies the architecture of a distributed feature mana-ger that proposes the resolution of feature interactions. The resolu-tion may be done locally, or with cooperation between different nodes.The resolution method is left to the implementation. In this document we provide an example of one resolution method, based on featureinterdiction, as described by a set of deontic formulas.</t>
