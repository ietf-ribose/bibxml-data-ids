    <abstract>
      <t>Distribution of high precision time and frequency over the Internet and special purpose IP networks is becoming more and more needed as IP networks replace legacy networks and as new applications with need for frequency and time are developed on the Internet. The IETF formed the TICTOC working group to address the problem and perform an analysis on existing solutions and the needs. This document summarizes application needs, as described and agreed on at an TICTOC interim meeting held in Paris from June 16 to 18, 2008.</t>
