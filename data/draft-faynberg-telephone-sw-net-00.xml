      <t>The purpose of this Internet Draft is to start discussion on the issues involved in interconnecting Internet and Public Switched Networks so as to provide more effective media than either network type can do presently. Interworking of the Internet and PSTNs, based on open well-defined interfaces, will promote interoperability of both the networks and systems built by different vendors.</t>
