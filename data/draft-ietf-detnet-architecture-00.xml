      <t>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides a capability to carry specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency. Techniques used include: 1) reserving data plane resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate nodes (e.g. bridges or routers) along the path of the flow; 2) providing explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not rapidly change with the network topology; and 3) distributing data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of each packet's data' in spite of the loss of a path. The capabilities can be managed by configuration, or by manual or automatic network management.</t>
