      <t>The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) specifications are designed to make identity management in cloud-based applications and services easier. This document provides a platform-neutral schema for representing AI agents' identities in JSON format, enabling them to be transferred in the SCIM protocol to the service. This establishes an agentic identity so that an agent can subsequently be authenticated and authorized to interact with the service.</t>
