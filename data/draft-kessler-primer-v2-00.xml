      <t>This memo is an introductory guide to some of the TCP/IP and Internet tools and utilities that allow users to access the wide variety of information on the network, from determining if a particular host is up to viewing a multimedia thesis on foreign policy. It also describes discussion lists accessible from the Internet, ways to obtain Internet and TCP/IP documents, and some resources that help users weave their way through the Internet. This memo may be used as a tutorial for individual self-learning, a step-by-step laboratory manual for a course, or as the basis for a site's users manual. It is intended as a basic guide only and will refer to other sources for more detailed information.</t>
