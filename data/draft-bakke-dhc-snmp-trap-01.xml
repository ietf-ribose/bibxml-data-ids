      <t>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol [RFC1531] provides a methodfor a host to retrieve common configuration parameters at boot time.These include the host's IP address, default gateway, subnet mask,DNS server, and other useful things.When a host is booted from the network, it does not have access tothese configuration parameters from its local or network disk rightaway; it relies instead on DHCP to provide them. One such parameterthat is not yet provided is a list of IP hosts to which to send SNMPnotifications [RFC1448] during the boot process, particularly if theboot fails. As the host is already gleaning similar information fromDHCP, a new option to specify these SNMP 'trap' hosts appears to bethe simplest method to gain this information. Hosts not booting fromthe network benefit as well, since SNMP notification hosts can now beconfigured centrally through DHCP.This document describes a proposed DHCP option that specifies a listof SNMP notification hosts to which SNMP notifications should besent.</t>
