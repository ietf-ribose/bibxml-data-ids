    <abstract>
      <t>In Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) environment, the RSVP-TE based Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) LSP allows traffic to transmit from root to leaf node, but there is no co-routed reverse path for traffic from leaf to root node. There are applications that require bi-directional, co-routed and guaranteed communication from a root node to several leaf nodes in a hub-and- spoke fashion. This draft defines such a Hub and Spoke Multipoint LSP (HSMP LSP) and defines protocol extensions to P2MP RSVP-TE to setup such LSPs.</t>
