    <abstract>
      <t>This document introduces a new multicast routing protocol for use over ad hoc networks. The protocol is called AMRIS, short for Ad hoc Multicast Routing protocol utilizing Increasing id-numberS. The conceptual idea behind AMRIS is to assign every node in a multicast session with an id-number. A delivery tree rooted at a particular node called Sid joins up the nodes participating in the multicast session. The relationship between the id-numbers(and the node that owns it) and Sid is that the id-numbers increase in numerical value as they radiate from the root of the delivery tree. The significance of the Sid is that it has the smallest id-number within that multicast session. Utilizing the id-numbers, nodes are able to adapt rapidly to changes in link connectivity. Recovery messages due to link breakages are confined to the region where it occurred.</t>
