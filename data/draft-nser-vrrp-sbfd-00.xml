      <t>Since the VRRP protocol depends on the availability of Layer 3 IPvX connectivity between redundant peers, the VRRP protocol can interact with the variant of S-BFD as described in [RFC7881] to achieve a much faster failure detection. This document describes how to extend the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) to support Seamless Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (S-BFD) as a detection system for Primary Router failure. To announce the use of this implementation, a new type (Section 5.2.2.) of VRRP packet and a new timer are defined. To facilitate and increase the user experience while deploying this implementation, an auto-calculation algorithm for the SBFD Discriminators is also implemented.</t>
