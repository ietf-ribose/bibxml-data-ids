      <t>RFC 3427 currently defines the process for defining and registeringnew SIP header fields. This document proposes that prefixs to headerfield names should be discontinued, and that an additional categoryof experimental header field should be created. This document alsorelaxes the requirement that response codes are defined by standardstrack RFCs, also allowing them to be defined by experimental RFCs.</t>
