    <abstract>
      <t>The Internet Protocol (IP) has been the major technological success in information technology of the last half century. As the Internet becomes pervasive, IP has been replacing communication technology for many domain-specific solutions, but it also has been extended to better fit the specificities of the different use cases. For Internet addressing in particular, as it is defined in RFC 791 for IPv4 and RFC 8200 for IPv6, respectively, there exist many extensions. Those extensions have been developed to evolve the addressing capabilities beyond the basic properties of Internet addressing. This document proposes a set of use cases showcasing the continuing need to extend the Internet addressing model and the methods used for doing so. It further outlines the properties of Internet addressing as a baseline against which the extensions are categorized in terms of methodology used to extend the addressing model, together with examples of solutions doing so. The most important aspect of the analysis and discussion in this document is that it represents a snapshot of the discussion that took place in the IETF (on various mailing lists and several meetings) in the early 2020s. While the community did not converge on specific actions to be taken, the content of this document may nonetheless be of use at some point in the future should the community decides so.</t>
