    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the 'taler' Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for triggering interactions with a GNU Taler wallet. This URI scheme allows applications to trigger interactions with the GNU Taler wallet, such as withdrawing money, making payments, receiving refunds and restoring a wallet from a backup. Applications may receive such URIs in many ways (including via NFC, QR codes, Web links or messaging applications), or might generate them internally to interact with a wallet. By having a Taler wallet handle the respective URIs, applications can integrate Taler payments without having to support the Taler protocol directly. Furthermore, by passing control to a Taler wallet process, the wallet's database with its financial data might be better protected from application failures.</t>
