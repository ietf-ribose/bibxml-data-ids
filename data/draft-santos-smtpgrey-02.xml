      <t>GREYLIST is a SMTP extension to formalize the widely supported Greylisting mail filtering method and to help support SMTP rejected transports by following a new formal structured 4yz server temporary rejection response by including a "retry=time-delay" tag string which SMTP clients can use to optimize the rescheduling of the mail delivery attempts. With adoption, network overhead reduction in wasteful mail delivery attempts will be realized.</t>
