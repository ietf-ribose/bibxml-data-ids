      <t>This document proposes a control protocol to setup tunnels between aclient and a tunnel server or broker. It provides a framework forthe negociation of tunnel parameters between the two entities. It isa generic TCP protocol based on simple XML messaging. This frameworkprotocol enables the negociation of any kind of tunnel, and isextensible to support new parameters or extensions. The first targetapplication is to setup IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels which is one of thetransition mechanism identified by the ngtrans and ipv6 workinggroups. This IPv6 over IPv4 tunnel setup application of the genericTSP protocol is defined by a profile of the TSP protocol, in acompanion document.</t>
