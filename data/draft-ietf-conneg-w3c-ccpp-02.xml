      <t>This document suggests some possible areas for extending the IETF'conneg' working group's capability description framework,described in [2,3,4]. The suggested areas for extension have beenmotivated by WWW Consortium (W3C) work on CompositeCapability/Preference Profiles (CCPP) [5] that parallels someaspects of the IETF 'conneg' work.This is presented as a discussion document, with a view to maybeintegrating some of these ideas into ongoing 'conneg' work, and toindicate some areas for ongoing collaboration between the IETF andW3C in the area of content description.</t>
