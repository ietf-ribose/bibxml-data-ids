    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a classification and tagging system designed to identify and preserve the provenance of digital content (text, audio, video, and other media) to ensure the integrity of training datasets for machine learning systems. The framework described herein aims to support a standardized mechanism for tagging data with metadata that specifies whether the content was human-generated or AI-generated. This enables the exclusion of AI-generated data from training corpora where human-originated material is required, and it facilitates the maintenance of clean, verifiable sources for future AI development.</t>
