      <t>When certificates are used as credentials to attest the assignment of ownership of telephone numbers, some mechanism is required to provide certificate freshness. This document specifies short-lived certificates as a means of guaranteeing certificate freshness for secure telephone identity (STIR), in particular relying on the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) to allow signers to acquire certifcates as needed.</t>
