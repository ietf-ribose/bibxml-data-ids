      <t>This specification addresses how to communicate a basic sense of the type of each device present on the network. This is particularly important as the range of devices with connectivity greatly expands, and as indirect interests in device characteristics increase, such as energy consumption. Many applications will benefit from a single standard enumeration of basic device types. This draft does not address detailed device characteristics or subtypes. The draft also discusses related identify information. It is an initial discussion document to generate feedback and improvement.</t>
