    <abstract>
      <t>In the recent years, the concept of near-data computing has been widely recognized in storage architectures. The core idea is to process data nearby, reduce the overhead of network transmission, and utilize the computing capability of smart devices (such as intelligent NICs, smart SSDs, and DPUs). This reduces CPU and memory usage of clients (computing nodes) and improves data processing efficiency. This design idea is applied in NFSv4.2 or future NFS versions, such as Server-Side Copy, in which client sends the control command and the storage server copies data without transmitting between client and server. We are proposing a new mechanism for setting the attributes for all the files and directories in the parent directory, based on thes same thinking of the server side copy mechanism. Compared with traditional setting of attributes, data transmission over the network is reduced and the bandwidth resources are greatly released.</t>
