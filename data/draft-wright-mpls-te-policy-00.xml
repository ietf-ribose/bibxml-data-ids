    <abstract>
      <t>This document considers the application of policy based traffic engineering techniques to load-balancing in MPLS networks. The objective is not to mandate a specific policy, but to (a) provide an example of a policy based approach to a traffic engineering problem and (b) elucidate a range of potential policies related to load balancing as a traffic engineering objective as guidance for the development of a Policy Information Base (PIB) for MPLS networks.</t>
