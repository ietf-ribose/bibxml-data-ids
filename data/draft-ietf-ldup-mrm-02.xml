      <t>The goal of standards for LDAP replication is to allow interoperable replication among products from many different vendors. Defining the mechanism to move data among replicas is a necessary part of this work, but management of the replicated environment must also be standardized for replication to be truly interoperable. This document presents the replication management functions that must be performed. Whenever possible, these functions are defined in terms of existing LDAP functionality using existing LDAP operations and existing data definitions. In some cases, changes or additions to the existing model are required, and specifications for these changes are included in this document</t>
