      <t>This document presents a model for mapping the domain-qualifieduser and group names used in the Network File System version 4'sAccess Control List (ACL) entries (ACEs) to internal identifierssuch as POSIX UIDs and GIDs, as well as reverse mappings as wellas a protocol for effecting such mappings in a consistent wayacross a server cluster, site, or entire domain.The main goals of this model and protocol are to allow the use ofuser and group names from multiple domains to be used in POSIXenvironments as well as enabling multi-protocol fileserverimplementations which must support the use of a variety of userand group identifiers.</t>
