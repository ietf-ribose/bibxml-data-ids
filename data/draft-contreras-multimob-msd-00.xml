    <abstract>
      <t>A new working group, Multimob, has been chartered for providing an implementation of multicast service distribution to multicast listeners as they move in currently defined Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) domains according to RFC 5213 [1]. No protocol modifications or extensions are considered at this stage. Several proposals [2, 3, 4] have been already presented to face this issue. This contribution sums up some of the previous ideas extending them when necessary to overcome some limitations existing on such solutions.</t>
