      <t>RFC 5378, "Rights Contributors Provide to the IETF Trust", has beeninterpreted in a way that is unworkable in practice for updates todocuments created before it came into effect, and for other documentsthat derive significant amounts of text from such earlier documents.It requires, as a condition of Internet Draft posting or RFCpublication or even as a condition of posting of Internet Drafts,that authors or editors obtain rights from people who may beunavailable or uncooperative. This specification modifies the RFC5378 rules to permit the IETF to continue to do work in an orderlyfashion when documents containing earlier text are involved andpermission is not easily obtained.</t>
