      <t>The JMAP base protocol (RFC8620) is a generic, efficient, mobile friendly and scalable protocol that can be used for data of any type. This makes it a good fit for migrations or data portability use cases. However, due to its large set of features, it is also quite complex, which makes it difficult to explore new application domains in practice. The goal of this document is to provide a simplified version of JMAP for more rapid development.</t>
