    <abstract>
      <t>In IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), randomizing the interface identifier (IID) is a common practice to promote privacy. If there are a very large number of nodes, as has been discussed in several use cases, the effect will to proportionately increase the number of IIDs. A duplicate address detection (DAD) cycle is needed for each configured IID, introducing more and more overhead into the network. Each failed DAD requires the initiating node to regenerate a new IID and undergo the DAD cycle again. This document proposes an optimized approach that requires 6LBR (6LoWPAN Border Router) to provide a unique IID, avoiding the potential duplication. Additionally, further optimizations are suggested to enable multiple concurrent DAD cycles and to return the suggested IID from 6LBR to 6LN in a space-efficient manner.</t>
