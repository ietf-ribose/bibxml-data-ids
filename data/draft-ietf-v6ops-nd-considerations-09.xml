    <abstract>
      <t>Neighbor Discovery (ND) is a critical part of IPv6. ND uses multicast extensively and trusts all hosts and routers. In some scenarios, such as wireless networks, multicast can be inefficient. In other scenarios, such as public access networks, some hosts or routers may not be trustworthy. Consequently, ND can have security and operational issues in some scenarios. The issues and mitigation solutions are documented in more than 20 RFCs, making it challenging to track all these issues and solutions. Therefore, an overview document is helpful. This document first summarizes the published ND issues and the solutions. This provides a one-stop reference as of the time of writing. This document then points out that these more than 20 issues originate from just three causes. Addressing the issues is made simpler by addressing the causes. This document also analyzes the mitigation solutions to show that isolating hosts into different subnets and links can help to address the three causes, and thus prevent ND issues. Three isolation methods and their applicability are described. A simple guideline is suggested for selecting a suitable isolation method to prevent potential ND issues.</t>
