      <t>The ORGANIZE extension to Internet Message Access Protocol [IMAP4] specifies the mechanism by which the client can inform the server to maintain the entries for the messages to be organized. The organization of messages include appending, moving to a mailbox, deleting messages, or changing the attributes of received messages. This extension enables the lightweight IMAP clients to organize their messages on the server side, rather than performing it on the client side. In addition to the information on the IMAP ORGANIZE extension, this document describes implementation of the ORGANIZE extension for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol [SMTP].</t>
