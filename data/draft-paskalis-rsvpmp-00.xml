      <t>Mobility management and QoS provision have been research topics inthe past years. Mobile IP is the dominant protocol for mobilitymanagement, whereas RSVP is a well established protocol for QoSprovision. These protocols when deployed separately can work quiteefficiently. However, their interworking has been widely recognizedto be problematic. We propose a new approach that limits mobilityand QoS related network modifications inside the domain in which auser moves.</t>
