      <t>Mobility management and QoS provision have been research topics in the past years. Mobile IP is the dominant protocol for mobility management, whereas RSVP is a well established protocol for QoS provision. These protocols when deployed separately can work quite efficiently. However, their interworking has been widely recognized to be problematic. We propose a new approach that limits mobility and QoS related network modifications inside the domain in which a user moves.</t>
