    <abstract>
      <t>The Domain Name System (DNS) relies on caching to function efficiently. However, DNS cache poisoning remains a significant threat. The "bailiwick" rule is a fundamental security mechanism intended to prevent resolvers from caching out-of-bailiwick data sent by malicious or misconfigured authoritative servers. Current DNS standards provide high-level guidance on bailiwick checking but lack specific algorithmic definitions, leading to inconsistent implementations across different DNS software. These inconsistencies can be exploited, particularly in DNS servers that operate in multiple modes, such as Conditional DNS Servers (CDNS), which may act as both recursive resolvers and forwarders and often share a common cache. This document specifies enhanced and more precise rules for bailiwick checking in DNS resolvers, including those operating as forwarders or CDNS. The goal is to provide clearer guidelines for implementers, reduce the attack surface for cache poisoning, and improve the overall security and robustness of the DNS infrastructure. The recommendations herein are informed by recent research highlighting vulnerabilities in existing bailiwick implementations.</t>
