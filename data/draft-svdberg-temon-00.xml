      <t>This memo describes some requirements that need to be taken into account when developing a measurement architecture for use in IP-traffic engineering. It looks at the methods for collecting measurement information and possible problems that might be encountered while doing so. It links the measurement requirements to the efforts made in other IETF-working groups and tries to state some guidelines for defining a formal framework to describe how measurements can be organised for traffic engineering purposes.</t>
