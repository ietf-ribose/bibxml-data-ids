    <abstract>
      <t>The DELEG Working Group is soon going to be choosing a base protocol that describes how resolvers will be able to get a new DNS resource record to create a new process for DNS delegation. After a resolver gets this new type of record, it needs to know how to process the record in order to get a set of nameservers for a zone. This document lists many of the considerations for that process, including many open questions for the DELEG Working Group. More considerations and open questions might be added in later versions of this draft. Note that this draft is _not_ intended to become an RFC. It is being published so that the DELEG Working Group has a place to point its efforts about how resolvers get nameservers for a zone while it continues to work on choosing a base protocol. The work that results from this might be included in the base protocol specification, or in a new draft authored by some of the many people who have done earlier work in this area.</t>
