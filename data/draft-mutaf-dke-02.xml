      <t>This document describes a verbal key exchange protocol in which ashort fingerprint is used to represent a "one-time" public keyfingerprint. The one-time public key is immediately used for keyexchange, before an attacker has time to find a public/private keypair that gives the same fingerprint and mount a Man-in-the-Middleattack. The protocol, however, requires that both users be presentfor fingerprint verification, making it suitable for mobile usersonly.</t>
