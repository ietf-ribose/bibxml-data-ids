    <abstract>
      <t>Operations, Administration and Maintenance is an integral part of transport connections, hence it is required that Operations, Administration and Maintenance functions are activated/deactivated in sync with connection commissioning/decommissioning; avoiding spurious alarms and ensuring consistent operation. In certain technologies, Operations, Administration and Maintenance entities are inherently established once the connection is set up, while other technologies require extra configuration to establish and configure Operations, Administration and Maintenance entities. This document specifies extensions to RSVP-TE to support the establishment and configuration of Operations, Administration and Maintenance entities along with Label Switched Path signaling.</t>
