      <t>The purpose of this draft is to describe a methodology specific to the benchmarking of MPLS forwarding devices. The scope of this benchmarking will be limited to various types of packet-forwarding and delay measurements. It builds upon the tenets set forth in RFC2544 [RFC2544], RFC1242 [RFC1242] and other IETF Benchmarking Methodology Working Group (BMWG) efforts. This document seeks to extend these efforts to the MPLS paradigm.</t>
