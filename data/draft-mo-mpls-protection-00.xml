      <t>Protection issues for MPLS LSP have been discussed in recent IETF meetings. Various drafts have different proposals on establishing the working and protection LSP ([1]-[5]). But how to reserve bandwidth for the protection LSP has not be discussed. If the bandwidth for the protection LSP is reserved in a similar fashion as that of the working LSP, the bandwidth utilization in the network would be very poor. In this draft, an algorithm for reserve bandwidth for protection LSP is presented which enables very efficient bandwidth reservation for single fault protection.</t>
