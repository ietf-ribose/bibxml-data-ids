      <t>Protection issues for MPLS LSP have been discussed in recent IETF meetings.Various drafts have different proposals on establishing the workingand protection LSP ([1]-[5]). But how to reserve bandwidth for theprotection LSP has not be discussed. If the bandwidth for theprotection LSP is reserved in a similar fashion as that of the workingLSP, the bandwidth utilization in the network would be very poor.In this draft, an algorithm for reserve bandwidth for protection LSPis presented which enables very efficient bandwidth reservation forsingle fault protection.</t>
