      <t>RADIUS contains a one-octet Identifier field which is used to correlate requests and replies. This field limits the number of outstanding requests to 256. Experience shows that this limitation is problematic for high load systems. This document proposes to use the Request Authenticator field as an additional unique identifier. The replies can then be correlated to requests by copying the Request Authenticator from the request to a new attribute in the response, called the Original-Request-Authenticator.</t>
