      <t>A common design pattern in Internet of Things (IoT) deployments is the use of a constrained device that collects data via sensor or controls actuators for use in home automation, industrial control systems, smart cities and other IoT deployments. This document defines a Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS) 1.2 profile that offers communications security for this data exchange thereby preventing eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery. The lack of communication security is a common vulnerability in Internet of Things products that can easily be solved by using these well-researched and widely deployed Internet security protocols.</t>
