      <t>OSPF [Ref1] is a link-state intra-domain routing protocol used forrouting in IP networks. Though the definition of the ABR in thecurrent OSPF specification does not require a router with multipleattached areas to have a backbone connection, it is actuallynecessary to provide successful routing to the inter-area andexternal destinations. If this requirement is not met all traffic,destined for the areas not connected to such an ABR or out of theOSPF domain, is dropped. The rules of originating and processingSummary-LSAs given in the current OSPF standard [Ref1] can alsoresult in suboptimal inter-area routing. Though all these problemscan be fixed using virtual links, this memo describes an alternativeimplementation of the OSPF ABR behavior, which allows theadministrator to avoid it or, if virtual links are still used, todecrease the number of configured virtual links.This memo also describes possible situations where the proposedimplementation can be used.</t>
