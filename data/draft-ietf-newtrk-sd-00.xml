      <t>The "ISD" model for specifying the definition, status, and content of Internet Standards does not appear to be satisfactory for the documents that describe IETF procedures, structure, or relationships with other bodies. Those documents have traditionally be published as BCPs and described as "process" BCPs. This document proposes an special document series for those process documents, paralleling the ISDs.</t>
