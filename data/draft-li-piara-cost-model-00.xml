      <t>The IP address space is a fixed size, fully recyclable resource which must be shared amongst the entire Internet community in order to achieve global connectivity. Similarly, the routing table entries in the routers that comprise the backbone are a scarce resource. Squandering either of these resources can lead to an Internet in which some systems have significantly reduced reachability.</t>
