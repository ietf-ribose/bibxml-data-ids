      <t>This document discusses the interaction of transition mechanisms that can be involved during the transition phase where both IPv4 and IPv6 will be concurrently used. On one hand, several transition mechanisms have been defined to solve particular transition issues. On the other hand, one can face multiple transition issues and may have to use several transition mechanisms. Since an applicability scope is attached to each transition mechanism, specifying where the mechanism applies, i.e. host, domain or global, this memo aims at identifying cases where multiple transition mechanisms may be involved within the same scope, and what the interaction effects among them can be.</t>
