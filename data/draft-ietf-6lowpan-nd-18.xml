      <t>The IETF 6LoWPAN working group defines IPv6 over Low-power Wireless Personal Area Networks such as IEEE 802.15.4. This and other similar link technologies have limited or no usage of multicast signaling due to energy conservation. In addition, the wireless network may not strictly follow traditional concept of IP subnets and IP links. IPv6 Neighbor Discovery was not designed for non-transitive wireless links. The traditional IPv6 link concept and heavy use of multicast make the protocol inefficient and sometimes impractical in a low power and lossy network. This document describes simple optimizations to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery, addressing mechanisms and duplicate address detection for 6LoWPAN and similar networks. The document, thus updates RFC 4944 to specify the use of the optimizations defined here.</t>
