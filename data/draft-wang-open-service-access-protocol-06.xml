    <abstract>
      <t>With the development of IoT (Internet of Things) technology, everything becomes interconnected. Mass IoT data, devices, businesses, and services adopt different data descriptions and service access methods, resulting in fragmentation issues such as data heterogeneity, device heterogeneity, and application heterogeneity. These issues hinder the development of the industry. To solve this problem, this draft proposes the requirements for IoT smart devices to transmit and control, as well as transmission and protocol interfaces. It is intended for program design, system testing and acceptance, and related research. The structured, unified, and standardized open service interconnection model reduces business replication costs and eliminates service barriers, thus promoting industrial development.</t>
