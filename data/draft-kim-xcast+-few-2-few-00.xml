      <t>Xcast+[2] is newly proposed multicast scheme to supportIGMPv2/MLDv3 in Explicit Multicast(Xcast)[1]. Xcast+ is suitablefor one-to-few multicast applications. In order to support few-to-few communication naturally, the control plane of existing Xcast+should be extended. In this document, a new control plane for few-to-few communication for Xcast+ is specified. In order to acheivethis, the concept of logical core (LC) is newly introduced.</t>
