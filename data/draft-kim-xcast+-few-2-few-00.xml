      <t>Xcast+[2] is newly proposed multicast scheme to support IGMPv2/MLDv3 in Explicit Multicast(Xcast)[1]. Xcast+ is suitable for one-to-few multicast applications. In order to support few-to- few communication naturally, the control plane of existing Xcast+ should be extended. In this document, a new control plane for few- to-few communication for Xcast+ is specified. In order to acheive this, the concept of logical core (LC) is newly introduced.</t>
