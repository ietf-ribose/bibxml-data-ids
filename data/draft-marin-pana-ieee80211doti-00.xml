      <t>PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access) is a link-layer agnostic transport for Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) to enable network access authentication between clients and access networks. PANA framework defines two types of security associations which can be bootstrapped as a consequence of PANA execution: IP layer security is established with IPsec by using IKE and link-layer security with WPA/IEEE 802.11i in PSK mode. This document is focused on how PANA can bootstrap link layer security through IEEE 802.11i and exposes issues which can be raised as a consequence of this interaction.</t>
