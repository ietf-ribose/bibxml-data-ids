      <t>PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access) is alink-layer agnostic transport for Extensible Authentication Protocol(EAP) to enable network access authentication between clients andaccess networks.PANA framework defines two types of security associations which canbe bootstrapped as a consequence of PANA execution: IP layer securityis established with IPsec by using IKE and link-layer security withWPA/IEEE 802.11i in PSK mode.This document is focused on how PANA can bootstrap link layersecurity through IEEE 802.11i and exposes issues which can be raisedas a consequence of this interaction.</t>
