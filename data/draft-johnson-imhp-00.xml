    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the Internet Mobile Host Protocol (IMHP), which allows transparent routing of IP packets to mobile hosts in the Internet, while using only the mobile host's 'home' IP address. No changes are required in stationary hosts that communicate with mobile hosts, and no changes are required in mobile hosts above the IP level. IMHP quickly converges to optimal routing following the movement of a mobile host, while maintaining the 'weak security' model of today's Internet. The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representing the Mobile IP Working Group or the IETF. It is our hope to better explain the issues and to stimulate discussion, in order to assist the Working Group in its efforts to develop a single Group draft protocol specification. This document has not been approved by the Mobile IP Working Group.</t>
