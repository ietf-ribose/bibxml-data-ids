      <t>This document extends BFD mechanism to support detection function forpackets with variable lengths. Through dynamically changing thelength of BFD packets, it can detect both traditional faults such aslink failure or route fault, as well as non-forwarding problem forpackets with a length in a special range, which maybe caused byequipment's internal defects.</t>
