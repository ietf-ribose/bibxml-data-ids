      <t>This document specifies an architecture of DNS service system for mobile ad hoc network which might be connected to the Internet. The resolution of DNS names of mobile nodes within mobile ad hoc network is performed by multicast DNS and that of DNS names of nodes in the Internet is performed through DNS autoconfiguration of recursive DNS server. In the former, each mobile node plays a role of DNS name server for the DNS resource records associated with DNS name of which authority it has. The latter allows mobile node to receive the global Internet service, such as web service, by providing global DNS resolution in mobile ad hoc network connected to the Internet. These two kinds of DNS name resolution are processed automatically without the intervention of users in mobile ad hoc network. Also, this document specifies how to authenticate DNS message as well as how to provide ad hoc users with service discovery based on multicast DNS.</t>
