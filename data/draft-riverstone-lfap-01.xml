      <t>The Lightweight Flow Accounting Protocol (LFAP) is an operations and management protocol that provides detailed information about IPv4 and Ipv6 packets traversing a network element. The primary function of LFAP is the reliable delivery of large volumes of packet header derived information from a network element, termed Connection Control Entity (CCE) to a Flow Accounting Server (FAS) of current or historical flows for billing, capacity planning security, or traffic engineering purposes.</t>
