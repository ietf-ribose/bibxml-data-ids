      <t>The Conferencing Framework described in RFC 4353 defines the semantics necessary for conducting conference calls with the session initiation protocol. It also introduces a mixer entity responsible for combining all media streams and delivering them to the participants of the call. This document presents the lack of a standardized way for such mixers to deliver information about the audio activity (sound level) of participants in a conference call. The document describes the problem and discusses a few possible ways of transporting such information.</t>
