      <t>This document describes how to efficiently implement certain mechanisms of unidirectional operation in ROHC-TCP (robust header compression scheme for TCP/IP), RFC XXX, which can significantly improve the compression efficiency compared to using simple control scheme. All the operational modes and state machines mentioned in this document are the same as the ones described in [ROHC-TCP].</t>
