      <t>The Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) concept introduced in [IPO-Frame] is considered as one of the most important criteria concerning the constrained-based path computation of optical channel routes. By applying the SRLG constraint criteria to the constrained-based path computation, one can select a route taking into account resource and logical structure disjointness that implies a lower probability of simultaneous lightpath failure.</t>
