      <t>The Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) concept introduced in [IPO-Frame]is considered as one of the most important criteria concerning theconstrained-based path computation of optical channel routes. Byapplying the SRLG constraint criteria to the constrained-based pathcomputation, one can select a route taking into account resource andlogical structure disjointness that implies a lower probability ofsimultaneous lightpath failure.</t>
