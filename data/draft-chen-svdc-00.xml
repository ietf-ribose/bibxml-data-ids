    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes SVDC, a highly-scalable and low-overhead virtualization architecture designed for large layer-2 data center networks. By leveraging the emerging software defined network framework, SVDC decouples the global identifier of a virtual network from the identifier carried in the packet header. Hence, SVDC can scale to a large scale of virtual networks with a very short tag in the packet header, which is never achieved by previous network virtualization solutions. SVDC enhances MAC-in-MAC encapsulation in a way that packets with overlapped MAC addresses are correctly forwarded even without in-packet global identifiers to differentiate the virtual networks they belong to. Besides, scalable and efficient layer-2 multicast and broadcast within virtual networks are also supported in SVDC. This document also introduces a basic framework to illustrate SVDC deployment.</t>
