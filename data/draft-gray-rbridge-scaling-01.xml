      <t>RBridges are link layer (L2) devices that use routing protocols as a control plane. They combine several of the benefits of the link layer with network layer routing benefits. RBridges may use existing link state routing (without requiring configuration) to improve RBridge to RBridge aggregate throughput. RBridges also Gray Expires May, 2008 [page 1] Internet-Draft Scaling RBridge DeploymentsNovember 2007 provide support for IP multicast and IP address resolution optimizations. They are intended to be applicable to similar L2 network sizes as conventional bridges and are intended to be backward compatible with those bridges as both ingress/egress and transit. They also support VLANs (although this generally requires configuration) and otherwise attempt to retain as much 'plug and play' as is already available in existing bridges. There has been a lot of discussion within the TRILL working group about the potential for scaling issues when using IS-IS in combination with (possibly as many as 4K) VLANs. This document is intended to provide information on potential scaling issues and the possible solutions that may be applied in deploying RBridges.
