      <t>RFC 2003 specifies a method by which an IP datagram may beencapsulated (carried as payload) within an IP datagram. This is ameans to alter the normal IP routing for datagrams, by deliveringthem to an intermediate destination that would otherwise not beselected by the (network part of the) IP Destination Address field inthe original IP header.This draft allows to extend this encapsulation mechanism also forprivate IP addresses.</t>
