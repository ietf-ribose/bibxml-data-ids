      <t>RFC 2003 specifies a method by which an IP datagram may be encapsulated (carried as payload) within an IP datagram. This is a means to alter the normal IP routing for datagrams, by delivering them to an intermediate destination that would otherwise not be selected by the (network part of the) IP Destination Address field in the original IP header. This draft allows to extend this encapsulation mechanism also for private IP addresses.</t>
