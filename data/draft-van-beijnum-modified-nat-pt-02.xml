      <t>A smooth transition from IPv4 to IPv6 requires that either all hostsare upgraded to dual stack before the first hosts can become IPv6-only, or that there be some mechanism for IPv6-only hosts to talk toIPv4-only hosts. Expecting the former within a reasonable timeframeisn't realistic, based on current adoption of dual stack combinedwith the latest projections for the IPv4 depletion that point to adate early in the next decade. And the IETF has recently deprecatedthe main mechanism that allows the latter: NAT-PT.This document proposes modifications to NAT-PT that address thereasons why the mechanism was deprecated. This should allow futuredeployment of the modified NAT-PT as an IPv4-to-IPv6 transitionmechanism, giving operators the option of running their networkslargely IPv6-only.</t>
