    <abstract>
      <t>The purpose of this document is to provide a mapping of QoS policy information to a form that can be implemented in a directory that uses (L)DAP as its access protocol. Its derivation is as follows. The structure of generic policy information is defined in the Policy Core Information Model ([PCIM]). The mapping of this information to a form that can be implemented in a directory is defined in the Policy Core Schema ([PFSCHEMA]). The [PCIM] is extended to represent specific information needed to represent QoS policies with the QoS Information Model ([QOSIM]). This draft, then, maps the data defined in the [QOSIM] to a form that can be implemented in a directory. Specifically, this draft refines the concept of generic policy rules, conditions and actions to cover extensions necessary for representing policies to control the configuration and management of RSVP and Differentiated Services. This document also discusses LDAP related issues regarding the implementation of such a schema.</t>
