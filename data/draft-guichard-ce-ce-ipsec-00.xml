      <t>This document describes a reference architecture that may be used to tightly integrate CE-CE [IPSec] encryption with the any-to-any connectivity model of [RFC2547]. Using this mechanism, a Service Provider is able to provide an IP VPN service with data encryption between customer edge routers, but without the need of direct routing protocol exchange, or IP-based tunnels such as provided by [GRE].</t>
