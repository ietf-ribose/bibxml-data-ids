      <t>This document defines a YANG data model corresponding to the information model for Network Security Functions (NSF) facing interface in Interface to Network Security Functions (I2NSF). It describes a data model for the features provided by generic security functions. This data model provides generic components whose vendors is well understood, so that the generic component can be used even if it has some vendor specific functions. These generic functions represent a point of interoperability, and can be provided by any product that offers the required Capabilities. Also, if vendors need additional features for its network security function, they can add the features by extending the YANG data model.</t>
