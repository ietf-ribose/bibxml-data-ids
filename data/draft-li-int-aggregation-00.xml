      <t>Routing and addressing are inexorably tied, and the scalability of the routing system is wholly dependent on the abstraction and allocation of the address space. The addressing architecture for the Internet was set forth in [RFC1518], [RFC4632], and [RFC4291]. These describe how address aggregation can be performed at the ISP and local level. Address allocation and assignment procedures by the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) have created large address blocks. This creates an opportunity for further aggregation above the ISP level without any change to existing allocations. This document discusses issues regarding address aggregation above the ISP level, for continents or regions, thereby providing additional address space aggregation and efficiency in the routing system. Small changes to address allocation policies can help to ensure futher aggregations and improvements in routing efficiency. Some of these concepts were discussed as part of the Routing and Addressing meetings [RFC1380] and extended further here. This document is not advocating geographical assignment below the continental level. That has been thoroughly discussed previously.</t>
