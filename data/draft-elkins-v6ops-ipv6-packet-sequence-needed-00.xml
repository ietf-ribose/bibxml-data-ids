      <t>For a number of Enterprise Data Center Operators (EDCO) both real- time and after the fact problem resolution is critical. Two metrics are critical for timely end-to-end problem resolution, without impacting an operational production network. They are: packet sequence number and packet timestamp. Packet sequence number is required for diagnostics. Packet timestamp is required to calculate end-to-end response time. Current methods are inadequate for these purposes because they assume unreasonable access to intermediate devices, are cost prohibitive, require infeasible changes to a running production network, or do not provide timely data. This document provides the background and rationale for the packet sequence number which is a part of the IPv6 Performance and Diagnostic Metrics Destination Option (PDM).</t>
