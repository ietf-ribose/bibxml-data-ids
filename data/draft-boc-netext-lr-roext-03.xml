      <t>The communication path between two Hosts within a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain is artificially long - it involves the LMA, even if straight paths exist (under same MAG, or MAG-to-MAG). Localized Routing PMIPv6-LR concepts developped by NETEXT WG make use of LRI/LRA messages to achieve optimized MAG-to-MAG straight paths. This may prove inconvenient for the network operator, in that it may loose ability to control traffic (LMA control point is skipped). In this draft we present a middle-ground solution. It employs new Intermediary Anchors (IAs) in the paths between MAGs and offers points of control of traffic useful for QoS and lawful interception.</t>
