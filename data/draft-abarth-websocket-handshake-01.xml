      <t>The WebSocket protocol enables two-way communication between a useragent running untrusted code running in a controlled environment to aremote host that has opted-in to communications from that code. Thesecurity model used for this is the Origin-based security modelcommonly used by Web browsers. The protocol consists of an initialhandshake followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP. Thegoal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-basedapplications that need two-way communication with servers that doesnot rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.g. usingXMLHttpRequest or &lt;iframe&gt;s and long polling).Please send feedback to the hybi@ietf.org mailing list.</t>
