      <t>As stated in the MEXT charter, the working group will "work on operational considerations on setting up Mobile IPv6 networks so that traffic is distributed in an optimal way". This topic, referred to as Distributed Mobility Management (DMM), has motivated the submission of multiple problem statement and solution drafts. This document aims at summarizing the current status of the DMM effort, mainly focusing on Mobile IPv6-based solutions, in order to initiate more discussions within the working group.</t>
