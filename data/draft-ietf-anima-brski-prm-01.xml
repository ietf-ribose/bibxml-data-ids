    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines enhancements to bootstrapping a remote secure key infrastructure (BRSKI, [RFC8995]) to facilitate bootstrapping in domains featuring no or only timely limited connectivity between a pledge and the domain registrar. It specifically targets situations, in which the interaction model changes from a pledge-initiator-mode, as used in BRSKI, to a pledge-responder-mode as described in this document. To support both, BRSKI-PRM introduces a new registrar- agent component, which facilitates the communication between pledge and registrar during the bootstrapping phase. For the establishment of a trust relation between pledge and domain registrar, BRSKI-PRM relies on the exchange of authenticated self-contained objects (signature-wrapped objects). The defined approach is agnostic regarding the utilized enrollment protocol, deployed by the domain registrar to communicate with the Domain CA.</t>
