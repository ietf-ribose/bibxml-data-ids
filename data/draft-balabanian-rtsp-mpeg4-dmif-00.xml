      <t>This draft technical proposal describes how MPEG DMIF (DeliveryMultimedia Integration Framework) can be used with RTSP for settingMPEG-4 service sessions and subsequently detaching the service. DMIFcreates an instance of DMIF RTSP augmented with QoS appropriate foreach MPEG-4 stream and also makes use of the FlexMux to carry multiplestreams on a single UDP or TCP IP flow. The stream control play/pauseetc. using RTSP is executed directly by the MPEG-4 Systems Sync Layer. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group'smailing list at confctrl@isi.edu and/or the authors.</t>
