    <abstract>
      <t>SLA is a new IKEv2 exchange that reuses most of the features of the IKEv2 Initial (Phase 1) exchange but allows for legacy authentication that is not susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. It has a flexible number of messages based on the type of authentication being used, and is extensible for new authentication mechanisms. SLA will work with remote access configuration in the same way as IKEv2's Initial exchange.</t>
