      <t>This document specifies a way to create a stateful session withHypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests and responses. Itdescribes three HTTP headers, Cookie, Cookie2, and Set-Cookie2, whichcarry state information between participating origin servers and useragents. The method described here differs from both Netscape'sCookie proposal [Netscape], and [RFC2965], but it can, provided somerequirements are met, interoperate with HTTP/1.1 user agents that useNetscape's method. (See the HISTORICAL section.)This document defines new rules for how cookies can be shared betweenservers within a domain. These new rules are intended to addresssecurity and privacy concerns that are difficult to counter forclients implementing Netscape's proposed rules or the rules specifiedby RFC 2965.This document reflects implementation experience with RFC 2965 andobsoletes it.</t>
