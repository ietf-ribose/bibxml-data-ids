      <t>This draft provides a number of extensions to the Hierarchical MIPv4 model in [1] as well as a new Hierarchical MIPv6 model. A number of additions are made to Regional Tunnel Management in terms of Fast Handoffs and the avoidance of triangle routing within the hierarchical domain. A few extensions were also made for MIPv6 and neighbour discovery to allow for the introduction of a hierarchical MIPv6 mobility management model. The proposed hierarchical mobility management for MIPv6 will improve the performance of MIPv6 in terms of handoff speed and is well-suited to implement access control and handoffs between different access technologies.</t>
