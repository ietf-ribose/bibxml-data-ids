      <t>As per industry trends, Access Networks have been migrating fromtraditional ATM based networks to Ethernet networks. In Ethernetbased access networks, Access Concentrators are typically configuredto act as traditional bridge. These Access Concentrators also act asrelay agents and relay DHCP messages between hosts and DHCP servers.It also maintains and updates lease/location information whilerelaying the DHCP messages. Access Concentrators may use the lease/location information for anti-spoofing, data forwarding etc. Thislease/location information is lost if an Access Concentrator getsrebooted. RFC 4388 [5] has defined a new message type DHCPLEASEQUERYto address similar limitation in Routed Access Networks.This document initially gives an overview of the functioning of theAccess Concentrator acting as a relay agent in a Layer 2 aggregationnetwork. The limitation[as mentioned above] in a typical switched/bridged[layer 2] is then discussed followed by the proposal to extendthe DHCPLEASEQUERY message to address this limitation.</t>
