      <t>This document specifies requirements for implementation of Internet Media Guide (IMG) over Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) because there are still different concepts about applications and technical implementation of IMG. Triple Play Services (TPS) for IPTV need more efficient and integrated IMG than existent IMG for ordinary TV. Such variations raise not only the question of compatibility between different vendors of IMG systems, but bring the confusion at consumer side: which one system is most suitable to viewers and what are the criteria for suitability of IPTV IMG system for viewers. These requirements are designed to guide choice and development of IMG feature.</t>
