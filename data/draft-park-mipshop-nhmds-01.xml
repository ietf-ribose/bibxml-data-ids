      <t>This memo introduces an alternative dynamic MAP (Mobility Anchor Point) discovery and selection procedure for HMIPv6 (Hierarchical Mobile IPv6). A new dynamic MAP discovery method is defined in order to change the size of MAP domain. Subsequent MAP selection algorithm enables to locate MAP on the closest and highest level of hierarchical structure of routers. Addressed method is beneficial not only for the performance of localized mobility management but also for the location privacy. Also it gives flexible domain designing capability to the operators.</t>
