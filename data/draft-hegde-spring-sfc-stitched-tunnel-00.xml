      <t>The term "service function chaining" is used to describe the definition and instantiation of an ordered list of instances of such service functions, and the subsequent "steering" of traffic flows through those service functions.This document describes transport mechanisms that use stitched tunnels to achieve end-to-end service chaining. This document specifies two different types of transport encodings, one based on SR-MPLS and another based on IP tunnels.</t>
