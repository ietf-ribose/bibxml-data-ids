      <t>An application server can voluntarily identify itself to a push service using the described technique. This identification information can be used by the push service to attribute requests that are made by the same application server to a single entity, and reduce the need for endpoint secrecy by being able to associate subscriptions with an application server. An application server is further able include additional information the operator of a push service can use to contact the operator of the application server.</t>
