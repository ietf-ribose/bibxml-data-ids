      <t>This document proposes a method that enables domain names to be used in both local and English scripts, as a directory-search solution at an upper layer above the DNS. The method first converts virtual domain names typed in local scripts into the corresponding domain names in English scripts that comply with the DNS, using the knowledge of transliteration between local and English scripts. Then, the method searches for and displays domain names in English scripts that are active on the Internet so that the user can choose any of them. The conversion takes place automatically and transparently in the user's applications before DNS queries are sent, and so, the method does not make any change to the DNS nor require separate name servers.</t>
