    <abstract>
      <t>IS-IS is commonly used as an underlay routing protocol for MSDC (Massively Scalable Data Center) networks. For a given IS-IS router within the CLOS topology, it would receive multiple copies of exactly the same LSP from multiple IS-IS neighbors. In addition, two IS-IS neighbors may send each other the same LSP simultaneously. The unnecessary link-state information flooding wastes the precious process resource of IS-IS routers greatly due to the fact that there are too many IS-IS neighbors for each IS-IS router within the CLOS topology. This document proposes some extensions to IS-IS so as to reduce the IS-IS flooding within MSDC networks greatly. The reduction of the IS-IS flooding is much beneficial to improve the scalability of MSDC networks.</t>
