      <t>This document describes a solution to the Internet address depletion problem through use of a clever IPv4 options mechanism as a solution. This IPv4 protocol extension is called enhanced IP (EnIP). Because it is IPv4, it maximizes backward compatibility while increasing address space by a factor of 17.9 million. Unlike other similar proposals, care was taken to avoid costly changes and requirements to the core network and border routers, with the exception that options be passed in that equipment as described below. Because it is backward compatible, current IPv4 software, network equipment, firewalls, intrusion detection/protection, and layer 5 firewalls can be maintained until IPv6 system information security reaches acceptable maturity and availability.</t>
