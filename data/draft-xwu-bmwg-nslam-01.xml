      <t>While the networking technologies have evolved over the years, the layered approach has been dominant in many network solutions. Each layer may have multiple interchangeable, competing alternatives that deliver a similar set of functionality. In order to provide an objective benchmarking data among various implementations, the need arises for a common abstract model for each network service layer, with a set of required and optional specifications in respective layers. Many overlay and or underlay solutions can be described using these models.</t>
