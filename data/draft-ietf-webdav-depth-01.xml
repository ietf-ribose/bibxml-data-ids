      <t>The WebDAV protocol specification [Goland et al., 1997] defines the DELETE, COPY and MOVE methods. However these methods have a scope of a single source resource. It is common for principals to wish to perform a DELETE, COPY or MOVE on a collection and all its internal members. This specification defines the DELETE-TREE, COPY-TREE and MOVE-TREE methods that perform the equivalent of DELETE, COPY and MOVE across a collection and all its progeny.</t>
