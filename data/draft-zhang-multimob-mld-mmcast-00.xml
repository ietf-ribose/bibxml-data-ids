      <t>Mobile multicast is a research hotspot. Some mobile multicast schemes was proposed, but most of them depend on the traditional group membership management protocol and concern on the reconstruction of multicast delivery tree by various algorithms, and they little consider the mobile group membership management. So in this memo, we extend the MLD protocol to support the mobile multicast group management. The extension is compatible with the traditional MLD protocols, and it can also be applied to the IGMP protocol to manage the mobile multicast in IPv4.</t>
