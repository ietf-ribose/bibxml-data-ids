    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes a unified method to perceive and advertise the running status of computing resources in a Service Awareness Network by introducing a distributed database. The forwarding operation in a fine-grained service routing policy is correspondingly defined which is completely decoupled from conventional IP routing. In the scheme proposed, the impact of high frequency changes of computing resources is avoided and the compatibility of the network is enhanced.</t>
