      <t>Some users need to choose nodes that meet security requirements to form secure paths and ensure that traffic can defend against dynamic attacks during path forwarding. In this architecture, there are four roles defined: attester, authorizer, controller and secfunction, the interaction of these four roles can achieve the selection of secure paths and security services. the purpose of this architecture is to secure the path, including node static security assessment, dynamic security defense, and path and service validation.</t>
