      <t>In distributed mobility management (DMM) environment, the mobile node (MN) has more than one IP addresses and can use different IP address to communicate with different hosts. When a new correspondent node (CN) initials an IP session with MN, the CN needs to find and select one of the MN's IP addresses to best (e.g. with low delay) for the IP session.. This draft provides two solutions to find and select of MN's IP addresses, one is DDNS[rfc 2136]-based solution, the other is Server Register-based solution.</t>
