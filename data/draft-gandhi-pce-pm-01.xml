      <t>In certain networks, network performance data such as packet loss, delay and delay variation (jitter) is a critical measure for traffic engineering (TE). This data provides operators the characteristics of their networks for performance evaluation that is required to ensure the Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Performance measurement mechanisms can be employed to measure these metrics for TE LSPs in real-time. This document describes PCEP extensions for reporting such performance measurements to an Active Stateful PCE.</t>
