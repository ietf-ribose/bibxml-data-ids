      <t>This document proposes and describes a new IP multicast routing protocol, called 'Hierarchical Level-based IP Multicast' (HLIM). It is designed for a hierarchical IP network and leverages the hierarchical structure to provide efficient IP multicasting. It is originally designed for tactical networks in battlefields but some of its functions could be applied to commercial networks as well.</t>
