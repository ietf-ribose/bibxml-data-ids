    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides an informational discussion of the conceptual relationship between remote attestation, as defined in RFC 9334 (RATS Architecture), and behavioral evidence recording mechanisms. It observes that these two verification capabilities address fundamentally different questions - attestation addresses "Is this system in a trustworthy state?" while behavioral evidence addresses "What did the system actually do?" - and discusses how they could conceptually complement each other in accountability frameworks. This document is purely descriptive: it does not propose any modifications to RATS architecture, define new mechanisms or protocols, or establish normative requirements. It explicitly does not define any cryptographic binding between attestation and behavioral evidence.</t>
