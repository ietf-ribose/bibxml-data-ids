      <t>This document specifies a Diameter application that allows a Diameterserver to authenticate, authorize, and collect accounting informationfor Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) services rendered to a clientnode. This application, combined with the base Diameter protocol andappropriate SIP extensions, allows SIP User Agents (UAs) to obtainservices from SIP servers that are connected to a Diameterinfrastructure. When combined with the Inter-Domain capability ofthe base protocol, service may even be obtained from SIP servers thatbelong to foreign domains, as would be encountered by roaming mobilenodes.Note that the specification defined here may be used independently ofthe authentication technique used for authenticating a node's linklayer or network-layer access. In particular, we do not require thatthe client node was authenticated for access with the use of eitherthe Mobile IP [4] or NASREQ [3] Diameter application.</t>
