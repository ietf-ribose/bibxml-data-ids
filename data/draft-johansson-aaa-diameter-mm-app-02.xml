      <t>This document specifies a Diameter application that allows a Diameter server to authenticate, authorize, and collect accounting information for Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) services rendered to a client node. This application, combined with the base Diameter protocol and appropriate SIP extensions, allows SIP User Agents (UAs) to obtain services from SIP servers that are connected to a Diameter infrastructure. When combined with the Inter-Domain capability of the base protocol, service may even be obtained from SIP servers that belong to foreign domains, as would be encountered by roaming mobile nodes. Note that the specification defined here may be used independently of the authentication technique used for authenticating a node's link layer or network-layer access. In particular, we do not require that the client node was authenticated for access with the use of either the Mobile IP [4] or NASREQ [3] Diameter application.</t>
