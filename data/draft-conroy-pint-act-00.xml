      <t>This Internet Draft is one of a pair written at the request of one of the SPIRITS Working Group co-chairs in order to elicit discussion on what extended functionality SPIRITS may be used to provide; the PINT work has similar requirements for a definition of the building blocks that might be used in future services (and so need to be supported by the protocol). This note provides the 'mirror image' of the associated SPIRITS draft, listing functional building blocks that may be executed in response to future PINT protocol requests.</t>
