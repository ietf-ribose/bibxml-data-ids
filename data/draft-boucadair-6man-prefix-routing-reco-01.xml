      <t>The length of IP prefixes to be manipulated by forwarding and routing processes is policy-based; no maximum length must be assumed by design. This document sketches a recommendation to be followed by forwarding and routing designs with regards to the prefix length. The aim is to avoid hard-coded routing and forwarding designs that exclude some IP prefix lengths.</t>
