    <abstract>
      <t>This document serves as a primer for technical professionals involved in the processing (which includes collecting, using, disclosure, and erasure) of personal data, including not only basic identifiers like name, age, and address, but also sensitive data contained in communications, including biometrics obtained from audio and video recordings. It outlines key concepts in data privacy and communications privacy, addressing the ethical and legal considerations surrounding the collection, processing, sharing, access, retention, and disclosure of individuals’ data. The document covers fundamental privacy principles, defines important roles in data processing, and explains individuals’ rights regarding their personal information. It also discusses the scope of protected personal information, including sensitive data categories, and explores techniques like data aggregation and anonymization. While referencing existing IETF work on privacy in Internet communications, this draft extends beyond to address individuals' data privacy in relation to organizations handling such data. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of privacy considerations, aligning with fair information practices and current regulatory frameworks, to guide professionals in implementing privacy-respecting data management practices.</t>
