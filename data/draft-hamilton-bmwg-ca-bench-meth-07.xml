      <t>The purpose of this document is to define a set of test scenarios which may be used to create a series of statistics that will help to better understand the performance of network devices that operate at nework layers above IP. More specifically, these scenarios are designed to most accurately predict performance of these devices when subjected to dynamic traffic patterns. This document will operate within the constraints of the Benchmarking Working Group charter, namely black box characterization in a laboratory environment.</t>
