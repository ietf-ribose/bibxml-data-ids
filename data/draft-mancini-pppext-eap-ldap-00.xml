      <t>This document specifies an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) mechanism for a challenge-based authentication using MD5 in conjunction with the hash algorithm used to store the password within an identity store. This document defines the EAP-LDAP method, which provides one-way authentication and MD5 key generation. As a result, the EAP-LDAP method, when used by it self, is only appropriate for use on networks where physical security can be assumed. These methods SHOULD NOT be used on wireless networks, or over the Internet, unless the EAP conversation is protected. This can be accomplished using technologies such as IPsec or TLS.</t>
