    <abstract>
      <t>Many applications in todayâ€™s networks rely on reliable and timely flooding of link-state information, such as, but not limited to Traffic Engineered networks. If such link-state information is delayed it can be difficult for those applications to adequately fulfill their intended functionality. This document describes extensions to ISIS supporting distribution of fragment origination time. The origination time can be used to aid troubleshooting and/or by the applications themselves to improve their behavior.</t>
