      <t>This document proposes how PCN marks can be encoded into the IP header. The presented encoding reuses the ECN field of the Voice- Admit DSCP in a single PCN domain. The encoding of unmarked PCN packets indicates whether they are subject to either excess- or exhaustive-marking. This is useful, e.g., when data and probe packets require different marking mechanisms. Status This memo is posted as an Internet-Draft with an intent to eventually be published as an experimental RFC.</t>
