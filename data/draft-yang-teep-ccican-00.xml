      <t>Confidential Computing is the protection of data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based Trusted Execution Environment. Especially in virtualization environments, confidential computing could protect data and applications from access or tampering by hypervisor or other privileged users. In Computing-Aware network, computing resource is an essential element to provide computing services for network users' applications. Introducing confidential computing in Computing-Aware network could mitigate the distrust of computing resource efficiently. This document provides the architecture of confidential computing in Computing-Aware network management plane to provide confidentiality and integrity for applications.</t>
