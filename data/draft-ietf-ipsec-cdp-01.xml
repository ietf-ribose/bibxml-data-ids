      <t>Use of Public key cryptography is becoming widespread on the Internet in such applications as electronic mail and IP Security (IPSEC). Currently, however, a common public key certificate infrastructure does not exist which is interoperable with other systems and ubiquitous. In light of this, we describe a protocol which may be used to exchange or retrieve certificates (essentially signed public keys) with or from another entity. The protocol may be used to request certificates from a directory/name server or from the entity who owns the certificate.</t>
