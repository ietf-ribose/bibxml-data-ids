      <t>The Internet needs support IPv4 and IPv6 packets. Both address families and their attendant protocol suites support multicast of the single-source and any-source varieties. As part of the transition to IPv6, there will be scenarios where a backbone network running one IP address family internally (referred to as internal IP or I-IP) will provide transit services to attached client networks running another IP address family (referred to as external IP or E-IP). It is expected that the I-IP backbone will offer unicast and multicast transit services to the client E-IP networks. Softwires Mesh is a solution for supporting E-IP unicast and multicast across an I-IP backbone. This document describes the mechanisms for supporting Internet-style multicast across a set of E-IP and I-IP networks supporting softwires mesh.</t>
