      <t>This document discusses the One Way Latency (OWL) utilization for enhancing multipath TCP (MPTCP) transmission, which is a potential and beneficial technology in MPTCP Working Group (WG). Several representative usages of OWL, such as retransmission policy, crucial data scheduling, are analyzed. Two kind s of OWL measurement approaches are also provided and compared. We believe that more explorations related with OWL will be important for MPTCP.</t>
