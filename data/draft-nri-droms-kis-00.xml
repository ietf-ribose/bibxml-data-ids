    <title>The Knowbot Information Service</title>

    <abstract>
      <t>Within the metanetwork of networks that exchange electronic mail, there are many directory services that provide partial coverage ofnetwork users; that is, directories with information about some subset of a particular network's user population. Searching the collection of available directories is time-consuming and requires knowledge of each directory's user interface. Although X.500 is currently under study as a basis for an Internet-wide directory service, it is unlikely that a universal user registry will be in place in the near future. The Knowbot Information Service provides a uniform interface to heterogeneous directory services that simplifies the task of locating users in the combined network.</t>
