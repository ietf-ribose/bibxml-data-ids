      <t>This document presents a Pre-IKE Credential (PIC) provisioning protocol.PIC is a method to bootstrap IPsec authentication via an 'AuthenticationServer' (AS) and user authentication mechanisms such as RADIUS. PIChappens before IKE (the Internet Key Exchange protocol). The clientmachine communicates with the AS using a key exchange protocol whereonly the server is authenticated, and the derived keys are used toprotect the user authentication. Once the user is authenticated, theclient machine obtains credentials from the AS that can be later used toauthenticate the client in a standard IKE exchange, with no userintervention. The proposed key exchange is based on ISAKMP (the InternetSecurity Association and Key Management Protocol), similar to asimplified IKE exchange. Arbitrary user authentication is supported viathe use of EAP (the PPP Extensible Authentication Protocol).</t>
