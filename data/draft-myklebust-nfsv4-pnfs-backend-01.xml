    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an extension to the NFSv4.1 draft protocol to allow NFS clients to act as pNFS data servers towards other NFS clients. The intention is to reduce the load on the actual data servers by allowing some trusted clients to share the contents of their data caches with other clients.Keywords The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].</t>
