      <t>This document describes a set of vendor-specific RADIUS attributes designed to support the use of Microsoft's proprietary dialect of PPP CHAP (MS-CHAP) in dial-up networks. MS-CHAP is derived from and (where possible) consistent with PPP CHAP [1]; the differences between PPP CHAP and MS-CHAP are significant enough to warrant the definition of new RADIUS attributes, however.</t>
