      <t>This document describes a set of vendor-specific RADIUS attributesdesigned to support the use of Microsoft's proprietary dialect of PPPCHAP (MS-CHAP) in dial-up networks. MS-CHAP is derived from and (wherepossible) consistent with PPP CHAP [1]; the differences between PPP CHAPand MS-CHAP are significant enough to warrant the definition of newRADIUS attributes, however.</t>
