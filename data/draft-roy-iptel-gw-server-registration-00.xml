      <t>This contribution describes a registration protocol that can be usedbetween gateways (GWs) and severs as well as among servers in intra-ITAD communications environment. The registration protocol is usedby a GW just to inform its transport address and reachable aliasaddresses including telephone numbers through it along with otherinformation (e.g., capacity, cost, traffic, usage, QoS, GoS) to theServer and does not deal with any routes or path attributes.The registration protocol is also used to negotiate capabilitiesbetween the peers.</t>
