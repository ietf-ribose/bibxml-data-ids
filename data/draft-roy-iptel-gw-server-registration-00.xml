      <t>This contribution describes a registration protocol that can be used between gateways (GWs) and severs as well as among servers in intra- ITAD communications environment. The registration protocol is used by a GW just to inform its transport address and reachable alias addresses including telephone numbers through it along with other information (e.g., capacity, cost, traffic, usage, QoS, GoS) to the Server and does not deal with any routes or path attributes. The registration protocol is also used to negotiate capabilities between the peers.</t>
