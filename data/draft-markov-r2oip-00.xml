      <t>A way of sending of telephone interexchange R2 signals over the Internet is presented. Signals are sent as named events. All signals/events are divided in four groups. The label of the group is transferred as payload type, and type of signal inside the group is transferred as an event code. Transfer of signaling packets over the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) utilizes sequencing, numbering and timestamping provided by this protocol. Packets used to transfer the long lasting line signals are intensively transferred only after the change. Labelling of start and the end of signal is performed by marker fields in the header and payload. The reliability of transfer can be increased using the well-known methods of redundant transfer.</t>
