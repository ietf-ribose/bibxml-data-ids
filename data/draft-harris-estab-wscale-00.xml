      <t>The TCP Window Scale option modifies the interpretation of packets in a flow but is transmitted only at the start of the connection. As such there is a problem for observability and fault-finding, since a packet capture by a third party may miss the start of a relevant connection. This document describes the use of TCP options to provide the scale values during a connection.</t>
