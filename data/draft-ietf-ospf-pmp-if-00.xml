      <t>This memo proposes a change to the OSPF Point-to-Point Interface, for the express purpose of describing and routing through a many-branched star topology. The principal near term user of this is the frame relay interface, but the concept is applicable to any multi-point interface, and especially useful in those that otherwise require a large number of small subnets to represent in the existing NBMA scheme.</t>
