      <t>This document defines extensions to Integrated Services (IntServ) allowing multiple traffic specifications and multiple flow specifications to be conveyed in the same Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVPv1) reservation message exchange. This ability helps optimize an agreeable bandwidth through a network between endpoints in a single round trip.
