      <t>There are several reasons for operators to construct multicast treesby another means than multicast routing protocols. This documentlists these reasons and describes 2 ways of building a multicasttraffic-engineered tree: root-initiated tree and leaf-initiated tree.Finally it defines extensions to CR-LDP to support MPLS multicasttraffic engineering.</t>
