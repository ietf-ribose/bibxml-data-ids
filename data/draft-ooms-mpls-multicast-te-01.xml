      <t>There are several reasons for operators to construct multicast trees by another means than multicast routing protocols. This document lists these reasons and describes 2 ways of building a multicast traffic-engineered tree: root-initiated tree and leaf-initiated tree. Finally it defines extensions to CR-LDP to support MPLS multicast traffic engineering.</t>
