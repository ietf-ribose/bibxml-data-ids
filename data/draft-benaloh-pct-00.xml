      <t>This document specifies Version 2 of the Private Communication Technology (PCT) protocol, a security protocol that provides privacy over the Internet. The protocol is intended to prevent eavesdropping on connection-based communications in client/server applications, with at least one of the two always being authenticated, and each having the option of requiring authentication of the other. PCT is somewhat similar to SSL ([1]); however, PCT version 1 corrects or improves on several weaknesses of SSL, and version 2 also adds a number of new features. PCT version 2 is fully compatible with PCT version 1.</t>
