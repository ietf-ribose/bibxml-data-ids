      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO method defines a means fortransporting mid-dialog application layer data between user agents.Its initial use was to support the transport of ISUP mid-callmessages which could not be mapped to any other SIP request method.However, since its initial usage for that purpose, INFO has seenwidespread abuse as a means for introducing non-standard andnon-interoperable extensions to SIP. For this reason, we now believeINFO should be considered harmful, and therefore, deprecated in itscurrent form.</t>
