      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) INFO method defines a means for transporting mid-dialog application layer data between user agents. Its initial use was to support the transport of ISUP mid-call messages which could not be mapped to any other SIP request method. However, since its initial usage for that purpose, INFO has seen widespread abuse as a means for introducing non-standard and non-interoperable extensions to SIP. For this reason, we now believe INFO should be considered harmful, and therefore, deprecated in its current form.</t>
