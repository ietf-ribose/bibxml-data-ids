      <t>Based on the actions they perform, The network model presented in DSTM [1] defines three types of equipments: a DSTM server, DSTM nodes and a Tunnel End Point (TEPs). Within this model, a protocol is required for configuration data exchange among these equipments. This document presents a method to perform these actions based on TSP [2].</t>
