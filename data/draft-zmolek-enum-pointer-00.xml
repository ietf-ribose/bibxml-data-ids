      <t>Current notions of service field tags in ENUM NAPTR records would frame the service exposure problem as a tradeoff between the privacy and heft involved in revealing detailed service information on the one hand or the arbitrary constraint of such information on the other. This draft suggests an alternative approach that keeps NAPTR record size small, places service exposure policy and presence capabilities in the hands of the ENUM registrant where it belongs, and minimizes impact to the ENUM registrar and their respective DNS architecture.</t>
