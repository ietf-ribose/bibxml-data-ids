      <t>The IPv4 Identification (ID) field enables fragmentation andreassembly, and as currently specified is required to be uniquewithin the maximum lifetime on all IP packets. If enforced, thisuniqueness requirement would limit all connections to 6.4 Mbps.Because this is obviously not the case, it is clear that existingsystems violate the current specification. This document updates thespecification of the IP ID field to more closely reflect currentpractice and to more closely match IPv6, so that the field is definedonly when a packet is actually fragmented and that fragmentationoccurs only at originating hosts or their equivalent. Whenfragmentation occurs, this document recommends that the ID field beunique within the reordering context, rather than an arbitrary,unenforced upper bound on packet lifetime.</t>
