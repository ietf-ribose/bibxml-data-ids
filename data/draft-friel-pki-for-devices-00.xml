      <t>This document defines a standard Subject field identifier format for certificates issued to Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This will allow applications to easily and uniquely identify certificates issued to devices as opposed to certificates issue to services or users. The certificates will adhere to standard Web PKI specifications thus ensuring interoperability with existing Certificate Authorities processes and workflows, and standard client and service libraries and applications.</t>
