      <t>This document describes a tranformation method for representing Unicode character codepoints in host name parts in a fashion that is completely compatible with the current Domain Name System. It is proposed as a potential candidate for an ASCII-Compatible Encoding (ACE) for supporting the deployment of an internationalized Domain Name System. The tranformation method, an extension of the UTF-5 encoding proposed by Duerst, provides both for more efficient representation of typical Unicode sequences while preserving simplicity and readability. This transformation method is deployed as part of the current WALID multilingual domain name system implementation, although that status should not necessarily influence the evaluation of its merits as a candidate encoding method.</t>
