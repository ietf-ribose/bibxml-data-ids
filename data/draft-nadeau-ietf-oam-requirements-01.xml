      <t>As transport of diverse traffic types such as voice, framerelay, and ATM over MPLS become more common, the ability to detect,handle and diagnose control and data plane defects becomes critical.Detection and specification of how to handle those defects is notonly important because such defects may not only affect thefundamental operation of an MPLS network, but also because theymay impact SLA commitments for customers of that network.This Internet draft describes requirements for user and dataplane operations and management (OAM) for Multi-ProtocolLabel Switching (MPLS). These requirements have been gatheredfrom network operators who have extensive experience deployingMPLS networks, similarly some of these requirements haveappeared in other documents [Y1710]. This draft specifies OAMrequirements for MPLS, as well as for applications of MPLS suchas pseudowire voice and VPN services. Those interested in specificissues relating to instrumenting MPLS for OAM purposes are directedto [FRAMEWORK]</t>
