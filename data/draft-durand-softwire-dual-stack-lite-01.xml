      <t>The common thinking for more than 10 years has been that thetransition to IPv6 will be based on the dual stack model and thatmost things would be converted this way before we ran out of IPv4.It has not happened. The IANA free pool of IPv4 addresses will bedepleted soon, well before any significant IPv6 deployment will haveoccurred.This document revisits the dual-stack model and introduces the dual-stack lite technology aimed at better aligning the costs and benefitsof deploying IPv6. Dual-stack lite will provide the necessary bridgebetween the two protocols, offering an evolution path of the Internetpost IANA IPv4 depletion.</t>
