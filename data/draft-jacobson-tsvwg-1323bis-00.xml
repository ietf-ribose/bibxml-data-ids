      <t>This memo presents a set of TCP extensions to improve performanceover large bandwidth*delay product paths and to provide reliableoperation over very high-speed paths. It defines new TCP options forscaled windows and timestamps, which are designed to providecompatible interworking with TCP's that do not implement theextensions. The timestamps are used for two distinct mechanisms:RTTM (Round Trip Time Measurement) and PAWS (Protect Against WrappedSequences). Selective acknowledgments are not included in this memo.This memo updates and obsoletes RFC-1323, a Proposed Standard, withsmall clarifications and corrections.</t>
