      <t>This memo describes how to use IPv6 Port Range transition technique in mobile networks for Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 (DSMIPv6). Using the client based DSMIPv6, a mobile node (MN) which is a dual-stack node can be assigned with a shared IPv4 Home Address (HA) together with a port range from the home agent. HA is co-located with Port Range Router (PRR). IPv4-in-IPv6 encapsulation is used to convey IPv4 traffic between the network and the mobile node (MN). HA, acting as PRR receives incoming IPv4 datagrams and determines the routing identifier (IPv6 address) to use to forward the traffic to the appropriate MN among those sharing the same IPv4 address. In the binding mode, HA finds the binding cache entry for this MN and then encapsulates the IPv4 datagram in an IPv6 one and forwards the encapsulated datagram to MN. The stateless mode is also described. Within this memo, Mobile network could be WiMAX network or 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) network.</t>
