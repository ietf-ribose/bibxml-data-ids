      <t>When the Curdle Security Working Group was chartered, a range of object identifiers was donated by Symantec Website Security for use by that working group. This document describes the range of identifiers that were assigned in that donated range, transfers control of that range to IANA, and establishes IANA allocation policies for any future assignments within that range.</t>
