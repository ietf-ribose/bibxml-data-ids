      <t>RFC 5965 defines an extensible, machine-readable format intended for mail operators to report feedback about received email to other parties. This Applicability Statement describes common methods for utilizing this format for reporting both abuse and authentication failure events. Mailbox Providers of any size, mail sending entities, and end users can use these methods as a basis to create procedures that best suit them. Some related optional mechanisms are also discussed.</t>
