      <t>The SCONE protocol provides a scheme for network elements (NEs) to signal the maximally possible throughput limits to end devices, i.e., the flow senders with the assistance from the corresponding flow receivers, for UDP flows transitting thru the NEs. This kind of 'throughput advice' is applied on the per-(UDP)-flow basis. While the advice signaling scheme from NEs inside the traditional public IP network might be challenging, the applicability of the SCONE scheme to the 5G scenario can be more streamlined and practical. This draft discusses from many perspectives how the SCONE can be applied to and realized in the 5G scenario, along with additional advantages that a 5G system might provide to the SCONE.</t>
