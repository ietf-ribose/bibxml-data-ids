      <t>This document defines the use of ROHC header compression mechanisms for the NEMO Basic Support protocol [7]. The idea is to use both NEMO and ROHC as they have been defined. In the NEMO Basic Support protocol, the tunneling between the Mobile Router (MR) and the Home Agent (HA) of the MR is done over different access technologies. Some of these technologies are wireless (e.g. Wireless LAN, 3G or PPP) and have scarce resources by nature, the use of ROHC compression can be useful to reduce the bandwidth consumption.</t>
