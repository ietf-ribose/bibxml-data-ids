    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the Integrated Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (IntOAM) protocol. IntOAM is based on the lightweight capabilities of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection defined in RFC 5880 Bidirectional Forwarding Detection, and the RFC 6374 Packet Loss and Delay Measurement for MPLS Networks to measure performance metrics like packet loss and packet delay. Also, a method to perform lightweight on-demand authentication is defined in this specification.</t>
