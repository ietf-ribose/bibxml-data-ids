      <t>The need for individual right to privacy and the need for law enforcement to be able to effectively investigate crime are sometimes portrayed as being irreconcilably in direct conflict with each other. Both needs are legitimate and ignoring the challenges presented by areas of conflict will not make the problem go away. The document presents a conceptual model that allows for both sets of requirements to be met simultaneously. The reason for this publication is to show that, with some creative thinking, it is possible to identify win-win solutions that simultaneously achieve both privacy and law enforcement goals.</t>
