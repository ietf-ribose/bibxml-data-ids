      <t>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN service to support some application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements. VPN+ requires integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and the characteristics provided by the underlay network. A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual underlay network which consists of a subset of network resources allocated on network nodes and links in a customized topology of the physical network. A VTN could be used as the underlay to support one or a group of VPN+ services. In some network scenarios, each VTN can be associated with a unique logical network topology. This document describes a mechanism to build the SR based VTNs using IS-IS Multi-Topology together with other well-defined IS-IS extensions.</t>
