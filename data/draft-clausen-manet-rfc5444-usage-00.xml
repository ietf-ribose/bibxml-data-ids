      <t>This document updates the generalized MANET packet/message format, specified in RFC5444, by providing prescriptive guidelines for how protocols can use that packet/message format. In particular, these mandatory guidelines prohibit a number of uses of RFC5444 that have been suggested in various proposals, and which would have lead to interoperability problems, to impediment of protocol extension development, and to inability to use generic RFC5444 parsers.</t>
