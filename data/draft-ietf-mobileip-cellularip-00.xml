    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a protocol that allows routing IP datagrams to a mobile host. The protocol is intended to provide local mobility and handoff support. It can interwork with Mobile IP [1] to provide wide area mobility support. Four fundamental design principles of the protocol are: (1) location information is stored in distributed data bases (2) location information referring to a mobile host is created and updated by regular IP datagrams originated by the said mobile host (3) location information is stored as soft state (4) location management for idle mobile hosts is separated from location management of hosts that are actively transmitting or receiving data.</t>
