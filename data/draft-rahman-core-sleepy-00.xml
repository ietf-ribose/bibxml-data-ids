      <t>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained devices. These devices typically have some combination of limited battery power, small memory footprint and low throughput links. It is expected that in CoAP networks there will be a certain portion of devices that are "sleepy" and which may occasionally go into a sleep mode (i.e. go into a low power state to conserve power) and temporarily suspend CoAP protocol communication. This document proposes a minimal and efficient mechanism building on the Resource Directory concept to enhance sleepy node support in CoAP networks.</t>
