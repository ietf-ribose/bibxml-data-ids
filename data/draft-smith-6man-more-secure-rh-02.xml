      <t>The original IPv6 Type 0 Routing Header has been deprecated due to the security risk of a packet forwarding loop being formed, by specifying a large sequence of alternating IPv6 node addresses to visit. This memo proposes a method to prevent these forwarding loops forming, allowing the IPv6 Type 0 Routing Header to be more securely and more safely used. The method may also be applicable to other unicast source routing scenarios.</t>
