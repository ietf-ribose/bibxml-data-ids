      <t>This document introduces the concept of Virtual Customer Premises Equipment (VCPE). Such concept was first proposed in Broadband Forum (BBF) as Network Enhanced Residential Gateway (NERG). The concept is further expanded as not only referring to virtual CPE of residential network, but all the virtual network and service functions shifted from the customer side to the operator side. Deployment of VCPE in some typical DMM (Distributed Mobility Management) scenarios brings specific requirements and even protocol extension in DMM. In this document, we will first explain the motivation and advantages of VCPE. A usecases of VCPE in the community Wi-Fi deployment is further discussed so as to explain the deployment of VCPE in a DMM scenario. Three models of field deployment of VCPE are discussed afterwards to indicate the possible CP/DP decomposition requirement and protocol extension.</t>
