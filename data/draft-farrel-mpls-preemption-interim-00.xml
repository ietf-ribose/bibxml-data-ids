      <t>This document is an interim report into pre-emption in MPLS systems. At the 58th IETF, the MPLS Working Group determined that there are several interpretations of how pre-emption should be achieved within MPLS systems. This document is the result of the initial enquiries to vendors and other implementors into the question of how and why they offer pre-emption funtion in their MPLS inplementations. This document is intended to be a short-lived document and only exists to document the current findings. It will be superceded or retired.</t>
