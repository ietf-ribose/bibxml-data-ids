      <t>One use of a directory service is the retrieval of information,such as email address and spoken name, to support voice messaging.This document defines the directory schema required for anX.500/LDAP-based directory service for use by applicationssupporting Voice Profile for Internet Mail [VPIM2]. The directoryservice is intended to assist the exchange of voice messagesbetween voice messaging systems. Interaction with desktopapplications is outside the scope of this draft.Some schema elements defined herein may be of more general use thanjust for voice messaging. They are included here because they arenot defined elsewhere. It is anticipated that the next version ofthis schema will only reference such definitions if they getdefined in more appropriate areas.</t>
