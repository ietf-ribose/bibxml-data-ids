      <t>One use of a directory service is the retrieval of information, such as email address and spoken name, to support voice messaging. This document defines the directory schema required for an X.500/LDAP-based directory service for use by applications supporting Voice Profile for Internet Mail [VPIM2]. The directory service is intended to assist the exchange of voice messages between voice messaging systems. Interaction with desktop applications is outside the scope of this draft. Some schema elements defined herein may be of more general use than just for voice messaging. They are included here because they are not defined elsewhere. It is anticipated that the next version of this schema will only reference such definitions if they get defined in more appropriate areas.</t>
