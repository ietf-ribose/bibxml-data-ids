      <t>This document specifies the process that Certificate Authorities (CAs) and Relying Parties (RP) participating in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) will need to follow to transition to a new (and probably cryptographically stronger) algorithm set. The process is expected to be completed in a time scale of months or years. Consequently, no emergency transition is specified.</t>
