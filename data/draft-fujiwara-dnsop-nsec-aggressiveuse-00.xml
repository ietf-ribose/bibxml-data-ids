    <abstract>
      <t>DNS highly depends on cache, however, cache usage of non-existence information was limited to exact matching. This draft proposes the aggressive use of NSEC/NSEC3 resource record, which is able to express non-existence of range of names authoritatively. With this proposal, shorter latency to many of negative response is expected as well as some level of mitigation of random sub-domain attacks (referred to as "Water Torture" attacks). And more, non-existent TLD queries to Root DNS servers will decrease.</t>
