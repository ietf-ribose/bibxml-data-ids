      <t>OSPF is a link-state IP interior routing protocol specified in [1]. Several different extensions to OSPF have been proposed [2,3,5] to support Traffic Engineering [4] and Quality of Service routing [5]. This document acknowledges all of this earlier work and proposes that a single style of protocol encoding be used for all of the parameters involved. This document employs the OSPF Opaque LSA Option [6] and the TVLV mechanism proposed in [3] to encode additional parameters describing information about the state of an OSPF network. This additional information is useful for Traffic Engineering and QoS-based routing.</t>
