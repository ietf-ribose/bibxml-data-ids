      <t>Peer-to-peer (P2P) applications have become widely used on theInternet today and make up a large portion of the traffic in manynetworks. In P2P applications, one technique for reducing the totalamount of P2P traffic is to introduce storage capabilities within thenetwork. Traditional caches (e.g., P2P and Web caches) provide suchstorage, but they are complex (due to explicitly supportingindividual P2P application protocols) and they do not allow users tomanage access to content in the cache. For example, ContentProviders cannot easily control access and resource usage policies tosatisfy their own requirements. This document discusses theintroduction of in-network storage for P2P applications, shows theneed for a standard protocol for accessing this storage, andidentifies the scope of this protocol. The accessing protocol canalso be used by other applications with similar requirements.</t>
