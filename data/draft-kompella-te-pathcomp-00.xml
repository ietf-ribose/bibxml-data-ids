      <t>This draft presents some notes on Constraint-Based Routing. The mainpurpose is to standardize the terminology used, and define thesemantics of the various constructs used in Constraint-Based Routingso that implementations from a wide variety of vendors will have (atleast to the first order) similar results in path selection. Asecondary goal is to define the semantics of optimization, which wedefine as the recalculation of routes that have already been computedand established.</t>
