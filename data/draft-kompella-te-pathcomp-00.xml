      <t>This draft presents some notes on Constraint-Based Routing. The main purpose is to standardize the terminology used, and define the semantics of the various constructs used in Constraint-Based Routing so that implementations from a wide variety of vendors will have (at least to the first order) similar results in path selection. A secondary goal is to define the semantics of optimization, which we define as the recalculation of routes that have already been computed and established.</t>
