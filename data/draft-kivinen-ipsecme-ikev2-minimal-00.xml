      <t>This document describes minimal version of the Internet Key Exchangeversion 2 (IKEv2) protocol. IKEv2 is a component of IPsec used forperforming mutual authentication and establishing and maintainingSecurity Associations (SAs). IKEv2 includes several optionalfeatures, which are not needed in minimal implementations. Thisdocument describes what is required from the minimal implementation,and also describes various optimizations which can be done. Theprotocol described here is compliant with full IKEv2 with exceptionthat this document only describes shared secret authentication (IKEv2requires support for certificate authentication in addition to sharedsecret authentication).This document does not update or modify RFC 5996, but provides morecompact description of the minimal version of the protocol. If thisdocument and RFC 5996 conflicts then RFC 5996 is the authoritativedescription.</t>
