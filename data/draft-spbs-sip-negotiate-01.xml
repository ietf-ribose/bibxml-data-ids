    <abstract>
      <t>There is a need to negotiate a multitude of parameters, settings, and algorithms when setting up sessions using Session Initiated Protocol (SIP). While SIP itself provides mechanisms for negotiation of these parameters on a per-session basis through the use of the INVITE method, it does not provide a ready mechanism for meta-session negotiation. The closest mechanism provided is the REGISTER method, however, this method is directed towards the registrar alone, and cannot be used to conduct negotiation of parameters between any two arbitrary SIP nodes.</t>
