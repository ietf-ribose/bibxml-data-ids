    <abstract>
      <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a functional component capable of selecting the paths through a traffic engineered network. These paths may be supplied in response to requests for computation, or may be unsolicited instructions issued by the PCE to network elements. Both approaches use the PCE Communication Protocol (PCEP) to convey the details of the computed path. Traffic flows may be categorized and described using "Flow Specifications". RFC 5575 defines the Flow Specification and describes how Flow Specification Components are used to describe traffic flows. RFC 5575 also defines how Flow Specifications may be distributed in BGP to allow specific traffic flows to be associated with routes. This document specifies a set of extensions to PCEP to support dissemination of Flow Specifications. This allows a PCE to indicate what traffic should be placed on each path that it is aware of.</t>
