      <t>This draft describes the AppMetaData encoding in the BGP Path Attribute for egress routers to advertise the running status and environment of the directly attached 5G Edge Computing (EC) instances. The AppMetaData can be used by the ingress routers in the 5G Local Data Network to make path selection not only based on the routing distance but also the running environment of the destinations. The goal is to improve latency and performance for 5G EC services. The extension enables an EC server at one specific location to be more preferred than the others with the same IP address to receive data flows from a specific source (UE).</t>
