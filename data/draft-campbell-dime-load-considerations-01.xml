      <t>RFC 7068 describes requirements for Overload Control in Diameter. This includes a requirement to allow Diameter nodes to send "load" information, even when the node is not overloaded. The Diameter Overload Information Conveyance (DOIC) solution describes a mechanism meeting most of the requirements, but does not currently include the ability to send load information. This document explores some architectural considerations for a mechanism to send Diameter load information.</t>
