      <t>When published as an RFC, this document provides guidance on the design of methods to avoid congestion collapse and how an endpoint needs to react to incipient congestion. The IETF provides recommendations and requirements on this topic that is distributed across many documents in the RFC series. This document therefore gathers and consolidates these recommendations. Based on these, and Internet engineering experience, the document provides best current practice for the design of new congestion control methods in Internet protocols. When published, the document will update or replace the Best Current Practice in BCP 41, which currently includes "Congestion Control Principles" provided in RFC2914.</t>
