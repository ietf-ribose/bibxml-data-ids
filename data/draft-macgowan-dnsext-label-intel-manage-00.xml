    <abstract>
      <t>A multidimensional array of domain label analysis and extensions are offered to overcome a number of issues with the DNS and its use to locate resources on the Internet. These goals are accomplished by proposing a naming convention to add labels to domain strings. The result will be a rational relationship to the content that will provide a method for meeting the ever-increasing need to expand the namespace, while providing an efficient search system to access content in a user- friendly manner.</t>
