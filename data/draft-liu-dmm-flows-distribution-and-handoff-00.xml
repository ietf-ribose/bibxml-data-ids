      <t>This document has a normative description of the service flows based on IPv6. It makes the upgrade of management model from the entire node granularity to the single service flow granularity, with the compatibility to the existing mobile IPv6. It shows a distributed, compatible with mobile IPv6 network layer mobility solution, which would take different mobility management strategies according to the Correspondent Node's position, network conditions and service requirements of the different service flows so as to achieve the service flow granularity switching and transmission path control. And the standard will also provide route optimization mechanism between the Mobile Node and the ordinary Correspondent Node that doesn't support mobile IPv6, playing a role in promoting the development of new applications and business based on mobile IPv6.</t>
