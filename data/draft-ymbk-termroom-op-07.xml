      <t>Creating and running the 'terminal room' for an IETF meeting istantamount to building, running, and dismantling a small computercenter. Although this is a well-known area of operations, the uniqueenvironment and its ephemeral nature warrant passing on the lore in amildly organized fashion. It is expected that this document will beupdated regularly. However, it is not clear that this will ever bepublished as an RFC.As the IETF can ill afford failure of this service, it is assumedthat the host and organizers have the experience and resources tobuild such environments, understand power facilities, cabling, WANand LAN building, workstation provisioning, staffing, etc. So thisdocument does not attempt to detail how to build computer facilitiesor carry out prudent project management. Rather it concentrates onthe unique aspects of the IETF 'terminal room'.</t>
