      <t>This memo describes a key exchange and security negotiation protocolwhich is intended to depricate [HC98]. As such it will not change the'bits on the wire' for an implementation which is compiant with[HC98] but will clarify contentious issues with [HC98] and attempt toexplain the protocol in a less haphazard manner. Due to advances incomputer processing some mandatory-to-implement attributes havechanged between this [HC98] and this document. In addition a new andoptional exchange is introduced. Like [HC98] this memo uses [MSST98]for a framework and as a language to express exchanges which arederived from [Kra96] and [Orm98].In places where the requirements between this document and [MSST98]or [Kra96] or [Orm98] conflict, this document will be supreme.</t>
