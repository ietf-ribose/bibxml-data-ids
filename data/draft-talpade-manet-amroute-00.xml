      <t>The Adhoc Multicast Routing Protocol (AMRoute) allows for robust IPMulticast in mobile adhoc networks by exploiting user-multicast trees anddynamic cores. It creates a bidirectional shared-tree for datadistribution using only the group senders and receivers as tree nodes.Unicast tunnels are used as the tree links to connect neighbors on the'user-multicast tree.' Thus, AMRoute does not need to be supported bynetwork nodes that are not interested/capable of multicast, and cost isincurred only by group senders and receivers. AMRoute makes certain nodes'core nodes' to initiate the signaling component of AMRoute, such asdetection of group members and tree setup. Core nodes differ significantlyfrom those in CBT and PIM-SM, since they are not a central point for datadistribution and can move dynamically among member nodes. Since AMRoute isnot dependent on any specific unicast routing protocol, it can operateseamlessly over separate domains with different unicast protocols.</t>
