      <t>This document describes the ASN.1 encoding for an X.509 certificate profiled for use with the ElGamal public key cryptosystem [1]. It is intended to provide guidelines for those developing software that will be used to issue and use ElGamal certificates, and to ensure that ElGamal certificate and key information will be handled consistently throughout the public key infrastructure.</t>
