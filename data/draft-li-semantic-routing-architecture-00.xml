    <abstract>
      <t>This document introduces an Semantic Routing (SR) Architecture for enabling intelligent, semantic-driven communication among AI Agents. Unlike traditional IP-based routing or service mesh approaches, SRA leverages application-layer semantics — including service identity, intent vectors, and trust scores — to guide routing decisions dynamically. The architecture supports intent-driven task collaboration, trust-aware policy enforcement, and adaptive routing for multi-agent environments. SRA enables the network to evolve from a passive transport layer to an intelligent collaboration substrate supporting multi-agent coordination and cognitive networking.</t>
