    <abstract>
      <t>The ability to compute shortest constrained Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains has been identified as a key requirement for P2P and P2MP scenarios. In this context, a domain is a collection of network elements within a common sphere of address management or path computational responsibility such as an IGP area or an Autonomous Systems. This document specifies a standard representation and encoding of a domain sequence, which is defined as an ordered sequence of domains traversed to reach the destination domain. This document also defines new sub-objects to be used to encode domain identifiers.</t>
