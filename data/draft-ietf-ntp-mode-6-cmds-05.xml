      <t>This document describes the structure of the control messages used with the Network Time Protocol. These control messages can be used to monitor and control the Network Time Protocol application running on any IP network attached computer. The information in this document was originally described in Appendix B of RFC 1305. The goal of this document is to provide a historic description of the control messages as described in RFC 1305 and any additional commands implemented in NTP.</t>
