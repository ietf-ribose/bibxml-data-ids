      <t>This memo specifies a data structure representation that is suitable for representing arbitrary, complex data structures. It was devised in 1996/1997 to support SPKI (RFC 2692) certificates with the intent that it be more widely spplicable and has been used elsewhere. There are many implementations in a variety of languages. Uses of this representation herein are referred to as "S-expressions". This memo make precise the encodings of these S-expressions: it gives a "canonical form" for them, describes two "transport" representations, and also describe an "advanced" format for display to people.</t>
