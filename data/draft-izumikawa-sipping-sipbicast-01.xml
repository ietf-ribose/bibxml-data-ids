      <t>A vertical session handoff occurs in heterogeneous networks when a session media is moved between access networks within the same device. During session handoff, bi-casting media streams to both access networks of the session's device may be desirable to insure a seamless session handoff. This document describes the general methods and specifies the signaling and media flows for providing this service using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1].</t>
