    <abstract>
      <t>RFC3552/BCP72 describes an Internet Threat model that has been used in Internet protocol design. More than twenty years have passed since RFC3552 was written and the structure and topology of the Internet have changed dramatically. With those changes comes a question: has the Internet Threat Model changed? Or, is the model described in RFC3552 still mostly accurate? This draft attempts to describe a non-exhaustive list of the most likely updates and changes in the current threat environment. This paper has the goal of suggesting a way forward for describing the contemporary threat model and how it might inform security aspects of protocol design.</t>
