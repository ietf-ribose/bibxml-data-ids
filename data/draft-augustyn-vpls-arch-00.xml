      <t>This document describes the architecture and model for Virtual Private LAN Services (VPLS), a class of L2 Provider Provisioned Virtual Private Networks (PPVPN). This model most closely resembles LAN services that are attractive to many providers. It is intended to facilitate the continuing effort to specify the set of protocols and capabilities necessary for implementation of VPLS.</t>
