      <t>This document introduces an application programming interface (API) to the web-based "Network Looking Glass" software. Its purpose is to provide application programmers uniform access to the Looking Glass service and to analyze standardized response. The API interface is supposed to provide the same level of information as web-based interfaces, but in a computer-readable format.</t>
