      <t>Although HTML was designed within the context of MIME, more than the specification of HTML as defined in RFC 1866 is needed for two electronic mail user agents to be able to interoperate using HTML as a document format. These issues include the naming of objects that are normally referred to by URIs, and the means of aggregating objects that go together. This draft describes a set of guidelines that will allow conforming mail user agents to be able to send, deliver and display these HTML objects. In addition it is hoped that these techniques will also apply to the wider category of URI-enabled objects.</t>
