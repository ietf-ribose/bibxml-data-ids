      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is an application layer control (signaling) protocol for creating, modifying and terminating sessions with one or more participants. In the current PSTN, call signaling messages travel through switches which act as trusted intermediaries. The signaling messages typically include calling party identification information which may be delivered to the called party. The calling party is able to suppress the delivery of such information to the called party in order to maintain privacy.</t>
