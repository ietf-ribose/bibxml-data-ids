      <t>Although JSON has become a popular choice of the web services response that tries to be REST like, the lack of its capability to express the hyperlink and other metadata in a standardized manner has been felt. This document proposes a method to minimally represent such metadata that can be inserted into the existing JSON responses to express such metadata.</t>
