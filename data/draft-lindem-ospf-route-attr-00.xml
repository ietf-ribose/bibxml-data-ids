      <t>There are applications which require additional attributes to be advertised with an OSPF route. The existing OSPF LSA formats do not allow for backward compatible extension to advertise these attributes. This draft proposes an extension to OSPF for advertising additional attributes which will be associated with an OSPF route.</t>
