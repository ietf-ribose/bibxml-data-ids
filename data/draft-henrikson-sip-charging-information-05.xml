      <t>This memo describes a private extension to SIP in the form of P-Charging-Function-Addresses and P-Charging-Vector headers. The former header is used to pass the addresses of entities that provide a charging function. The latter header is used to pass charging correlation information. The affected UAs and proxies associated with a dialog or standalone transaction need to know the identities or addresses of the appropriate charging entities. They also need to pass correlation information so that the records generated and sent to the charging entities may be properly associated for a coordinated billing effort.</t>
