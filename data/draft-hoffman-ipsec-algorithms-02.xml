      <t>The IKEv2 protocol [IKEv2] relies on security algorithms to provide privacy and authentication between the initiator and responder. There are many such algorithms available, and two IKEv2 systems cannot interoperate unless they are using the same algorithms. This document specifies an initial set of algorithms for registration with IANA, and specifies which are mandatory to implement. This document also specifies optional suites of algorithms and attributes that can be used to simplify the administration of IKEv2.</t>
