      <t>The IKEv2 protocol [IKEv2] relies on security algorithms to provideprivacy and authentication between the initiator and responder. Thereare many such algorithms available, and two IKEv2 systems cannotinteroperate unless they are using the same algorithms. This documentspecifies an initial set of algorithms for registration with IANA, andspecifies which are mandatory to implement. This document also specifiesoptional suites of algorithms and attributes that can be used tosimplify the administration of IKEv2.</t>
