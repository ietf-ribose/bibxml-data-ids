      <t>This memo documents a GRE fragmentation strategy that has been implemented by many vendors and deployed in many networks. It was written so that a) implementors will be aware of best common practice and b) those who rely on GRE will understand how implementations work. The scope of this memo is limited to point-to-point GRE tunnels. All other tunnel types are beyond the scope of this memo.</t>
