    <abstract>
      <t>The purpose of the Intrusion Detection Exchange Format is to define data formats and exchange procedures for sharing information of interest with intrusion detection and response systems, and with the management sys- tems that may need to interact with them. This Internet-Draft describes a proposed data model to represent the information exported by the intrusion-detection systems, including the rationale for this model. This information is herein refered to as 'Alert', in accordance with the definition given in the IDWG requirements draft [1]. Examples are given to illustrate the use of the model.</t>
