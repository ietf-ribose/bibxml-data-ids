    <abstract>
      <t>A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual underlay network which consists of a customized network topology and a set of network resource allocated from the physical network. In a network, multiple VTNs can be created to meet different service requirements, and services may be mapped to the same or different VTNs. In networks where BGP Shortest Path First (SPF) is used to distribute the link-state information among network nodes, the information of VTNs needs to be distributed along with the basic network information. This document specifies the BGP SPF mechanisms with necessary extensions to distribute the VTN information and perform VTN-specific path computaton.</t>
