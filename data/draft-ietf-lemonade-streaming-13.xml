It allows such clients, which often have limits in storage space and bandwidth, to play video and audio email content. The document describes a profile for making use of the URLAUTH- authorized IMAP URLs (RFC 5092), the Network Announcement SIP Media Service (RFC 4240), and the Media Server Control Markup Language (RFC 5022).
