      <t>As the development of AI technology matured and AI technology began to be applied in various fields, AI technology is changed from running only on very high-performance servers with small hardware, including microcontrollers, low-performance CPUs and AI chipsets. In this document, we consider how to configure the system in terms of AI inference service to provide AI service in a distributed approach. Also, we describe the points to be considered in the environment where a client connects to a cloud server and an edge device and requests an AI service.</t>
