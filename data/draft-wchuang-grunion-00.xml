      <t>S/MIME provides the means to protect message body content but does not protect the sender and recipient identity nor other headers. We propose a means to do so by proxying the sending and receiving via a trusted SMTP server. This document describes how the proxyies are discovered and the wrapped messages created. This then describes how the proxy forwarding is done.</t>
