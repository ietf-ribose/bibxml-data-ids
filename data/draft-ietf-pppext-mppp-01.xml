      <t>This document describes a new feature for L2TP: it allows for a change of LACs during the lifetime of a PPP session without the latency of re-creating a new PPP session where possible. This feature is specially useful for wireless data services where the foreign wireless service provider (WSP) may be different than the user's home service provider and where a user's mobility may result in a change of LAC during an on-going PPP session. This proposal presents 3 different methods of supporting this feature. The simplest method requires only minor changes to both LACs and LNSs. However, it may give a larger handover latency. The other two methods have shorter handover latency and allow us to extend the L2TP session by an additional hop.</t>
