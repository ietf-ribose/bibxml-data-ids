      <t>This document specifies the Trajectory-based Recognition of Identity Proof (TRIP) protocol, a decentralized mechanism for establishing claims of physical-world presence through cryptographically signed, spatially quantized location attestations called "breadcrumbs." Breadcrumbs are chained into an append-only log, bundled into verifiable epochs, and distilled into a Trajectory Identity Token (TIT) that serves as a persistent pseudonymous identifier. This revision introduces a formal trust-scoring framework grounded in statistical physics. A Criticality Engine evaluates the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of movement trajectories for the 1/f signature characteristic of biological Self-Organized Criticality (SOC). A mobility model based on truncated Levy flights and Markov anchor transition matrices enforces known constraints of human movement. A six-component Hamiltonian energy function detects anomalies in real time by combining spatial, temporal, kinetic, flock-alignment, contextual, and structural analysis of each breadcrumb against the identity's learned behavioral profile. TRIP is designed to be transport-agnostic and operates independently of any particular naming system, blockchain, or application layer.</t>
