      <t>Perhaps the most common use of IPsec is in providing virtual privatenetworking capabilities. One very popular use of VPNs is to providetele-commuter access to the corporate Intranet. Today NATs are widelydeployed in home gateways, as well as in other locations likely to beused by tele-commuters, such as hotels. The result is that IPsec-NATincompatibilities have become a major barrier to deployment of IPsec inone of its principal uses. This draft describes known incompatibilitiesbetween NAT and IPsec, and describes the requirements for addressingthem.</t>
