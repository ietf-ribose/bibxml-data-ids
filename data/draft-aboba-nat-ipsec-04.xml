    <abstract>
      <t>Perhaps the most common use of IPsec is in providing virtual private networking capabilities. One very popular use of VPNs is to provide tele-commuter access to the corporate Intranet. Today NATs are widely deployed in home gateways, as well as in other locations likely to be used by tele-commuters, such as hotels. The result is that IPsec-NAT incompatibilities have become a major barrier to deployment of IPsec in one of its principal uses. This draft describes known incompatibilities between NAT and IPsec, and describes the requirements for addressing them.</t>
