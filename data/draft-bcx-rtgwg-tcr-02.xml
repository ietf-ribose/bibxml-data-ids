      <t>Token Cell Routing is a powerful yet hardware friendly method of constructing data plane packets to meet the needs of new applications. It is based on the use of token cells (special kinds of lightly structured tokens) to provide pointers to procedures pre- positioned in the forwarding layer together with the parameters needed to provide the required processing context. A packet can be composed from multiple token cells as needed to result in new new network processing and forwarding semantics.</t>
