      <t>This document specifies the Ephemeral Compute Attestation (ECA) protocol, which enables ephemeral compute instances to prove their identity without pre-shared operational credentials. ECA uses a three-phase ceremony that cryptographically combines a public Boot Factor (a high-entropy provisioning value), a secret Instance Factor, and a dynamically released Validator Factor to establish attestation evidence. The protocol is transport-agnostic and produces Entity Attestation Tokens (EAT) for consumption by Relying Parties, such as within automated certificate issuance protocols.</t>
