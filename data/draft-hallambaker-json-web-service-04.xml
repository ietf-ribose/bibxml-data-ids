      <t>The JSON Web Binding (JWB) describes a standardized approach to implementing Web Services. Services are advertised using the DNS SRV and HTTP Well Known Service conventions. Messages may be authenticated or authenticated and encrypted at the message layer in addition to any transport and/or network layer security. Service messages are encoded in JSON using Internet time format for Date-Time fields and Base64urlencoding for binary objects. This document specifies Version 1.0 of JWB which uses HTTP/1.1 for transport. Use of the multiple stream capabilities of HTTP version 2 is outside the scope of this document.</t>
