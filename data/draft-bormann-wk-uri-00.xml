      <t>RFC 5785 defines a path prefix, "/.well-known/", that can be used by well-known URIs, specifically for the "http" and "https" URI schemes, which has since been adopted by other URI schemes. The present memo formally updates RFC 7595, which defines the URI schemes regustry, to record the availability of these well-known URIs to the URI schemes registered there.</t>
