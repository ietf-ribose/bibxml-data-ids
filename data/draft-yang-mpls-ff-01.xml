      <t>A fractional-forwarding scheme is a highly compact, flexible scheme for specify routing for both traffic engineering (TE) and fast rerouting. The ability of fractional forwarding can be a key benefit of MPLS over OSPF/IS-IS. Many highly effective TE algorithms are proposed and evaluated based on fractional forwarding. In this document, we propose MPLS-ff, an extension to MPLS to allow efficient implementation of fractional forwarding. We present the required extensions in the MPLS data forwarding plane. We also list the requirements in signaling for MPLS-ff.</t>
