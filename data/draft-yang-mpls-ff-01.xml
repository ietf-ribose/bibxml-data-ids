      <t>A fractional-forwarding scheme is a highly compact, flexible schemefor specify routing for both traffic engineering (TE) and fastrerouting. The ability of fractional forwarding can be a key benefitof MPLS over OSPF/IS-IS. Many highly effective TE algorithms areproposed and evaluated based on fractional forwarding.In this document, we propose MPLS-ff, an extension to MPLS to allowefficient implementation of fractional forwarding. We present therequired extensions in the MPLS data forwarding plane. We also listthe requirements in signaling for MPLS-ff.</t>
