      <t>This draft presents the work on the framework for the ResourceManagement in Diffserv (RMD) designed for edge-to-edge resourcereservation in a Differentiated Services (Diffserv) domain. The RMDextends the Diffserv architecture with new resource reservationconcepts and features. Moreover, this framework enhances the LoadControl protocol described in [WeTu00].The RMD framework defines two architectural concepts:- the Per Hop Reservation (PHR)- the Per Domain Reservation (PDR)The PHR protocol is used within a Diffserv domain on a per-hop basisto augment the Diffserv Per Hop Behavior (PHB) with resourcereservation. It is implemented in all nodes in a Diffserv domain. Onthe other hand, the PDR protocol manages the resource reservation perDiffserv domain, relying on the PHR resource reservation status inall nodes. The PDR is only implemented at the boundary of the domain(at the edge nodes).The RMD framework presented in this draft describes the newreservation concepts and features. Furthermore it describes the:- relationship between the PHR and PHB- interaction between the PDR and PHR- interoperability between the PDR and external resourcereservation schemesThis framework is an open framework in the sense that it provides thebasis for interoperability with other resource reservation schemesand can be applied in different types of networks as long as they areDiffserv domains. It aims at extreme simplicity and low cost ofimplementation along with good scaling properties.</t>
