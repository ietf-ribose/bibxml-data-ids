      <t>Homomorphic encryption is an algorithm that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without first having to decrypt it. This document provides a homomorphic cryptographic protocol that supports addition and multiplication in the ciphertext state. In this document, the proposed protocol can be used to protect user privacy in measurement information collection and statistics by using homomorphic encryption. And let the collector server receive the computation results without having to acknowledge the information plaintext of each individual client.</t>
