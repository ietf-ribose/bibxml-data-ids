      <t>This document identifies requirements for an end-to-end negotiationof the Quality of Service (QoS) aspects of each media component of amulti-media session at the application level, before requesting thetransport layer for bearer setup.It is believed that in the future, QoS will be one of the majordifferentiators in the context of a new generation of multi-mediaservices based on the IP technology. As such, QoS cannot beconsidered anymore as a matter of bearer handling only, but it hasalso to include the application layer. Moreover, QoS has to beconsidered as part of the media component description, andtherefore, to be negotiated or re-negotiated during the sessionlife.</t>
