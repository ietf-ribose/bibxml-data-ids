      <t>This document identifies requirements for an end-to-end negotiation of the Quality of Service (QoS) aspects of each media component of a multi-media session at the application level, before requesting the transport layer for bearer setup. It is believed that in the future, QoS will be one of the major differentiators in the context of a new generation of multi-media services based on the IP technology. As such, QoS cannot be considered anymore as a matter of bearer handling only, but it has also to include the application layer. Moreover, QoS has to be considered as part of the media component description, and therefore, to be negotiated or re-negotiated during the session life.</t>
