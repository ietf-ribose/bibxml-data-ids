      <t>Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS, also known as Transparent LANService) is a useful Service Provider offering. A common scenariowhere this offering is made is in the metro area, where severalMulti-Tenant buildings are connected to an Office, and severalOffices are connected by a metro area network. The Service Providerplaces a simple, low-cost box (MTU) in each building; these MTUs haveuplinks to some box (PE) in one or more Offices. In such a scenario,it is useful to decouple the functions needed to offer VPLS acrossthe MTU and PE; this document proposes one way of accomplishing that.</t>
