      <t>This document describes an algorithm that makes Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) connectivity checks more responsive by reducing delays in dual-stack host ICE connectivity checks when there is a path failure for an address family preferred by the application or by the operating system. As IPv6 is usually preferred over IPv4, the procedures in this document helps avoid user- noticeable delays when the IPv6 path is broken or excessively slow.</t>
