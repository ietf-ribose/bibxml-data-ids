    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an experimental protocol named the Available Session Recovery Protocol (ASRP). The protocol is designed to optimize high-availability network cluster architectures, providing a superior high-availability solution for clusters offering stateful network services such as load balancing and Network Address Translation (NAT [RFC4787] [RFC5508]). ASRP defines the procedures for session backup and recovery, as well as the message formats used during these interactions, enabling efficient and streamlined session state management. In contrast to traditional high-availability techniques that back up session state within the cluster itself, the core innovation of ASRP lies in its distributed backup of state information to the client or server side. This approach offers multiple advantages: it significantly enhances the cluster's elastic scaling capabilities; supports rapid recovery from single-point or even multi-point failures; reduces resource redundancy by eliminating centralized backup nodes; and substantially simplifies the implementation complexity of the cluster. The ASRP protocol provides exceptional elastic scalability for network clusters, facilitating the implementation and deployment of large-scale elastic network clusters.</t>
