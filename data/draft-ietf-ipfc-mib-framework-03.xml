    <abstract>
      <t>This document discusses technical issues and requirements for the management information base (MIB) for Fibre Channel and storage network applications. This document is likely to be expanded to include management of specific Fibre Channel device types in the future. The purpose is to have an overall structure and view of Fibre Channel MIBs for consistency and interoperability. This document does not try to cover the details of each individual MIB. This is an initial draft document, which will evolve and expand over time. It is the intent of this document to produce a coherent description of a framework for various MIB development which was and is being considered by the working group. Selection of specific approaches, making choices regarding engineering tradeoffs, and detailed protocol specification, are outside of the scope of this framework document.</t>
