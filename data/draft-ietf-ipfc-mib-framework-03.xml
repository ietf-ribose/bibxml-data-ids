      <t>This document discusses technical issues and requirements for themanagement information base (MIB) for Fibre Channel and storagenetwork applications. This document is likely to be expanded toinclude management of specific Fibre Channel device types in thefuture. The purpose is to have an overall structure and view ofFibre Channel MIBs for consistency and interoperability. Thisdocument does not try to cover the details of each individual MIB.This is an initial draft document, which will evolve and expandover time. It is the intent of this document to produce a coherentdescription of a framework for various MIB development which wasand is being considered by the working group. Selection ofspecific approaches, making choices regarding engineering tradeoffs,and detailed protocol specification, are outside of the scope ofthis framework document.</t>
