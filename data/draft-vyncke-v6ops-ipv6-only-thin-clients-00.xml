      <t>While IPv6-only (no IPv4 at all) is becoming an objective, there are remaining issues on this road for the wired thin clients. This document enumerates of couple of them; each with a short description, followed by a description of the issue in IPv6-only networks then some solutions. It is expected that this document will grow by collecting other roadblocks and suggestions to remove them.</t>
