      <t>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. An ingress node steers a packet through a controlled set of instructions, called segments, by pre-pending the packet with an SR header. A segment can represent any instruction, topological or service-based. A segment can have a local semantic to an SR node or global within an SR domain. SR allows one to enforce a flow through any topological path and service chain while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node of the SR domain. This document introduces the segment routing in IP Radio Access Network (IP RAN, mobile backhaul network) use case. Additional requirements to support segment routing in the IP RAN scenarios are discussed.</t>
