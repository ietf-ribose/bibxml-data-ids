      <t>The Kerberos protocol does not allow ticket extensions. This make itharder to deploy features like referrals and PKCROSS.Since the Kerberos protocol did not specified extensibility for theTicket structure and the current implementations are aware of thecontents of tickets, the extension protocol cannot simply extend theTicket ASN.1 structure. Instead, the extension data needs to behidden inside the ticket.This protocol defines two methods to add extend the tickets. Thefirst method requires updated clients and is more in line with thefuture development of Kerberos. The second way does not requireupdate client. To take advantage of this protocol the server (KDC orapplication server) need to update a well. The two methods areequivalent and there is a 1-1 mapping between them.</t>
