      <t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie headers. Theseheaders can be used by HTTP servers to store state on HTTP useragents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over themostly stateless HTTP protocol. The cookie protocol has manyhistorical infelicities and should be avoided for new applications ofHTTP.NOTE: If you have suggestions for improving the draft, please sendemail to http-state@ietf.org. Suggestions with test cases areespecially appreciated.</t>
