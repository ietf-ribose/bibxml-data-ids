      <t>This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie headers. These headers can be used by HTTP servers to store state on HTTP user agents, letting the servers maintain a stateful session over the mostly stateless HTTP protocol. The cookie protocol has many historical infelicities and should be avoided for new applications of HTTP. NOTE: If you have suggestions for improving the draft, please send email to http-state@ietf.org. Suggestions with test cases are especially appreciated.</t>
