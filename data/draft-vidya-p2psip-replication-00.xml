      <t>RELOAD [1] provides successor replication of data to protect againstdata loss occurring from churn on the overlay. It specifies storingof two redundant copies of data on the two immediate successors of aparticular node. This provides for basic replication and is highlyessential for stability of the overlay. However, it does not addressthe problem of replication to meet the availability requirements fora particular piece of data or to have the replicas be useful in someinherent load balancing on the overlay. This document specifies amechanism to provide application-agnostic, deterministic replicationon the overlay to meet these needs.</t>
