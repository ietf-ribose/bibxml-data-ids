      <t>[RFC5220] describes the possible problems which an end host may experience, if the end host has multiple prefixes in a single physical link. This document proposes a solution of so-called "try and error" type about these problems originated in "Source Address Selection" which is described in [RFC5220]. A new mechanism to settle almost all of these problems is described in this document, but actually it is not effective in some particular cases. Thus it is necessary for every end user/host to be able to select on/off of this mechanism.</t>
