      <t>[RFC5220] describes the possible problems which an end host mayexperience, if the end host has multiple prefixes in a singlephysical link. This document proposes a solution of so-called "tryand error" type about these problems originated in "Source AddressSelection" which is described in [RFC5220]. A new mechanism tosettle almost all of these problems is described in this document,but actually it is not effective in some particular cases. Thus it isnecessary for every end user/host to be able to select on/off of thismechanism.</t>
