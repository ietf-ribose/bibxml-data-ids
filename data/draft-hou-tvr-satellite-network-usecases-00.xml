    <abstract>
      <t>Time-Variant Routing (TVR) is chartered and proposed to solve the problem of time-based, scheduled changes, including the variations of links, adjacencies, cost, and traffic volumes in some cases. In a satellite network, the network is in continual motion which will cause detrimental consequences on the routing issue. However, each network node in a satellite network follows a predefined orbit around the Earth and represents an appropriate example of time-based scheduled mobility. Therefore, TVR can be implemented to improve the routing and forwarding process in satellite networks. This document mainly focuses on the use cases in this scenario.</t>
