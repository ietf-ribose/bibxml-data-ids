      <t>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) aims to provide enhanced VPN services to support some existing or emerging application's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements. VPN+ requires integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and the characteristics provided by the underlay network. A VTN is a virtual underlay network that is associated with a network topology, and is allocated with a set of dedicated or shared resources from the underlay physical network. A VTN could be used as the underlay for one or a group of VPN+ services. The topological constraints of a VTN can be defined using Flex-Algo, a mechanism to provide distributed constraint-path computation. In some network scenarios, each VTN can be associated with a unique Flex-Algo, and the set of network resources allocated to different VTNs can be instantiated as layer-2 sub-interfaces or member links of the layer-3 interfaces. This document describes the mechanisms to build the Segment Routing (SR) based VTNs using SR Flex-Algo and IGP L2 bundles with minor extensions. This document updates RFC 8668 by defining a new flag in the Parent L3 Neighbor Descriptor in the L2 Bundle Member Attributes TLV.</t>
