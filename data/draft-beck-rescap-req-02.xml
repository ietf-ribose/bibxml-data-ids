      <t>A variety of resource identifiers have been widely deployed on the Internet as a means of identifying various resources, services, and destinations. However, a means of attaching a set of attributes or characteristics to a given resource identifier and subsequently assessing those attributes or characteristics has not been specified and deployed. A particularly important resolution service of this general type is one which, when given a mail address identifying a particular mail recipient, will return a series of attributes describing the capabilities of that recipient. This differs from a directory service in that no searching or other advanced query operations are involved. Two tasks are envisioned. The first task will be to define a general resolution protocol that will translate resource identifiers to a list of attributes. The second task will be to define an administrative model and update protocol that can be used to set up and maintain the information the resolution protocol accesses. This document defines the requirements for these two protocols.</t>
