      <t>A variety of resource identifiers have been widely deployed on theInternet as a means of identifying various resources, services, anddestinations. However, a means of attaching a set of attributes orcharacteristics to a given resource identifier and subsequentlyassessing those attributes or characteristics has not been specifiedand deployed.A particularly important resolution service of this general type isone which, when given a mail address identifying a particular mailrecipient, will return a series of attributes describing thecapabilities of that recipient. This differs from a directoryservice in that no searching or other advanced query operations areinvolved.Two tasks are envisioned. The first task will be to define a generalresolution protocol that will translate resource identifiers to alist of attributes. The second task will be to define anadministrative model and update protocol that can be used to setup and maintain the information the resolution protocol accesses.This document defines the requirements for these two protocols.</t>
