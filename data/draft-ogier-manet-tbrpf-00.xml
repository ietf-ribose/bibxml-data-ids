      <t>Topology Broadcast based on Reverse-Path Forwarding (TBRPF) is alink-state routing protocol designed for use in a mobile ad-hocnetwork (MANET) or an internet. TBRPF provides each node with thestate of each link in the network, but does so much more efficientlythan flooding (e.g., OSPF). TBRPF uses the concept of reverse-pathforwarding to efficiently and reliably broadcast each link-stateupdate along the minimum-hop-path tree rooted at the source of theupdate. The broadcast trees (one tree per source) are updateddynamically using the topology information that is received along thetrees themselves, thus requiring very little additional overhead formaintaining the trees. This document describes TBRPF and discussesdetails for the implementation of TBRPF in IPv4-based MANETs.</t>
