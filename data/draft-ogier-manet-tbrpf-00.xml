      <t>Topology Broadcast based on Reverse-Path Forwarding (TBRPF) is a link-state routing protocol designed for use in a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) or an internet. TBRPF provides each node with the state of each link in the network, but does so much more efficiently than flooding (e.g., OSPF). TBRPF uses the concept of reverse-path forwarding to efficiently and reliably broadcast each link-state update along the minimum-hop-path tree rooted at the source of the update. The broadcast trees (one tree per source) are updated dynamically using the topology information that is received along the trees themselves, thus requiring very little additional overhead for maintaining the trees. This document describes TBRPF and discusses details for the implementation of TBRPF in IPv4-based MANETs.</t>
