      <t>At the 51st IETF meeting in London, there was much disagreement in the MIDCOM working group about the need for topology information in the MIDCOM requirements. It was decided that there should be a 'contest of champions' in which interested parties write drafts describing their solution to the problem. This document presents a proposal for the inclusion of minimal topological information in the MIDCOM protocol by the use of abstract realms.</t>
