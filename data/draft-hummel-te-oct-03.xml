      <t>This draft proposes to engineer traffic such that we can speak of anOrchestrally Conducted Traffic (OCT): Any traffic stream (given byits source and destination nodes and by a priority class) may useseveral differently routed LSPs. Each, traffic stream ingressreports, periodically, the currently measured traffic load (inbitrate) to a common TE Conductor (TEC) who evaluates them as toforecast what traffic load change might occur in the immediate timeahead. Accordingly the TEC computes well synchronized likelihoodvalues by which to take which route/LSP. These values will be suchthat any traffic stream will be served as good as possible, as oftenas possible, while equally ranked traffic streams are treated fair,higher ranked streams are prioritized and the network thruput ismaximized. The TEC sends the likelihood values to the respectiveingress node, who will distribute the received packets of thetraffic stream to the pertaining LSPs accordingly.</t>
