    <abstract>
      <t>The Information Centric Networking (ICN) paradigm, shifts the focus of networking from providing connections between hosts to efficiently providing content to the users. The work on ICN has traditionally been performed looking at "clean-slate" solutions which aims to replace IP with a new paradigm. On the other hand, in this memo we propose an "integration" approach to Information Centric Networking, i.e. we extend the IP protocol using a new IP Option (both for IPv4 and IPv6). The new IP option is used by routers to support networking based on content rather than (or better in addition to) end-point addresses.</t>
