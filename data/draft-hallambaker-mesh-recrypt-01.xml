      <t>Proxy Re-encryption 'recryption' is a form of public key encryption in which decryption requires the use of multiple keys. The Mesh/ Recrypt protocol is an implementation of a recryption scheme that supports use of end-to-end encryption by groups of users whose membership may change over time. The system is implemented using two separate protocols; An administration protocol that allows the creation of recryption groups, adding and removing members and a client protocol that allows an authorized group member request a partial decryption operation.</t>
