    <abstract>
      <t>In TRILL multi-homing scenario, the concept of virtual RBridge in [TRILLPN], was introduced to address the MAC flip-flopping problem at remote RBridges. Based on virtual RBridge mechanism, Coordinated Multicast Trees (CMT) solution in [CMT] was introduced to solve the related RPF issues. In this document, additional problems are described regarding virtual Bridges members' state synchronization in multi-homing scenario, including virtual RBridge membership auto discovery, pseudo-nickname static configuration consistency check, dynamic pseudo-nickname allocation, CMT configuration synchronization,LACP configuration and state synchronization, node/link failure detection, and MAC table synchronization. To address these problems, a communication protocol among members of a virtual RBridge group should be provided. Requirements for this protocol is also discussed.</t>
