      <t>The Media Server Markup Language [RFC5707] is used to control and invoke many different types of services on IP media servers. MSML can be used, for example, to control media server conferencing features such as video layout and audio mixing, create sidebar conferences or personal mixes, and set the properties of media streams. As well, clients can use MSML to define media processing dialogs, which may be used as parts of application interactions with users or conferences. This document describes the use of MSML [RFC5707] language used within the context of Media Control Channel Framework [RFC6230]. The use of MSML [RFC5707] is described here as a standalone package for use within and compliant with the Media Control Channel Framework [RFC6230].</t>
