      <t>This document defines qlog, an extensible high-level schema for a standardized logging format. It allows easy sharing of data, benefitting common debug and analysis methods and tooling. The high- level schema is independent of protocol; separate documents extend qlog for protocol-specific data. The schema is also independent of serialization format, allowing logs to be represented in many ways such as JSON, CSV, or protobuf. Note to Readers Note to RFC editor: Please remove this section before publication. Feedback and discussion are welcome at https://github.com/quicwg/qlog (https://github.com/quicwg/qlog). Readers are advised to refer to the "editor's draft" at that URL for an up-to-date version of this document. Concrete examples of integrations of this schema in various programming languages can be found at https://github.com/quiclog/ qlog/ (https://github.com/quiclog/qlog/).</t>
