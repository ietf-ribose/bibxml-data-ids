      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it defines a basic set of managed objects for SNMP- based management of CableHome compliant WAN Gateway Devices and home routers. This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the SNMP SMIv2 [5][6][7]. The set of objects is consistent with the SNMP framework and existing SNMP standards. This memo is a product of the IPCDN working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at ipcdn@ietf.org and/or the editor.</t>
