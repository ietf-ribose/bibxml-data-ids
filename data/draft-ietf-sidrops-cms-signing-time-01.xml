    <abstract>
      <t>RFC 6488 standardized a template for specifying Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) protected content types for use with the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) called Signed Objects. Since the publication of that document, a new additional protocol for distribution of RPKI repositories was developed: the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP) (RFC 8182) and new insights arose with respect to querying and combining the different distribution mechanisms. This document describes how Publishers and Relying Parties can use the CMS signing-time attribute to facilitate seamless switchovers from RRDP to RSYNC. Additionally, this document updates RFC 6488 by mandating the presence of the CMS signing-time attribute and disallowing the binary-signing-time attribute in Signed Objects.</t>
