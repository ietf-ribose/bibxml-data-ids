      <t>This document defines two Notification Payload (NUM_QUEUES and QUEUE_INFO) for the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2). These payloads add support for negotiating multiple identical Child SAs that can be used to to optimize performance based on the number of queues or CPUs, orcw to create multiple Child SAs for different Quality of Service (QoS) levels. Using multiple identical Child Sa's has the additional benefit that multiple streams have their own Sequence Number, ensuring that CPU's don't have to synchronize their crypto state or disable their replay window detection.</t>
