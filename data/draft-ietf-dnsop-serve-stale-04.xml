      <t>This draft defines a method (serve-stale) for recursive resolvers to use stale DNS data to avoid outages when authoritative nameservers cannot be reached to refresh expired data. It updates the definition of TTL from [RFC1034], [RFC1035], and [RFC2181] to make it clear that data can be kept in the cache beyond the TTL expiry and used for responses when a refreshed answer is not readily available. One of the motivations for serve-stale is to make the DNS more resilient to DoS attacks, and thereby make them less attractive as an attack vector.</t>
