    <abstract>
      <t>By default, The Border Gateway Protocol, BGP only installs the best- path to the IP Routing Table. BGP multi-path is a well known feature that enables installation of multiple paths to the IP Routing Table. This is done to achieve load balancing while forwarding traffic. For a path to be eligible as a multi-path, certain criteria need to be fulfilled. Inter-AS VPNs are commonly deployed to span organizations across Service Provider boundaries. In this draft, we describe an issue relating to multi-path load balancing that can arise in an Option B Inter-AS Deployment. With the help of a representative topology, we illustrate the problem and then present two simple schemes as the solution to the problem. We also note as a matter of independent interest that the same underlying issue is applicable to deployments that employ next-hop-self behavior (implicit or explicit) downstream and the multi-path feature upstream.</t>
