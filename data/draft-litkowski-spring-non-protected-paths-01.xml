      <t>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. A node can steer a packet on a specific path by prepending the packet with an SR header. In the framework of traffic-engineering use cases, a customer may request its service provider to implement some non protected paths. This means that in case of a failure within the network, fast-reroute (or similar) techniques should not be activated for those paths. This document analyzes the different options to implement a non protected path with Segment Routing and in a future release will provide a recommandation on the best option.</t>
