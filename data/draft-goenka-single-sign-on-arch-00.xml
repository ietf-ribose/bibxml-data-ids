      <t>There are several different single sign-on (SSO) solutions offered by various software vendors today. All such solutions require applications to be written to a vendor specific API. In view of a lack of industry wide standard for SSO APIs, application developers find it almost impossible to SSO enable their applications to work with any vendor solution. This document presents alternative SSO implementation architecture that allows applications to be transparently enabled for SSO. Further, it allows different SSO solutions to interoperate with relatively little effort.</t>
