      <t>There are several different single sign-on (SSO) solutions offeredby various software vendors today. All such solutions requireapplications to be written to a vendor specific API. In view of alack of industry wide standard for SSO APIs, applicationdevelopers find it almost impossible to SSO enable theirapplications to work with any vendor solution.
