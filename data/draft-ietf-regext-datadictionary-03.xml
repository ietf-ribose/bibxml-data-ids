    <abstract>
      <t>Multiple applications related to the registration of names and other identifiers are built around a list of data elements. There is currently no unified public list of these data elements, nor is there an organized and independent change control process. This document compiles the multiple similar but not quite identical lists of data elements into a neutral Data Dictionary to be maintained as an independent IANA Registry. The Data Dictionary defines data elements but does not specify which ones are to be used in any particular application; the Data Dictionary is policy-neutral.</t>
