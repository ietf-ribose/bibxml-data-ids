      <t>This document explores the potential of Information-Centric Networking (ICN) to enhance interoperability between metaverse platforms. ICN's content-centric approach, in-network caching, and inherent security features can address key challenges such as scalability, low-latency performance, data ownership, and standardization needs. It also identifies these challenges and proposes solutions to optimize data sharing, enable efficient content distribution, and enforce secure access controls.</t>
