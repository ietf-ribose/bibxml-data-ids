      <t>P2P Streaming has become popular application in the Internet. Currently, most home subscribers access Internet via ADSL, in which downlink bandwidth and uplink bandwidth are not symmetric. This feature would influence the performance of P2P Streaming, and the problem may be worse in mobile scenarios. This draft presents the interoperation between PPSP protocol and DECADE protocol to provide DECADE service for PPSP applications. Typically, there are two solution to achieve interoperation, loose interoperation among peers, and close interoperation via connection of peer and tracker. By introducing DECADE in both tracker protocol and peer protocol, PPSP streaming can alleviate strength of upload bandwidth and improve performance for fix and mobile scenario.</t>
