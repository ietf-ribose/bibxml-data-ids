    <abstract>
      <t>In packet transport networks, there are requirements where reverse unidirectional LSP of a bidirectional LSP needs to follow the same path as its forward unidirectional LSP. The bidirectional LSP needs to maintain co-routed-ness even after a failure event in the network. This document describes RSVP signaling to unambiguously bind two co- routed point-to-point LSPs into an associated co-routed bidirectional LSP. Fast-reroute procedures are defined to ensure that the traffic flows on the co-routed path after a failure event.</t>
