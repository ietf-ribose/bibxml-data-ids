    <abstract>
      <t>Recent research work has delved deeply into a new type of DNS security service, Protective DNS, through various measurement methods, and it has been deployed in multiple DNS providers and even in national ISPs. Protective DNS identifies whether the domain names requested by customers are in the threat intelligence (blocklist) it maintains. For domain names listed in the blocklist, it rewrites the resolution results to secure resources to prevent users from accessing malicious resources, such as malicious servers (IP addresses), etc. This document summarizes the conclusions of these research works and provides specific and practical considerations and suggestions for the deployment and operation of Protective DNS. By following these considerations, Protective DNS service providers can effectively enhance the practicality and security of their services.</t>
