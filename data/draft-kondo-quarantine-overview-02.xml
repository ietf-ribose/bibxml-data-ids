      <t>In the current Internet, a site is often secured by firewall, whichfilters harmful traffic from outside at the border of the site. This'Border Defense Model', provides only a single line of defence andhinders the deployment of many next-generation Internet applicationsand services.This memo surveys the security issues of the 'Border Defense Model',and proposes a network architecture 'Quarantine Model', to provide abetter security model and promote various end-to-end Internet usages.In our 'Quarantine Model', nodes shareing an Enterprise networknetwork are connected to separate logical networks according to theirsecurity privilege level and community of interest. A differentsecurity policy is implemented on each logical network segment usingthe multiple security-related techniques, such as filtering,authentication, and encryption. This 'Compartmentalized' frameworkprovides a better depth of network defenes and additional flexibilityto our 'Quarantine Model'.This memo enumerates requirements and issues for this architecture.However, it is beyond the scope of this document to propose specificimplementations or protocols.</t>
