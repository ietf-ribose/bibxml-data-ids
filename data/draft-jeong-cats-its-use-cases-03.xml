      <t>This document describes the applicability of Computing-Aware Traffic Steering (CATS) to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). CATS provides the steering of packets of a traffic flow for a specific service request toward the corresponding service instance at an edge computing server at a service site. CATS are applicable for Computing-Aware ITS including (i) Context-Aware Navigation Protocol (CNP) for Terrestrial Vehicles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), (ii) Edge-Assisted Cluster-Based MAC Protocol (ECMAC) for Software- Defined Vehicles, and (iii) Self-Adaptive Interactive Navigation Tool (SAINT) for Cloud-Based Navigation Services, and (iv) Cloud-Based Drone Navigation (CBDN) for Efficient Drone Battery Charging.</t>
