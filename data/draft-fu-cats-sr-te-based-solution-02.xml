    <abstract>
      <t>Computing-aware traffic steering (CATS) is a traffic engineering approach [I-D.ietf-teas-rfc3272bis] that takes into account the dynamic nature of computing resources and network state to optimize service-specific traffic forwarding towards a given service instance. Various relevant metrics may be used to enforce such computing-aware traffic steering policies.It is critical to meet different types of computing-aware traffic steering requirements without disrupting the existing network architecture. In this context, this document proposes a computing-aware traffic steering solution based on the SR- TE infrastructure of the current traffic engineering technology to reduce device resource consumption and investment and meet the requirements for computing-aware traffic steering of network devices.</t>
