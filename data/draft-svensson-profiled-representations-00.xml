    <abstract>
      <t>This document details approaches for enriching HTTP interactions with information pertaining to the profiles to which resource representations conform. It surveys approaches that were recently introduced to indicate the profile of a resource representation, and to make representations that conform to a profile discoverable. It introduces a generally applicable approach to negotiate for a resource representation that conforms to a profile preferred by a user agent. That approach leverages the existing content negotiation mechanism but applies it to the profile dimension to which it was previously not applied. The document also shows how a server can convey which profiled representations it is able to accept from a user agent.</t>
