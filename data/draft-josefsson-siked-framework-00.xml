      <t>The debate over whether to store cryptographic keys used by applications in the Domain Name System or not has been going on for some time. There are arguments for and against [6]. This document tries to take a step further and provides some initial terminology, problem statement and use cases for storing application keys in DNS, in order to enable more substantiated input to the discussion. We mention some proposed solutions so far. We also give some requirements on a solution (be it DNS based or not) that would satisfy the use cases.</t>
