      <t>The inter-satellite routing is the premis to ensure that the satellite network provides end-to-end stable service covering the whole world. However, the mature terrestrial network technologies are difficult to directly apply to the satellite network for the highly dynamic network topology and the limited on-board resources. This issue is further exacerbated in LEO mega-constellations. In view of this challenge, this document presents a routing framework for LEO mega-constellation. Based on the orbit position characteristic and the predictable topology, this framwork realizes flexible region division, establishes intra-region and inter-region path, as well as completes end-to-end data forwarding.</t>
