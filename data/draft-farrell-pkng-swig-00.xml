      <t>Current Internet protocols tend to be based on either X.509 basedPKI, or Kerberos. Both have limitations and age-related issues. Inthis draft, we outline a possible approach to providing similar, andadditional, functionality based on an abstract device that alwayssigns whatever its given, and that may additionally annotate ormodify its input in order to fulfill the security needs of otherprotocols. This draft describes a SWIG service and how it can beused to conduct research into a number of important problems inInternet trust and identity management today.</t>
