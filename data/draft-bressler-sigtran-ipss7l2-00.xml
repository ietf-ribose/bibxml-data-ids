      <t>This document proposes the use of TCP/IP as the transport protocol for common channel signaling, Signaling System #7 (SS7). The migration from the current 56k/64k physical layer to an IP based transport will reduce the cost associated with dedicated trunk based link. Also, the current signaling point (SP) network using quasi- associated architecture will be maintained to make the transition as seamless as possible.</t>
