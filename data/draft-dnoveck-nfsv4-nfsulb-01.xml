      <t>This document specifies Upper Layer Bindings to allow use of RPC- over-RDMA by protocols related to the Network File System (NFS). Such bindings are required when using RPC-over-RDMA, in order to enable use of Direct Data Placement and for a number of other reasons. These bindings are structured to be applicable to all known version of the RPC-over-RDMA transport, including optional extensions. All versions of NFS are addressed.</t>
