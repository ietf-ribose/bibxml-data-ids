      <t>The 'Synchronous IP Switching' protocol provides a framework for synchronous communication among end stations through an ethernet switch. This proposal enhances the capability of an ethernet switch to forward the packets from a variety of real time applications in a synchronous manner with less delay variations and consistent throughput by introducing the concept of 'Time Switch'. This protocol proves its importance, as more and more applications need constant delay, effective bandwidth while forwarding their packets to their destination.</t>
