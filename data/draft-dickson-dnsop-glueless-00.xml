      <t>This Internet Draft proposes a Best Current Practice for protecting authority servers against MITM and poisoning attacks, using a domain naming strategy to not require glue A/AAAA records and use of DNSSEC. This BCP assumes the use of validating resolvers, which should already be a BCP itself. MITM and poisoning attacks should only be effective/possible against unsigned domains. However, until all domains are signed, this guidance is relevant, in that it can limit the attack surface of unsigned domains. This guidance should be combined with [I-D.dickson-dnsop-ds-hack]</t>
