      <t>Deployment experience has demonstrated the value of using the Forwarding and Control Element Separation (ForCES) protocol to control the Forwarding Element Manager (FEM) by creating a Logical Functional Block (LFB) to represent its functionality, the FE Configuration (FEC) LFB . A Control Element (CE) that controls a Forwarding Element's (FE) resources can also manage its configuration via the FEC LFB. On a running FE, the CE may update the FE's runtime configuration via an FEC LFB e.g., by adding a new CE and its associated IP address). Additionally, in the case where we have a resource pool of FEs, the FEC may be used to initiate an FE into the Network Element cluster. This document introduces the FEC LFB, an LFB that specifies the configuration parameters of an FE.</t>
