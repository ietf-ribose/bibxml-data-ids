      <t>The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol needs to share its ratchet_tree object to welcome new clients into a group and in external joins. While, the protocol only defines a mechanism for sharing the entire tree, most implementations use various optimizations to avoid sending this structure repeatedly in large groups. This draft explores ways to convey these improvements in a standardized way and to convey parts of a GroupInfo object that are not visible to an intermediary server.</t>
