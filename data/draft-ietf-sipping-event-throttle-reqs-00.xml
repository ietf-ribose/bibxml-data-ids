      <t>All event packages are required to specify a maximum rate at which event notifications are generated by a single notifier. Such a limit is provided in order to reduce network congestion. In addition to the fixed limits introduced by specific event packages, further mechanisms for limiting the rate of event notification are also allowed to be defined by event package specifications but none have been specified so far. This memo discusses the requirements for a throttle mechanism that allows a subscriber to further limit the rate of event notification.</t>
