      <t>The mechanism for securely providing responder's identity in response message is missing in the current Session Initiation Protocol. Due to different call scenarios, the exact response identity is hard to guess through the existing response message. This draft describes some extensions for providing SIP response identity and two security mechanisms for verifying the integrity of response identity. It does so by defining new header fields as well as one new response code. Furthermore, the issue of how to require the presence of response identity in one SIP dialog is also discussed with one solution.</t>
