      <t>This document specify Mothma as a generic family of instantiated Post-Quantum/Traditional (PQ/T) Hybrid Digital Signatures. The goal is to provide a generic hybrid signature pattern that can be analysed separately for security assurance, and to offer concrete instantiated algorithms for integration into protocol and implementations. Identified instances are provided based on combinations of the traditional EdDSA, ECDSA and RSA methods with the post-quantum methods of ML-DSA, SLH-DSA, XMSS and LMS.</t>
