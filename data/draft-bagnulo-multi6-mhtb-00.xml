      <t>RFC 3178 [1] describes a solution to provide site multi-homing support in IPv6. RFC 3178 multi-homing solution uses tunnels between the different ISPs and the multi-homed site to provide alternative paths in case that one of the exit links is down, protecting the multi-homed site from outages in the direct link with its providers. However, the wide adoption of RFC 3178 multi-homing solution implies the manual configuration of numerous tunnels on the ISPs, which may impose an important workload in ISP network administrators. This note proposes the usage of Multi-Homing Tunnel Brokers to automatically configure the ISP tunnel endpoint in order to ease the adoption of the solution.</t>
