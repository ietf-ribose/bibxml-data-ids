      <t>RFC 3178 [1] describes a solution to provide site multi-homingsupport in IPv6. RFC 3178 multi-homing solution uses tunnels betweenthe different ISPs and the multi-homed site to provide alternativepaths in case that one of the exit links is down, protecting themulti-homed site from outages in the direct link with its providers.However, the wide adoption of RFC 3178 multi-homing solution impliesthe manual configuration of numerous tunnels on the ISPs, which mayimpose an important workload in ISP network administrators. This noteproposes the usage of Multi-Homing Tunnel Brokers to automaticallyconfigure the ISP tunnel endpoint in order to ease the adoption ofthe solution.</t>
