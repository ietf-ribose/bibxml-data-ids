    <abstract>
      <t>TLS-DPA is an experimental, identity-bound security protocol inspired by the design of TLS 1.3 ( [RFC8446] ). It is intended to operate consistently across environments where conventional IP address and port semantics are weak, unstable, or intentionally absent, including zero-port transports such as UZP ( [UZP] ). TLS-DPA generalises the handshake so it is not tied to server-side listeners, binds authentication to Service Identities rather than network coordinates, reduces metadata exposure to intermediaries (including rendezvous nodes in UZP fabrics), provides a unified hybrid-KEM post-quantum transition model ( [NIST-PQC] ), and supports session continuity across overlay path changes (e.g., QUIC Connection IDs; [RFC9000] ).</t>
