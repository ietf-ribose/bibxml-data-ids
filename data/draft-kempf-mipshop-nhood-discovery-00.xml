      <t>In wireless networks, there is a need to discover what types of networks are around a particular node. This need arises both when a node connects initially to a network and when a node needs to perform handover. Characteristics such as type of wireless technology, service provider, bandwidth availability, etc. may all be of interest in making a network connection or handover decision. In addition, a mobile node may require a mapping between the Layer 2 access point identifier and IP link information such as the Mobile IPv4 foreign agent address, or IPv6 access router address and subnet prefixes, so that the node can configure itself for the new IP link prior to moving. This document describes the Neighborhood information Elements Discovery (NED) protocol, for representing information elements that contain neighborhood information. The packet format presented in this document is independent of transport so that multiple mobility protocols can make use of it.</t>
