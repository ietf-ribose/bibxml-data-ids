      <t>This memo presents a possible solution to the multihoming in IPv6 problem. It borrows from earlier 8+8 and GSE proposals but it diverts from these approaches in order to be more readily deployable. A source host that wants to initiate communications looks up the IPv6 addresses that will function as the transport-layer identifier and the IP-level locators for the remote end in the DNS and collapses both of its own addresses into a single one. This makes it possible to communicate without prior negotiation, but without opening the door to trivial identity theft that must be repaired by cryptographic means.</t>
