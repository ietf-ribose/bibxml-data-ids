      <t>When an e-mail program generates an encrypted message to multiple recipients, it is possible that it has no encryption capability for at least one of the recipients. In this circumstance, an e-mail program may choose to send the message in cleartext to the recipient it cannot encrypt to. This draft currently offers several possible approaches when such a choice is made by the sender, so that the recipient can reason about and act on the cryptographic status of the message responsibly.</t>
