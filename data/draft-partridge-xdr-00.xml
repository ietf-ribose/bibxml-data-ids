      <t>Intermediate data formats (IDFs), also known as external data formats or data-interchange formats, are used to exchange data between networked applications. Example formats are JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1). IDFs are ubiquitous in networking. Despite their importance, there's remarkably little written guidance about how to actually design or architect an IDF. This guidance gap exists despite fifty years of experience designing and deploying IDFs, going back to the days of ARPANET. As a result, even recently developed IDFs have obvious flaws that could have been avoided. The purpose of this memo is to provide basic basic guidance about how to design an IDF. This memo is NOT the product of any IETF or IRTF working group.</t>
