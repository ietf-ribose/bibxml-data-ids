      <t>The text/plain media type is defined to represent plain text where the CRLF sequence represents a line break [MIME-IMT]. Many modern computer systems have a different concept of ``plain text'' from the systems where the text/plain media type originated. These modern systems usually use a proportional-spaced font and use CRLF to represent paragraph breaks. Numerous software products have erroneously labelled this media type as text/plain. In order to correct this interoperability problem, the text/paragraph media type is defined. [NOTE: This proposal may be discussed publicly on the ietf- 822@imc.org mailing list.
