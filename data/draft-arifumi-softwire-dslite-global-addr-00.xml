      <t>When an ISP tries to deploy IPv6 and take an action for IPv4 address depletion, DS-Lite is reasonable approach for solving both of the problems. However, it is troublesome for an ISP to have the existing IPv4 service facilities and DS-Lite facilities at the same time for not a short period of time. This document proposes a mechanism to assign an IPv4 global address in DS-Lite framework, which makes every customer to move to DS-Lite based network, and enables an ISP to maintain single facility of the service network.</t>
