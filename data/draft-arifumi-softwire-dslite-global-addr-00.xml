      <t>When an ISP tries to deploy IPv6 and take an action for IPv4 addressdepletion, DS-Lite is reasonable approach for solving both of theproblems. However, it is troublesome for an ISP to have the existingIPv4 service facilities and DS-Lite facilities at the same time fornot a short period of time. This document proposes a mechanism toassign an IPv4 global address in DS-Lite framework, which makes everycustomer to move to DS-Lite based network, and enables an ISP tomaintain single facility of the service network.</t>
