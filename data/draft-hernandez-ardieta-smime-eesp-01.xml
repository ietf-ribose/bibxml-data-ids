      <t>This document defines extended electronic signature policies (ext-SP)that extend the boundaries of the electronic signature policy defined in[RFC3125] in a manner that the relationships and dependences amongmultiple electronic signatures generated within the scope of the sameelectronic transaction can be established. A given legal/contractualcontext may recognize a particular ext-SP as meeting its requirements.An ext-SP has a globally unique reference, which is bound to anelectronic signature by the signer as part of the signature calculation.The ext-SP can be defined in human readable form so that it can beassessed to meet the requirements of the legal and contractual contextin which it is being applied.To allow for the automatic processing, the ext-SP specifies, using acomputer processable form, the timing and sequence dependencies of theset of signatures that must be generated to make the transactioneffective along with the set of attributes and rules that each signaturemust comply with. In the current document the format of the ext-SP isdefined using ASN.1.The content of this document is based on the requirements and needsestablished in ETSI TR 102 045 V1.1.1 (2003-03) Copyright (C).Individual copies of this ETSI deliverable can be downloaded fromhttp://www.etsi.org.Discussion This draft is being discussed on the 'ietf-smime' mailing list.
