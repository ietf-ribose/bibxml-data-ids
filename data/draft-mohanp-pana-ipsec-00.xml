      <t>The PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access) working group is developing protocol for authenticating clients to the access network using IP based protocols. The PANA protocol authenticates the client and also establishes a PANA security association between the PANA client and PANA authentication agent at the end of a successful authentication. But it does not specify any mechanism for preventing service theft. This document discusses the details for establishing an IPsec security association for securing the link between PANA client and the enforcement point, which can be used to prevent service theft.</t>
