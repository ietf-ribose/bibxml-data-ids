      <t>Content Distribution Network Interconnection (CDNI) is predicated on the ability of downstream CDNs (dCDNs) to handle end-user requests in a functionally equivalent manner to the upstream CDN (uCDN). The uCDN must be able to assess the ability of the dCDN to handle individual requests. The CDNI Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI) is provided for the advertisement of capabilities and the footprints to which they apply by the dCDN to the uCDN. This document describes an approach to implementing the CDNI FCI.</t>
