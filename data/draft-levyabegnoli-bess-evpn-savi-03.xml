    <abstract>
      <t>Source Address Validation procedures have been specified in the SAVI Working Group and provide a set of mechanisms and state machines to verify Source Address ownership. The main mechanisms are described in RFC6620 and RFC7513. RFC7432 and furthermore RFC9161 specify how an EVPN network could learn and distribute IP addressess. RFC9161 describes a mechanism by which the PE can proxy some ND messages based on this information. In this document, we review how these two sets of specifications and underlying mechanisms can interact to provide Source Address Validation in an EVPN network.</t>
