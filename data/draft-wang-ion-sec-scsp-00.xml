      <t>Server Cache Synchronization Protocol SCSP [1], [2], [3], [4] is used to solve the generalized cache synchronization/cache -replication problem for distributed protocol entities. In a client-server paradigm, SCSP synchronizes caches (or a portion of the caches) of a set of server entities of a particular protocol which are bound to a Server Group. This document provided a security analysis of the current SCSP framework and identified potential threats to the protocol operation. Possible solutions to secure the SCSP from potential attacks are presented and discussed.</t>
