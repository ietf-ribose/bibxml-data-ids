    <abstract>
      <t>Key to the extensibility of the Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) protocol has been the handling of unsupported and/or invalid Type/Length/Value (TLV) tuples. Although there are explicit statements in existing specifications, in some cases the expected behavior is "well known" but not explicitly stated. This document discusses the "well known behaviors" and makes them explicit in order to insure that interoperability is maximized. This document when approved updates RFC3563, RFC5305, and RFC6233.</t>
