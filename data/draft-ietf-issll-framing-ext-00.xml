      <t>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [2] provides a standard method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links. PPP datagrams are often encapsulated in HDLC frames [1] when used over standard analog modems. This document describes the extensions to PPP encapsulation and HDLC framing to support Quality of Service (QoS) over low bandwidth links. This document is a submission to the IETF ISSLL working group. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at issll@mercury.lcs.mit.edu and/or the author. This document is an update of the previous version which was named 'draft-andrades-framing-ext-00.txt' and was revised as a result of discussions with Carsten Bormann, as well as the discussions at the September 30th meeting of the ISSLL working group.</t>
