      <t>Isolating the access to mobility agents by the VPN gateway which guards the home agent, home resources is disturbing the operations of mobile node away from its home that needed to perform the registration of the current location according to the specification because the access from the outside is restricted by the VPN policy. This paper presents the authentication and key exchange scheme using the AAA infrastructure for a user in Internet to access the Intranet behind the VPN gateway. By defining the role of authentication and tunnel processing for each agent or relaying entity, we are able to obtain our goal to the security-aware environment. Also, the performance result of the proposed scheme is discussed in depth.</t>
