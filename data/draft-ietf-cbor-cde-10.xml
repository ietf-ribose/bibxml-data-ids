      <t>CBOR (STD 94, RFC 8949) defines "Deterministically Encoded CBOR" in its Section 4.2, providing some flexibility for application specific decisions. To facilitate Deterministic Encoding to be offered as a selectable feature of generic encoders, the present document defines a CBOR Common Deterministic Encoding (CDE) that can be shared by a large set of applications with potentially diverging detailed requirements. It also defines the term "Basic Serialization", which stops short of the potentially more onerous requirements that make CDE fully deterministic, while employing most of its reductions of the variability needing to be handled by decoders.</t>
