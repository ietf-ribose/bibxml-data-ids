    <abstract>
      <t>This paper shows that the currently defined per-message hop-by-hop mechanism doesn22t scale for large deployments and is not feasible for scalable IM conferencing. Instead, the paper proposes to replace this mechanism with an MSRP layer per TCP connection keep-alive mechanism. This paper also reinforces the need for the end-to-end mechanism to be defined in the core MSRP specification and to become the abstraction for all MSRP applications regardless the underlying topology in use.</t>
