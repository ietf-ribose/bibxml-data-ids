      <t>This document describes an extensible mechanism that allows a RIPv2 [RIP2] speaker to advertise summarized routes to its peers without changing the format of the RESPONSE message. Summarized routes are carried in RESPONSE message like normal RIPv2 routes. Summarized routes are treated as normal routes on the receiving side. No extra provisions are required to discriminate between summarized and normal routes. The mechanisms described in this document is OPTIONAL and is applicable to all RIPv2 speaking routers, with some modifications in the routing information base and output processing for storing and advertising summary routes. This mechanism cannot be applied to RIPv1 [RIP1].</t>
