      <t>As technologies that enable bidirectional communication over HTTPhave become more pervasive, interest has grown in (1) definingimproved mechanisms for support of existing technologies (short-termsolutions such as new HTTP headers) and (2) laying the foundation fordevelopment of new bidirectional protocols (long-term solutions suchas WebSocket, Bidirectional Web Transfer Protocol, and Reverse HTTP).In order to provide context for such work, this document provides afirst tentative map of the design space for bidirectional HTTP, withspecial attention to deployed infrastructure (e.g. web clients,intermediaries, firewalls, NATs, web servers) and programmingenvironments.</t>
