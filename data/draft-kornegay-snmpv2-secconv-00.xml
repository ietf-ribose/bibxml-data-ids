      <t>The purpose of this memo is to focus discussion and work on security models for the Internet SNMP, and to define conventions promoting experimentation with various potential methods of solution. These conventions are based on the concepts of authentication service and authentication schemes as defined in RFC 1157. These conventions promote such experimentation in a transparent way without changing the formats of messages exchanged by SNMP protocol entities, and without changing the elements of procedure for SNMP entities. In fact, most currently deployed SNMP implementations could be classified as one of the compliance definitions defined in this memo. These conventions rely on the consistent configuration of the peer SNMP protocol entities, and on non-null authentication service transforms of the SNMP 'Message.data' field (trivial authentication is considered an implementation of a null authentication service transform). It is hoped that this memo, along with complementary memos written by other interested parties, will result in a better understanding of SNMP security models, interoperable experimental security models, and eventually the adoption of standards.</t>
