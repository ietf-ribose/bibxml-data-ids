      <t>This document describes the use of the Roaming Relationship (REL) record in the DNS for the description of roaming relationships. REL resource records may be used for determining the existence of a roaming relationship path between the local ISP and the user's home domain, as well as the location of an appropriate accounting agent. However, unless the roaming relationship path is authenticated by some method (such as via tokens or certificates returned by the home authentication server), hierarchical authentication routing must be used in order to validate the path.</t>
