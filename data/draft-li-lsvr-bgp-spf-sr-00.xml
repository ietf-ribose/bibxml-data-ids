    <abstract>
      <t>For network scenarios such as Massively Scaled Data Centers (MSDCs), BGP is extended for Link-State (LS) distribution and the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm based calculation. BGP-LS SPF leverages the mechanisms of both BGP protocol and BGP-LS protocol extensions. Segment Routing (SR) provides a source routing mechanism that allows a flow to be restricted to a specific topological path, while maintaining per-flow state only at the ingress node(s) to the SR domain. In some networks, it may be useful to enable SR based source routing mechanism together with BGP-LS SPF. This document proposes to introduce the BGP Link-State (BGP-LS) extensions for segment routing to the BGP-LS SPF SAFI.</t>
