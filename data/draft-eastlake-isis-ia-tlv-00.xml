      <t>This document specifies an IS-IS (Intermediate System to Intermediate System) TLV that enables the reporting by an Intermediate System of sets of addresses of different types such that all of the addresses in each set designate the same interface. For example, an EUI-48 MAC (Extended Unique Identifier 48-bit, Media Access Control) address, IPv4 address, and IPv6 address can be reported as all corresponding to the same interface. Such information could be used, for example, to synthesize responses to or by-pass the need for the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) or the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol in some cases.</t>
