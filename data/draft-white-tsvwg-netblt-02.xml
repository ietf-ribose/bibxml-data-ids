    <abstract>
      <t>This document is a specification of version 5 of Network Block Transfer Protocol (NETBLT), that is used for transferring large amount of data. This protocol was firstly specified in RFC 969, that has been made obsolete by RFC 998. Nevertheless, none of these documents match current Internet Standards and are outdated. This document aligns the NETBLT specification with the most current Internet Standards and obsoletes RFC 998.</t>
