      <t>GMPLS [2] has now been proposed as an extension to the MPLS framework to include non packet-switched optical technologies, such as time-division multiplexing (PDH/SDH/SONET) and wavelength division multiplexing (lambdas/fibers). This draft proposes an enhanced label request format for such optical technologies, which accounts for some special characteristics of these technologies (see, for instance, [3], [4], [5])that differentiate them from packet-switched technologies. When enumerating our encoding, we focus, for clarity, on optical TDM technologies, since the standards for these are well-defined, but it will be seen that the proposal has very general applicability.</t>
