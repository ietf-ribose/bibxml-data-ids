    <abstract>
      <t>DNS filtering is widely deployed for network security but filtered DNS responses lack information for the end user to understand the reason for the filtering. Existing mechanisms to provide detail to end users cause harm especially if the blocked DNS response is to an HTTPS website. This document defines a mechanism to explain the reason for the DNS filtering and provides HTTPS URIs to get more detail. This information can be parsed by the client and displayed, logged, or used for other purposes. This document updates RFC8914 to contain I-JSON in its EXTRA-TEXT field.</t>
