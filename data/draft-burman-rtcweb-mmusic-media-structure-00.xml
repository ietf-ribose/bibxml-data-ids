      <t>There are currently significant efforts ongoing in IETF regarding more advanced multi-media functionalities, such as the work related to RTCWEB and CLUE. This work includes use cases for both multi- party communication and multiple media streams from an individual end-point. The usage of scalable encoding or simulcast encoding as well as different types of transport mechanisms have created additional needs to correctly identify different types of resources and describe their relations to achieve intended functionalities. The different usages have both commonalities and differences in needs and behavior. This document attempts to review some usages and identify commonalities and needs. It then continues to highlight important aspects that need to be considered in the definition of these usages.</t>
