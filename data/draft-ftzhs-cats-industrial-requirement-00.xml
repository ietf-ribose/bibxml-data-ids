    <abstract>
      <t>The Industrial Internet is a new infrastructure, application mode and industrial ecology with the deep integration among the new information technology, communication technology and the industrial economy.Industrial production tasks are time-sensitive, which put forward high requirements on networks and applications, and need to meet the deterministic requirements in terms of delay, jitter, reliability, etc. Industrial deterministic service refers to a closed loop composed of communication paths and control processes in which two or more applications participate.Industrial management platforms need to unify network forwarding and computing tasks for each deterministic service. This draft illustrates use cases of traffic steering for deterministic service in terms of dynamic computing and networking resource status,together with the requirements and solutions for CATS(Computing-Aware Traffic Steering).</t>
