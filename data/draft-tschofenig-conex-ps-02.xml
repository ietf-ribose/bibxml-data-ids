      <t>The increasingly ubiquitous availability of broadband, together withflat-rate pricing, have made for increasing congestion problems onthe network, which are often caused by a small number of usersconsuming a large amount of bandwidth. In some cases, building outmore capacity to handle this new congestion may be infeasible orunwarranted. As a result, network operators have sought other waysto manage congestion both from their own users and from othernetworks. These different types of solutions have differentstrengths and weaknesses, but all of them are limited in a number ofkey ways.This document discusses the problems created for operators by high-consuming users and describes the strengths and weaknesses of anumber of techniques operators are currently using to cope with highbandwidth usage. The discussion of these solutions ultimately pointsto a need for a new kind of congestion accounting.</t>
