    <abstract>
      <t>There are many situations in which it is desirable to take measurements of data which people consider sensitive. In these cases, the entity taking the measurement is usually not interested in people's individual responses but rather in aggregated data. Conventional methods require collecting individual responses and then aggregating them on some server, thus representing a threat to user privacy and rendering many such measurements difficult and impractical. This document describes a multi-party Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP) for privacy preserving measurement which can be used to collect aggregate data without revealing any individual contributor's data.</t>
