    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a new Mechanism and DNS resource record (RR) type to carry information about energy-related characteristics for end-to-end internet access. The "EE" ("Energy Efficiency") record allows the network to provide different levels of energy-saving service. By providing more energy information to the client before it attempts to establish a connection, these records offer potential benefits to enhancements on energy as service criteria.</t>
