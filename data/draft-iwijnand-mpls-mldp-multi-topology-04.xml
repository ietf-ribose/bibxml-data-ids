      <t>The Multi-Topology Routing (MTR) enables service differentiation through class-based forwarding. IGP protocols (OSPF and IS-IS) and LDP have already been extended to setup MTR. In order to deploy mLDP in an MTR network, mLDP is also required to become topology-aware. This document specifies extensions to mLDP to support Multi-Topology Routing.</t>
