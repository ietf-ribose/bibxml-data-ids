      <t>This document proposes extensions to RELOAD to support flexible client promotion and demotion modes. RELOAD aims at providing a uniform protocol for both overlay clients and peers, where promotion of a client to peer is triggered and completed at the client's pleasure. It is proposed that RELOAD provide a more restrictive framework to enable passive promotion and demotion, where decisions are made by the network rather than individual user-owned nodes.</t>
