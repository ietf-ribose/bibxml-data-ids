      <t>Unencrypted plaintext passwords are the biggest single risk to Internet application protocol security. Unfortunately, they are widely deployed, often tightly integrated into operating system services and very difficult to replace in an interoperable fashion. This specification discusses some methods which can be used to eliminate unencrypted plaintext passwords. It also defines a SASL mechanism [SASL] which may be used by newer protocols such as ACAP [ACAP] to transition away from a legacy authentication database.</t>
