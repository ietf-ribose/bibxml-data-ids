      <t>This document is a proposal to add a new event/signal package to theMegaco protocol to control an ARF (Audio Resource Function) which mayreside on a Media Gateway or specialized Audio Server.This event package provides support for the standard IVR operationsof PlayAnnouncement, PlayCollect, and PlayRecord. It supports directreferences to simple audio as well as indirect references to simpleand complex audio. It provides audio variables, control of audiointerruptibility, digit buffer control, special key sequences, andsupport for reprompting during data collection. It also provides anarbitrary number of user defined qualifiers to be used in resolvingcomplex audio structures. For example, the user could define qualif-iers for any or all of the following: language, accent, audio fileformat, gender, speaker, or customer.</t>
