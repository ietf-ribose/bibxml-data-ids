      <t>This paper provides an architecture for allocating IPng addresses in the Internet. This paper does not go into the details of an addressing plan. This paper focuses on addressing for a particular proposal known as BigTen, but the general principles apply to any hierarchically allocated address space. The IPng address space is a finite shared resource that must be managed for the good of the community. The managers of this resource are acting as its custodians. They have a responsibility to the community to manage it for the common good.</t>
