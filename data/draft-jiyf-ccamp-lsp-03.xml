      <t>As the increment of network scale, optical networks need to be partitioned into multi-layer and multi-domain networks for the purpose of better management. Meanwhile, as the variety of user requests, different LSPs need to be established. In order to meet different requirements of users, the LSP establishment performance is necessary to be measured in multi-layer and multi-domain networks. For this reason, typical performance measurement metrics need to be proposed. In this document, the LSP establishment delay and bit error ratio (BER), which are both as the performance measurement metrics, are illustrated, and the definition and methodologies are proposed.</t>
