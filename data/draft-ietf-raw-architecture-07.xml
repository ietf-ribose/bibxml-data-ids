      <t>Reliable and Available Wireless (RAW) provides for high reliability and availability for IP connectivity across any combination of wired and wireless network segments. The RAW Architecture extends the DetNet Architecture and other standard IETF concepts and mechanisms to adapt to the specific challenges of the wireless medium. This document defines an architecture element for the RAW data plane, in the form of an OODA loop, that optimizes the use of constrained spectrum and energy while maintaining the expected connectivity properties. It also introduces a new Control plane Function to prepare alternate paths to go around local failures. The loop involves OAM, PCE, and PREOF extensions, and a new component called the Path Selection Engine (PSE).</t>
