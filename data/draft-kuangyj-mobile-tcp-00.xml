    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines two types of IP addresses to support mobile TCP - one for routing and location management, the other for host identification. Therefore, the dependency of TCP/UDP socket identification upon the network layer is eliminated, and transmission sessions will be no longer dependent of network layer IP address, that is, location changes of a mobile host result only new network IP address, which has no impact on transmission communications and its continuity.</t>
