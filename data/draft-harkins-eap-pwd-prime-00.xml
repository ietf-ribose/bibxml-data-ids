      <t>Passwords are a popular form of credential for user authentication. EAP-pwd (RFC 5931) is a popular method of performing secure password authenticaiton. EAP-pwd requires a secret element in a finite cyclic group, unfortunately the technique it uses to derive this secret is open to timing and cache attacks. This improved version, EAP-pwd', uses a different technique to derive the secret element which is resistant to timing and cache attacks.</t>
