    <abstract>
      <t>Network performance, especially network latency is widely recognized as one of major obstacles in adopting public cloud services (e.g., cloud desktop service), especially in the scenario where the network paths between cloud end-users and cloud data centers traverse more than one Autonomous System (AS). However, the current Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) specification [RFC4271] doesn't use network performance metrics (e.g., network latency) in the route selection decisions. This document describes a performance-based BGP routing mechanism in which network latency metric is taken as one of the route selection criteria.</t>
