      <t>The Internet is an amazing achievement - any of the thousand millionhosts can freely use any of the resources anywhere on the publicnetwork. At least that was the original theory. Recently issueswith how these resources are shared among these hosts have come tothe fore. Applications are innocently exploring the limits ofprotocol design to get larger shares of available bandwidth.Increasingly we are seeing ISPs imposing restrictions on heavierusage in order to try to preserve the level of service they can offerto lighter customers. We believe that these are symptoms of anunderlying problem: fair resource sharing is an issue that can onlybe resolved at run-time, but for years attempts have been made tosolve it at design time. In this document we show that fairness isnot the preserve of transport protocols, rather the design of suchprotocols should be such that fairness can be controlled betweenusers and ISPs at run-time.</t>
