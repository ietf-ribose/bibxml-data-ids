      <t>EVPN IRB has been deployed following [RFC9135]'s early draft for a long time. This draft discusses how can these existing deployments smoothly evolved into an IP-aliasing ([I-D.sajassi-bess-evpn-ip-aliasing]) enhanced EVPN symmetric IRB scenario, especially when two of an IP-VRF's BDs (whose IRB interfaces are attached to the same IP-VRF) have been attched to a common ES before that network evolution. In such case, when these two BDs are evolved into IP-aliasing enhanced EVPN symmetric IRB as per [I-D.sajassi-bess-evpn-ip-aliasing] or distributed Bump-in-the- wire as per [I-D.wang-bess-evpn-distributed-bump-in-the-wire], the IP A-D per EVI routes of these two BDs may conflict with each other in the context of the IP-VRF instance.</t>
