      <t>In-band operation and maintenance management (IOAM, In-band OAM), as a network performance monitoring technology, is based on the principle of path-associated detection to perform specific field marking/coloring and identification on actual service flows, and perform packet loss and delay measurement. It can quickly perceive network performance-related faults, and accurately delimit boundaries and do troubleshooting. However, the current IOAM solution has shortcomings too. For example, after the service traffic path switching, the IOAM cannot continue working. This paper proposes a scheme to achieve automatic performance monitoring through service path switching and linkage with IOAM, which enhances the feasibility of the IOAM scheme in large-scale deployment and the completeness of IOAM technology.</t>
