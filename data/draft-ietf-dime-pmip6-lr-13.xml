      <t>In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by the Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typically tunneled to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing. The term "localized routing" refers to a method by which packets are routed directly between an MN's MAG and the MAG of its Correspondent Node (CN) without involving any LMA. In order to establish a localized routing session between two Mobile Access Gateways in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, the usage of localized routing may be authorized for both MAGs. This document specifies how to accomplish this using the Diameter protocol.</t>
