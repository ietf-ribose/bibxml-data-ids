      <t>Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 [RFC2461] provides a way by which thenodes can determine whether to use administered protocol for addressautoconfiguration and other non-address information through M and Obits in the Router Advertisements. Though RAs can notify nodes of achange in the address prefixes, currently there is no way the nodescan learn that there is a change in the non-address configurationparameters. This will make the nodes unable to learn about new orchanged configuration parameters like DNS server addresses. Thisspecification extends the Neighbor Discovery protocol [RFC2461] tonotify the nodes that the other information obtained through anadministered protocol has been changed.</t>
