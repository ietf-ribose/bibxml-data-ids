      <t>Neighbor Discovery for IPv6 [RFC2461] provides a way by which the nodes can determine whether to use administered protocol for address autoconfiguration and other non-address information through M and O bits in the Router Advertisements. Though RAs can notify nodes of a change in the address prefixes, currently there is no way the nodes can learn that there is a change in the non-address configuration parameters. This will make the nodes unable to learn about new or changed configuration parameters like DNS server addresses. This specification extends the Neighbor Discovery protocol [RFC2461] to notify the nodes that the other information obtained through an administered protocol has been changed.</t>
