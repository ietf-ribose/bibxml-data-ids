      <t>The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is developing thecapability to support different communication services on IPMultimedia Subsystem (IMS) as a SIP infrastructure, such as push-to-talk over cellular (PoC), Multimedia Telephony or IMS messaging. Asthere are different services and is not safe to rely on the expressedmedia as a means to identify the requested communication servicebecause the media may be used in different communication services,then there is the need to have an unambiguous way of identifyingcommunication services and applications utilizing the logic ofcommunication services as explicitly as possible. In this document,we express the requirements identified by 3GPP to support theidentification of communication services and applications on aSession Initiation Protocol (SIP) infrastructure and IMS applicationsusing them.</t>
