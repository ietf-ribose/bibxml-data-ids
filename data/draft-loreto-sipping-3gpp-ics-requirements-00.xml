      <t>The 3rd-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is developing the capability to support different communication services on IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) as a SIP infrastructure, such as push-to- talk over cellular (PoC), Multimedia Telephony or IMS messaging. As there are different services and is not safe to rely on the expressed media as a means to identify the requested communication service because the media may be used in different communication services, then there is the need to have an unambiguous way of identifying communication services and applications utilizing the logic of communication services as explicitly as possible. In this document, we express the requirements identified by 3GPP to support the identification of communication services and applications on a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) infrastructure and IMS applications using them.</t>
