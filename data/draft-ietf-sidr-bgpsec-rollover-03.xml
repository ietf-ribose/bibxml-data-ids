      <t>BGPSEC will need to address the impact from regular and emergency rollover processes for the BGPSEC End-Entity (EE) certificates that will be performed by Certificate Authorities (CAs) participating at the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). Rollovers of BGPSEC EE certificates must be carefully managed in order to synchronize distribution of router public keys and the usage of those pubic keys by BGPSEC routers. This document provides general recommendations for that process, as well as describing reasons why the rollover of BGPSEC EE certificates might be necssary.</t>
