      <t>Recently there has been interest in using DHCP for configuring clients accessing the Internet through some form of high-speed access technology such as cable or ADSL [DHC-AGENT]. In addition, although DHCP was initially designed for configuring fixed hosts, proposals are being made to enhance DHCP to support roaming/mobile clients [DHC-ENHANCE]. These two trends have put in evidence the need for a coupling between AAA and DHCP. Some initial requirements for DHCP/AAA have been proposed in [DHC-AAA]. This document proposes a different model in which AAA procedures are invoked not from a DHCP server but from a DHCP relay agent to make sure that ALL the Internet Access features supported by the PPP model can be replicated in a DHCP based Internet Access environment.</t>
