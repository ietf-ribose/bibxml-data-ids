      <t>The control protocol used for constructing Point-to-Multipoint andMultipoint-to-Multipoint Label Switched Paths ("MP LSPs") contains afield that identifies the address of a "root node". Intermediatenodes are expected to be able to look up that address in theirrouting tables. However, if the route to the root node is a BGProute, and the intermediate nodes are part of a BGP-free core, thisis not possible. This document specifies procedures which enable aMP LSP to be constructed through a BGP-free core. In theseprocedures, the root node address is temporarily replaced by anaddress which is known to the intermediate nodes.</t>
