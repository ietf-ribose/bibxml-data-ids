      <t>The Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) suite of protocol has been defined to control different switching technologies as well as different applications. These include support for requesting TDM connections including SONET/SDH and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs). This document concentrates on the signaling aspects of the GMPLS suite of protocols. It identifies the features to be covered by the signalling protocol to support the capabilities of an Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON). This document provides a problem statement and additional requirements on the GMPLS signaling protocol to support the ASON functionality.</t>
