      <t>The Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) suite of protocol has been defined tocontrol different switching technologies as well as differentapplications. These include support for requesting TDM connectionsincluding SONET/SDH and Optical Transport Networks (OTNs).This document concentrates on the signaling aspects of the GMPLSsuite of protocols. It identifies the features to be covered by thesignalling protocol to support the capabilities of an AutomaticallySwitched Optical Network (ASON). This document provides a problemstatement and additional requirements on the GMPLS signalingprotocol to support the ASON functionality.</t>
