      <t>The period of IPv4/IPv6 transisation will last for a long time.Different phases of IPv4/IPv6 transisation have different scenarioesand requirements thus need different solutions. In the early stageof IPv4/IPv6 transisation, sicne the majority of the Internetresources locate in the IPv4 Internet, the main communication type ofthe IPv4/IPv6 transition is v6 to v4 which is the IPv6 clients iniatecommunication to the IPv4 servers. At the later stage of the IPv4/IPv6 transisation, the servers may locate in the IPv6 network/Internet, in this scenario, there is a need for the legacy IPv4client to iniate communication to the IPv6 servers. This documentanalyses the problems of v4 to v6 communication and discusses asolution called PNAT-Lite.</t>
