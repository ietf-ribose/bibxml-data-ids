      <t>The ability to compute constrained shortest Traffic Engineering (TE)Label Switched Paths (LSPs) in Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks across multiple domains (wherea domain is referred to as a collection of network elements within acommon sphere of address management or path computationalresponsibility such as IGP areas and Autonomous Systems) has beenidentified as a key requirement . This document specifies aprocedure relying on the use of multiple Path Computation Elements(PCEs) in order to compute such inter-domain shortest constraintpaths along a determined sequence of domains, using a backwardrecursive path computation technique while preserving confidentialityacross domains, which is sometimes required when domains are managedby different Service Providers.</t>
