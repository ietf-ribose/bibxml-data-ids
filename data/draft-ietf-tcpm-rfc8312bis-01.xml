    <abstract>
      <t>CUBIC is an extension to the traditional TCP standards. It differs from the traditional TCP standards only in the congestion control algorithm on the sender side. In particular, it uses a cubic function instead of the linear window increase function of the traditional TCP standards to improve scalability and stability under fast and long-distance networks. CUBIC has been adopted as the default TCP congestion control algorithm by the Linux, Windows, and Apple stacks. This document updates the specification of CUBIC to include algorithmic improvements based on these implementations and recent academic work. Based on the extensive deployment experience with CUBIC, it also moves the specification to the Standards Track, obsoleting [RFC8312].</t>
