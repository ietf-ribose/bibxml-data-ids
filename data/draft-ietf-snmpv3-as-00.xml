      <t>This document attempts to put in perspective the use of cryptographicalgorithms in the Simple Network Monitoring Protocol Version 3standard. In particular, it notes that today's standard isinfinitely more secure than previous versions, as the previousversions had zero security. It further notes that, as cryptographicalgorthim developments change over time, we expect that therecommended algorithms will change when the security community hasreached new consensus.</t>
