    <abstract>
      <t>This document attempts to put in perspective the use of cryptographic algorithms in the Simple Network Monitoring Protocol Version 3 standard. In particular, it notes that today's standard is infinitely more secure than previous versions, as the previous versions had zero security. It further notes that, as cryptographic algorthim developments change over time, we expect that the recommended algorithms will change when the security community has reached new consensus.</t>
