      <t>This document defines a new streaming report block for the Extended Report (XR) packet type for the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) [1]. XR packets are an extension to the reception report blocks of RTCP sender report (SR) or Receiver Report (RR) packets. In [1] seven report blocks are defined to receive various information that helps the sender to monitor the network and assess quality of VoIP delivery. In this document we define a new report block for the XR packet, namely the streaming report block, to receive statistics about the quality of an audio and/or video streaming session.</t>
