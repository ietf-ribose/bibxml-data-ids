      <t>The Host Identity Protocol implements the identifier locator separation by introduing a new name space and a new layer to the IP stack. The new structure insulates the transport layer protocols from the internetworking layer, thereby allowing transport sessions to remain unaffected even if the underlying IP addresses change. That, in turn, seems to make it easier to solve the so called site multi-homing problem than without introducing such an indirection layer. This document discusses how the proposed HIP mobility and multi-homing solution, described separately, would fit to the IETF multi6 working group requirements.</t>
