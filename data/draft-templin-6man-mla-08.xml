    <abstract>
      <t>Mobile Ad-hoc NETworks (MANETs) present an interesting challenge for IPv6 addressing due to the indeterminant neighborhood properties of MANET interfaces. MANET routers must assign an IPv6 address to each MANET interface that is both unique and routable within the MANET but must not be forwarded to other networks. MANET routers must be able to assign self-generated addresses to their MANET interfaces when there is no infrastructure present that can coordinate topology- relative IPv6 addresses or prefixes. This document therefore specifies a means for MANET routers to generate and assign address types useful for MANET local communications.</t>
