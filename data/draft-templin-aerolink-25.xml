      <t>This document specifies the operation of IPv6 over tunnel virtual Non-Broadcast, Multiple Access (NBMA) links using Asymmetric Extended Route Optimization (AERO). Nodes attached to AERO links can exchange packets via trusted intermediate routers that provide forwarding services to reach off-link destinations and redirection services for route optimization. AERO provides an IPv6 link-local address format known as the AERO address for operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol. Admission control and provisioning are supported by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6), and node mobility is naturally supported through dynamic neighbor cache updates.</t>
