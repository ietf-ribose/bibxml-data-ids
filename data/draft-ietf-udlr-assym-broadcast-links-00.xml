      <t>Satellite hops, the region between a basestation and a set of mobile nodes, and a number of other similar scenarios represent a challenge to providing IP connectivity at various levels due to the 1-many broadcast nature of the link. The UDLR group has addressed these problems in some limited situations. The general case, where multiple, possibly partially intersecting set of such hops are part of a general set of Internet Paths (or need to be considered in the route computation that will buld such paths) is complex. This note is an attempt to outline a framework for the general case. We include certain recent approaches to managing connectivity that also include quality of service, multiple alternate paths, and traffic engineering considerations. In this version of this note, we are discussing techniques for connectivity, so mechanisms and techniques described are applicable to routers. We would need a seperate (and hopefully much simpler) set of mechanisms to incorporate hosts that exist on a unidirectional link or path that includes such links.</t>
