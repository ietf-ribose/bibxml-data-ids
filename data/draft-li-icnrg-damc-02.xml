    <abstract>
      <t>This draft defines a new communication architecture, called Distributed Architecture for Microservices Communication (DAMC). It includes multiple aspects of microservice communication, such as service registration, service discovery, service routing, service scheduling, and more, Which to achieve all the essential functionalities provided by current centralized service networks. The purpose of this draft is to combine the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) concept to enhance the overall performance, scalability and reliability of microservices communication. The DAMC architecture provides a powerful framework for managing the complex communication requirements of distributed microservices, ensuring integrity, security and efficient resource utilization.</t>
