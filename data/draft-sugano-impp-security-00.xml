      <t>This memo describes the current results of the author's investigations into decisions required for security issues in IMPP protocol design. We discuss possible options for methods of authentication and encryption appropriate to IMPP requirements. In particular, we propose our design decisions for message integrity checking, user authentication, time stamping, and message confidentiality. Moreover, we consider some ACL and firewall issues. This memo attempts to complement the IMPP design basis [Basis] by providing a discussion of privacy and security.</t>
