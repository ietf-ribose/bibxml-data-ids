      <t>This document specifies UMAC-AE, a shared-key algorithm that simultaneously encrypts data using a block cipher in counter mode while also authenticating the data with UMAC. At its peak rate, using AES as the block cipher, UMAC-AE encrypts and authenticates data at a cost of about 10% more than simple encryption. UMAC is unencumbered by intellectual property claims and can be used freely. Pairing UMAC with a license-free block cipher, such as AES, provides fast and license-free authenticated encryption.</t>
