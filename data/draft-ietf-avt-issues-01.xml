      <t>This memorandum is a companion document to the current version of the RTP protocol specification draft-ietf-avt-rtp-*.{txt,ps}. It discusses aspects of transporting real-time services (such as voice or video) over the Internet. It compares and evaluates design alternatives for a real-time transport protocol, providing rationales for the design decisions made for RTP. Also covered are issues of port assignment and multicast address allocation. A comprehensive glossary of terms related to multimedia conferencing is provided. This document is a product of the Audio-Video Transport working group within the Internet Engineering Task Force. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the working group's mailing list at rem-conf@es.net and/or the author(s).</t>
