      <t>This document proposes a dynamic trust security architecture based on Distributed Micro Service Communication (DMSC) to address the security risks in the communication of microservices. The DMSC architecture, by leveraging content semantic routing and decentralized control, transforms the traditional host-centric communication mode into a service-centric paradigm. Although DMSC enhances scalability and flexibility, its distributed nature introduces risks. To cope with these risks, it is necessary to consider security solutions for distributed large-scale microservice communication and ensure the security of services while minimizing the impact on the communication architecture.</t>
