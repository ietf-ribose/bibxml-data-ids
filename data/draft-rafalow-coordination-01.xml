      <t>The Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) [1] is a membership-based standards organization with technology for, and expertise in, modeling systems and network-related management information. In the interests of promoting a common set of standards, from time to time the IETF and the DMTF have found and may continue to find opportunities to work together in developing overlapping standards.</t>
