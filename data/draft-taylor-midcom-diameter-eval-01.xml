      <t>This document is submitted as part of the Midcom protocol selection process. It evaluates the suitability of the Diameter protocol as a transport for Midcom. The general conclusions are: . the Diameter architecture may be too heavy for the Midcom application, although this is a matter for discussion. It is clear in any event that much of the Diameter base is not needed; . a new application extension to Diameter would have to be defined to meet Midcom's requirements; . with these reservations, the protocol is a good fit to Midcom requirements. This version contains added details describing how to use Diameter to meet the requirements.</t>
