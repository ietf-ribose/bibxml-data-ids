      <t>The security enhancement is one of the most important enhancements to IP multicast. IP multicast requires many security functions that include user authentication of IP multicast, encryption of IP multicast datagrams and key management protocols for IP multicast. Among them, the user authentication function for IP multicast is considered one of the most important security functions for IP multicast. This document describes the extension to IGMP, version 2 (IGMPv2) [1] for the authentication of IP multicast senders and receivers, which prevents an unauthorized user from sending and receiving IP multicast datagrams.</t>
