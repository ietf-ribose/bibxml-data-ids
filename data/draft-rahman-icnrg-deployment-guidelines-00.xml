      <t>This document provides technical deployment guidelines for the ICN community. First, the possible deployment configurations for ICN are described including overlay and underlay approaches. Then proposed deployment migration paths for these configurations are outlined to address the major issues facing ICN such as application migration, and core and edge network migration. Next, selected ICN trial experiences are summarized. Finally, recommendations are given for protocol areas that require further standardization to facilitate future ICN interoperable deployments.</t>
