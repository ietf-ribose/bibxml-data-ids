    <abstract>
      <t>This memo documents a feature that significantly decreases the initial LSDB synchronization time in Broadcast Multiple Access (BMA) environments. This implementation only requires a single OSPF speaker per psuedo-node to support this functionality. These changes are implicitly supported within the OSPFv2 protocol. This memo is not intended to serve as a model for any other implementation.</t>
