      <t>To determine which domain is allowed to claim ownership of a certaintelephone number is difficult. This may cause problems when toauthenticate endpoints that use telephone number URIs and domainnames in their From address. This document investigates a proposalthat stores a public key below the corresponding ENUM tree in theDNS. The verifier can determine ownership by performing an ENUMlookup to retrieve the public key from the DNS and to use it forverifying the signature created as part of the SIP Identitymechanism.This document is a contribution to the ongoing discussion on RFC 4474when used in combination with E.164 numbers.</t>
