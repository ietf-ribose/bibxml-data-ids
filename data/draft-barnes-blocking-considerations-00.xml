      <t>The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium. This openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but it can allow bad communications as well as good. Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms to limit the extent and impact of abusive or illegal communications. Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on "blocking", the active prevention of abusive or illegal communications. This document examines several technical approaches to Internet service blocking in terms of their fit with the overall Internet architecture. In general, the approach to service blocking that is most coherent with the Internet architecture is to inform endpoints about bad services, so that the communicants can avoid engaging in abusive or illegal communications.</t>
