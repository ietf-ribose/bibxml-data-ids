      <t>This document explores how existing IETF YANG models, specifically the Attachment Circuit (AC) and Traffic Engineering (TE) topology models, can be applied to support a representative Neotec use case involving dynamic AI model placement at Edge Cloud sites. The use case, derived from China Telecom's Neotec side meeting at IETF 122, involves selecting optimal Edge locations for real-time AI inference based on end-to-end network performance between street-level cameras and Edge Cloud compute nodes. By mapping the use case across multiple network segments and applying relevant YANG models to query bandwidth, latency, and reliability, this document serves as a practical exercise to evaluate model suitability and identify potential gaps. The goal is to inform future work under the proposed Neotec Working Group.</t>
