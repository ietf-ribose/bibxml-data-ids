      <t>This document is a product of the Delay Tolerant Networking ResearchGroup and has been reviewed by that group. No objections to itspublication as an RFC were raised.This document defines PRoPHET, a Probabilistic Routing Protocol usingHistory of Encounters and Transitivity. PRoPHET is a variant of theepidemic routing protocol for intermittently connected networks thatoperates by pruning the epidemic distribution tree to minimizeresource usage while still attempting to achieve the best caserouting capabilities of epidemic routing. It is intended for use insparse mesh networks where there is no guarantee that a fullyconnected path between source and destination exists at any time,rendering traditional routing protocols unable to deliver messagesbetween hosts. These networks are examples of networks where thereis a disparity between the latency requirements of applications andthe capabilities of the underlying network (networks often referredto as Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant). The document presents anarchitectural overview followed by the protocol specification.</t>
