    <abstract>
      <t>This specification defined MoqTransport (moqt), an unified media delivery protocol over QUIC. It aims at supporting multiple application classes with varying latency requirements including ultra low latency applications such as interactive communication and gaming. It is based on a publish/subscribe metaphor where entities publish and subscribe to data that is sent through, and received from, relays in the cloud. The data is delivered in the strict priority order. The information subscribed to is named such that this forms an overlay information centric network. The relays allow for efficient large scale deployments.</t>
