      <t>This document attempts to discuss some of the definitions required toundertake the specifications of such benchmarks, and also to discusssome of the possible ways to benchmark a routing protocol performancewithin a network, and some of the implications of those benchmarks.The definition of convergence is discussed first, then pollingnetwork devices. Several tests which are commonly used to measurenetwork convergence are examined.This draft does not attempt to define what techniques should be usedto benchmark network convergence, but only to provide considerationsthat testers shoudl consider when attempting to measure netowrkconvergence using various methods.</t>
