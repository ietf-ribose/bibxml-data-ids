    <abstract>
      <t>This document attempts to discuss some of the definitions required to undertake the specifications of such benchmarks, and also to discuss some of the possible ways to benchmark a routing protocol performance within a network, and some of the implications of those benchmarks. The definition of convergence is discussed first, then polling network devices. Several tests which are commonly used to measure network convergence are examined. This draft does not attempt to define what techniques should be used to benchmark network convergence, but only to provide considerations that testers shoudl consider when attempting to measure netowrk convergence using various methods.</t>
