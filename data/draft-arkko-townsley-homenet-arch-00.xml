      <t>This memo focuses on the evolving networking technology within and among relatively small "residential home" networks. The goal of this memo is to define the architecture for IPv6-based home networking that supports the demands placed on it. This architecture shows how standard IPv6 mechanisms and addressing can be employed in home networking, and outlines the need for specific protocol extensions for certain additional functionality.</t>
