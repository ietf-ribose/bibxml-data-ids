      <t>This memo includes a list of manageable parameters for RSVP and SBM implementations. These are in addition to those already described in RFC 2206 and RFC 2213. Specifically, it describes parameters for control of the base signaling protocols themselves, as well as a basic set of parameters for control of policy decisions by a Local Policy Module. These are not intended to be exhaustive lists but they have been identified as useful for practical implementations.</t>
