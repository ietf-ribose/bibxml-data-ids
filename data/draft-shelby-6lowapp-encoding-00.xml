      <t>For the resource constrained devices and networks of 6LowApp it isessential that the payload of messages are compact. The use of XMLto represent data in web applications has become almost universal.The interoperability of 6LowApp with these applications will requirethat XML can also be carried over the embedded web. This documentintroduces and compares techniques for encoding or compressing XMLfor use with 6LowApp including EXI, BXML and Fast Infoset. Theperformance and requirements for using these encodings are analyzedin the scope of 6LowApp. It is shown that these standard encodingscan represent XML in a compact form, with reasonable overhead, andrequire only Internet media type and content transfer encodingindication from the application protocol.</t>
