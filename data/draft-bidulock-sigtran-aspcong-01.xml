      <t>This memo describes ASP Congestion (ASPCONG) that provides the ability for an Application Server Process (ASP) to indicate congestion to a Signalling Gateway (SG) for the SS7 Signalling User Adaptation Layers [M2UA], [M3UA], [SUA], [ISUA], [TUA]. Extension parameters and procedures are added by this memo in extension to those of the User Adaptation layers to provide for ASP congestion.</t>
