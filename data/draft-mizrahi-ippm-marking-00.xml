      <t>This memo presents a summary of marking methods for performance measurements, and discusses the tradeoffs among them. These marking methods enable to measure various performance metrics such as packet loss and delay, and require a low overhead in the header of data packets, as low as one or two bits per packet, or in some cases even zero bits per packet. The target audience of this document is network protocol designers; this document is intended to help protocol designers choose the best marking method(s) based on the protocol's constraints and requirements.</t>
