    <abstract>
      <t>In CDNI deployment, URL signing mechanism should continue to function for content access restriction. Previous CDNI documents have described the basic of URL signing. However, in some cases that the key cannot be distributed from the Authoritative CDN to the Delivering CDN, the URL validation requirement cannot be fulfilled. This document gives some supplementary description concerning URL signing and validation mechanism in case of DNS based Request Routing, and as a result, a compliment for authorization object in metadata interface is presented.</t>
