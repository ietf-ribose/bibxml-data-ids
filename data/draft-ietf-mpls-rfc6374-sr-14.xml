    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the application of the MPLS loss and delay measurement techniques, originally defined in RFC 6374, RFC 7876, and RFC 9341 within Segment Routing (SR) networks that utilize the MPLS data plane. Segment Routing enables the forwarding of packets through an ordered list of instructions, known as segments, which are imposed at the ingress node. By applying the mechanisms from RFC 6374, RFC 7876, and RFC 9341 to SR-MPLS networks, this document facilitates accurate measurement of packet loss and delay for Segment Routing paths. It defines the procedures and extensions necessary to perform performance measurement and fault management in SR-MPLS environments, ensuring that network operators can effectively measure and maintain the quality of service across their SR-based MPLS networks. This includes coverage of links and end-to-end SR-MPLS paths, as well as SR Policies.</t>
