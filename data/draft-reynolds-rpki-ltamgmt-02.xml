      <t>This document describes a facility to enable a relying party (RP) tomanage trust anchors (TAs) in the context of the Resource Public KeyInfrastructure (RPKI). It is common to allow an RP to import TAmaterial in the form of self-signed certificates. The facilitydescribed in this document allows an RP to impose constraints on suchTAs. Because this mechanism is designed to operate in the RPKIcontext, the relevant constraints are the RFC 3779 extensions thatbind address spaces and/or autonomous system (AS) numbers toentities. The primary motivation for this facility is to enable an RPto ensure that resource allocation information that it has acquiredvia some trusted channel is not overridden by the informationacquired from the RPKI repository system or by the putative TAs thatthe RP imports. Specifically, the mechanism allows an RP to specify aset of bindings between public key identifiers and RFC 3779 extensiondata and will override any conflicting bindings expressed via theputative TAs and the certificates downloaded from the RPKI repositorysystem. Although this mechanism is designed for local use by an RP,an entity that is accorded administrative control over a set of RPsmay use this mechanism to convey its view of the RPKI to a set of RPswithin its jurisdiction. The means by which this latter use case iseffected is outside the scope of this document.</t>
