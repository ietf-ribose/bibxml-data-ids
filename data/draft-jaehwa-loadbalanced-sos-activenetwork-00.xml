      <t>Secure overlay services (SOS) architecture has been proposed to provide reliable communication between clients and a target underDDoS attacks. The SOS architecture employs a set of overlay nodesarranged in three hierarchical layers that controls access to thetarget. Although the architecture is novel and works well under simple congestion based attacks, we observe that it is flimsy afterit resisted the DDoS for a period of time and it didn't pay attention to the endurance of the Nodes. We propose an Algorithm toimprove the secure overlay services (SOS) both on load balance and resilient.</t>
