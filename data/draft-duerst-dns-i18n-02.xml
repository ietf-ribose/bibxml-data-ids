      <t>Internet domain names are currently limited to a very restricted character set. This document proposes the introduction of a new 'zero-level' domain (ZLD) to allow the use of arbitrary characters from the Universal Character Set (ISO 10646/Unicode) in domain names. The proposal is fully backwards compatible and does not need any changes to DNS. Version 02 is reissued without changes just to keep this draft available.</t>
