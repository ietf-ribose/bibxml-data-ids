      <t>This document describes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that enables proxies to distribute call state to user agents. The state information can be returned to the proxy when the user agent requests a change in the characteristics of the active call. By providing the ability to distribute state to the user agents where it can be securely stored, proxy servers can remain stateless for the duration of the call. This mechanism allows a proxy server to provide services that depend on call state, while still being stateless.</t>
