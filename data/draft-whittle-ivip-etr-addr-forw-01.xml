      <t>ETR Address Forwarding (EAF) is a novel method by which an IPv4 Core-Edge Separation solution to the Internet's routing scaling problemcan tunnel packets from an ITR to an ETR. EAF involves using 31 bitsof the IPv4 header for new purposes: bit 48, the More Fragments flag,the Fragment Offset field and the Header Checksum field - to carry a30 bit ETR address. Consequently, packets in this format need to behandled by routers with upgraded functionality. EAF is analternative to encapsulation and has advantages including: simplerITRs and ETRs, direct support for conventional RFC 1191 PMTUD, noencapsulation overhead and full compatibility with IPsec AH andTraceroute. This I-D also briefly explores an alternative to thisapproach: a new header, of the same length and different, with adifferent 4 bit Version, to carry 31 bits of ETR address.</t>
