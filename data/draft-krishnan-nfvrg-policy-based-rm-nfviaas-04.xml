      <t>One of the goals of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) is to offer the NFV infrastructure as a service to other SP customers - this is called NFVIaaS. Virtual Network Function (VNF) deployment in this paradigm will drive support for unique placement policies, given VNF's stringent service level specifications (SLS) required by customer SPs. Additionally, NFV DCs often have capacity, energy and other constraints - thus, optimizing the overall resource usage based on policy is an important part of the overall solution. The purpose of this document is to depict an architectural framework for policy based resource placement and scheduling in the context of NFVIaaS.</t>
