      <t>To limit the privacy and security issues created by the association between a device, its traffic, its location and its user, client vendors have started implementing MAC address rotation. When such rotation happens, some in-network states may break, which may affect network efficiency and the user experience. At the same time, devices may continue sending other stable identifiers, defeating the MAC rotation purposes. This document lists various network environments and a set of functional network services that may be affected by such rotation. This document then examines settings where the user experience may be affected by in-network state disruption, and settings where other machine identifiers may help re- identify the user or recover the identity of the user, and locate the device and its associated user. Last, this document examines solutions to maintain user privacy while preserving user quality of experience and network operation efficiency.</t>
