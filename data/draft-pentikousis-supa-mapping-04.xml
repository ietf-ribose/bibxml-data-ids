      <t>Nowadays, the underlying network infrastructure grows in scale and complexity, which make it challenging for network operators to manage and configure the network. Deploying policy or configuration based on an abstract view of the underlying network is much better than manipulating each individual network element, however, in this case, the policy and configuration cannot be recognized by the network elements. This document describes guidelines for mapping said abstract configuration and policy into device-level configuration and the way in which such models will be processed by software to produce configuration details for actual devices. The Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) framework overview and primary procedures of mapping are described. Moreover, an exemplary mapping scenario is provided to illustrate the defined mechanism.</t>
