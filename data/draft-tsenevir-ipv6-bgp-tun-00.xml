      <t>In this document we provide methods to discover and connect native IPV6 clouds that are separated by IPV4 Internet. BGP-MP [2] is used as protocol to discover IPV6 relay routers. BGP-MP(BGP4+) [3] is used to distribute IPV6 routes. Encapsulation of IPV6 presented in [4] is used to tunnel IPv6 traffic across IPV4 Internet. The method presented here is known as 6in4 as opposed to 6to4 [4] or 6over4[5].</t>
