      <t>The Shim6 protocol provides for locator agility while satisfying the'first, do no harm' security requirements. This document outlinesthree rather orthogonal sets of extensions to Shim6. The first oneis how to procide complete separation between identifiers andlocators. The second one is how to allow routers to rewrite thelocators in the shim6 packets as a way to provide traffic engineeringinformation to the hosts. The third one is the outline of a simpleextension to allow shim6, with a CGA upper-layer ID, to operate usingIPv4 addresses as locators.The purpose of this outline is to stimulate discussions.</t>
