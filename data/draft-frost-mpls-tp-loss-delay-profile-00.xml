      <t>Procedures for the measurement of packet loss, delay, and throughputin MPLS networks are defined in RFC XXXX. This document describes aprofile, i.e. a simplified subset, of these procedures that sufficesto meet the specific requirements of MPLS-based transport networks.This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunication Union TelecommunicationStandardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS TransportProfile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge(PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalitiesof a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T.[RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC andinsert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the publishedRFC has IETF consensus.]</t>
