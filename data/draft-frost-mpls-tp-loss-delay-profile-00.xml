      <t>Procedures for the measurement of packet loss, delay, and throughput in MPLS networks are defined in RFC XXXX. This document describes a profile, i.e. a simplified subset, of these procedures that suffices to meet the specific requirements of MPLS-based transport networks. This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and Pseudowire Emulation Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network as defined by the ITU-T. [RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC and insert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the published RFC has IETF consensus.]</t>
