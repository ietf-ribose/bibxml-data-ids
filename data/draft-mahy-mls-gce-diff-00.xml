    <abstract>
      <t>The Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol allows the members of the group to agree on a set of GroupContext extensions. MLS includes a mechanism to do a wholesale replacements of all GroupContext extensions, but not to modify individual extensions. In this document, we define a mechanism that allows implementations to add, update, and remove each element of the GroupContext individually. This also makes it practical for applications using MLS to exploit this feature of MLS to ensure that the group members are in agreement on the state of the application in addition to MLS-related state.</t>
