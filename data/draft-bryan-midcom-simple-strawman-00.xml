      <t>This is a very simple strawman protocol for agents to request NAT address translations and firewall pinholes from a middlebox. This protocol uses the underlying transport for reliability and to avoid reinventing TCP. This protocol does not use an existing protocol like COPS, SOAP, HTTP or DIAMETER as these protocols include significant complexity that is not required to solve the middlebox problem.</t>
