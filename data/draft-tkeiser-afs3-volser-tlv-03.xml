      <t>AFS-3 is a distributed file system based upon prototypes developed atCarnegie Mellon University during the 1980s. AFS-3 heavily leveragesRemote Procedure Calls (RPCs) as the foundation for its distributedarchitecture. In 2003, new RPCs were introduced into AFS-3 thatprovide for capability introspection between file servers and cachemanagers. This memo introduces equivalent functionality to thevolume server RPC interface, thus making the volume managementinterface more extensible.Furthermore, this memo extends the volume management interface tosupport getting and setting of AFS volume attributes via anextensible Tag-Length-Value (TLV) encoding, which is based upon XDRdiscriminated unions. TLV-based get and set RPCs are specified,along with a tag enumeration RPC. The TLV encoding side-steps thetypical XDR union decode problem, whereby failure to decode a unionleg causes the entire RPC payload decode to fail, by mandating an XDRopaque default leg for the union, along with a standard mechanism forencoding new leg types inside the XDR opaque blob.Finally, tags are allocated for existing volume and transactionmetadata, and implementation-private tags are allocated for metadatarelated to the OpenAFS Demand Attach File Server and RxOSD protocol.Internet Draft CommentsComments regarding this draft are solicited.
