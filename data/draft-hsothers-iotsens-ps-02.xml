    <abstract>
      <t>The document attempts to establish the need for new authentication methods in the Internet of Things (IoT) as a future networking area beyond 5G going into 6G for standardization. Several scenarios are described where the current authentication protocols do not work or are insufficient. Wireless LAN/6G sensing is established as an admission method that can be used within the framework of Device Provisioning Protocol and LED light and others as out-of band channel based authentication which can be further explored.</t>
