    <abstract>
      <t>One of the requirements of the MPLS transport profile [RFC5654] is to provide linear protection for transport paths, which include both LSPs and PWs. The functional architecture described in [SurvivFwk] is applicable to both LSP and PWs, however [LinearProt] does not explicitly describe mechanisms for PW protection in MPLS-TP. This document extends the applicability of the linear protection mechanism described in [LinearProt] to MPLS-TP segmented PWs as defined in [RFC6073].</t>
