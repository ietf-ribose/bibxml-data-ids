      <t>As part of the Internet Multimedia Conferencing Architecture [3], conference course control deals with the control of running conferences after the creation of the initial conference state with respect to the membership and access control during runtime of the session. The spectrum of scenarios reaches from small multiparty gatherings up to large scaled meetings with a high fluctuation of userâ€™s membership and activity.
