      <t>Peer-to-peer applications, such as file sharing, real-timecommunication, and live media streaming, use a significant amount ofInternet resources. Such applications often transfer large amountsof data in direct peer-to-peer connections. However, they usuallyhave little knowledge of the underlying network topology. As aresult, they may choose their peers based on measurements andstatistics that, in many situations, may lead to suboptimal choices.This document describes problems related to optimizing trafficgenerated by peer-to-peer applications and associated issues suchoptimizations raise in the use of network-layer information.</t>
