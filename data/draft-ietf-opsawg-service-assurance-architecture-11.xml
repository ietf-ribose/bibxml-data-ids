    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an architecture that aims at assuring that service instances are running as expected. As services rely upon multiple sub-services provided by a variety of elements including the underlying network devices and functions, getting the assurance of a healthy service is only possible with a holistic view of all involved elements. This architecture not only helps to correlate the service degradation with symptoms of a specific network component but also to list the services impacted by the failure or degradation of a specific network component.</t>
