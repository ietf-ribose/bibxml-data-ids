      <t>This memo specifies the details of the Session Security Envelope (SSE). SSE is a session protocol aiming to guarantee confidentiality, integrity and authentication completely independently by the underlying context, namely network and transport layers. A single session using the SEE protocol can include a single transport session or multiple transport sessions. This mean that SSE can survive the break-down in network and transport layers or to attacks carried against them. SSE is also applicable in networks lacking in classic inter-networking and transport protocols SSE relies on modern AEAD block cipher modes of operations, a class of block cipher modes which allows, at the same time, to authenticate the message while encrypting a part of it.</t>
