    <abstract>
      <t>From a viewpoint of a layer architecture, a network layer should feature a mobility support. Then the users can enjoy their mobility whatever data-link devices and user applications they use. Mobile IP has been proposed for a solution to provide IP-layer handoffs between subnets served by different Foreign Agents. However, it still suffers an interruption of the communications for real-time applications.</t>
