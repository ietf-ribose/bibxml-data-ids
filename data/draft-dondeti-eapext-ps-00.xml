      <t>The extensible authentication protocol (EAP), specified in RFC3748[1] is a generic framework supporting multiple authenticationmethods. The EAP keying hierarchy specified in [2] has two top levelkeys: a master session key (MSK) and an extended MSK (EMSK). The MSKis used for access control enforcement, whereas the purpose of EMSKis to be defined. Several proposals for the use of the EMSK havebeen made, among them are support for efficient re-authentication ofthe EAP peer as it moves from one authenticator to another,bootstrapping preshared keys, visited domain key management. In thisdocument, we explore the various proposed uses of the EMSK keyhierarchy and the design considerations in specifying the EMSK keyhierarchy.</t>
