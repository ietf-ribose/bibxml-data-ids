      <t>The WebSocket protocol specifies that all frames sent from the client to the server must be masked. This was introduced as a protection against a possible attack on the infrastructure. With careful consideration, the masking could be omitted when intermediaries do not have access to the unencrypted traffic. This specification introduces a WebSocket extension that disables the mandatory masking of frames sent from the client to the server. The extension is allowed only if the client uses an encrypted connection.</t>
