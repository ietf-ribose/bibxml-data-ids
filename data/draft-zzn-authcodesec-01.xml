      <t>This document specifies a mechanism to enhance domain transfer security by transitioning from a shared-secret authorization model to a asymmetric cryptographic signature-based validation system. Using asymmetric cryptographic signatures enables many benefits over a shared secret, such as non-repudiation, improved auditability through clear identification of the authorizing entity, elimination of the need for registries to store and secure shared secrets, replay protection through timestamp validation, and reduced risk of interception since only the private key needs to remain secret. This document establishes the following AuthCodeSEC extension of EPP with the following protocol elements:</t>
