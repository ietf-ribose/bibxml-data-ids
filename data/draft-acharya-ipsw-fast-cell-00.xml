      <t>This document describes a method for mapping IP flows to ATM switches. No signaling is necessary to setup a path through ATM switches. Switch controllers run a IP routing protocol and execute IP forwarding. The Ipsofacto component is responsible for mapping a IP flow to a switched path. The focus of this document is primarily on switching IP multicast. Mechanisms for switching unicast flows are also described.</t>
