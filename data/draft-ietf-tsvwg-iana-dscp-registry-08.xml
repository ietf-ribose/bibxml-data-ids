      <t>The Differentiated Services (Diffserv) architecture specifies use of the DS field in the IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers to carry one of 64 distinct differentiated services field codepoint (DSCP) values. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains a registry of assigned DSCP values. This update to RFC 2474 changes the IANA registration policy for Pool 3 of the registry (i.e., DSCP values of the form xxxx01) to Standards Action, i.e., values are assigned through a Standards Track or Best Current Practice RFC. The update also removes permission for experimental and local use of the codepoints that form Pool 3 of the DSCP registry; Pool 2 Codepoints (i.e., DSCP values of the form xxxx11) remain available for these purposes.</t>
