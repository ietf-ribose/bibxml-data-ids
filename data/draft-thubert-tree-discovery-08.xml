      <t>This paper describes a simple distance vector protocol that exposesonly a default route towards the infrastructure in a nested NEMOconfiguration. The draft extends the Neighbor Discovery Protocol[RFC4861] in order to carry information and metrics which will help aMobile Router select its Attachment Router(s) in an autonomousfashion and provides generic rules which guarantee that theinteraction of different selection processes will not create loops.</t>
