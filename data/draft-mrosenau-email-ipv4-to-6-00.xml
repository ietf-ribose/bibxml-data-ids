    <abstract>
      <t>During the introduction phase of IPv6 (as of Jan 2013) many existing mail servers are not able to do IPv6 communication, yet. However new networks will be assigned IPv6 addresses only so new mail servers will not be able to do IPv4 communication. This document proposes the installation of special servers that are able to route mail between IPv4-only and IPv6-only mail servers to solve this problem.</t>
