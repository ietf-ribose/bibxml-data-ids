      <t>In IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), randomizing the interface identifier (IID) is a common practice to promote privacy. If there are a very large number of nodes, as has been discussed in several use cases, the effect will to proportionately increase the number of IIDs. A duplicate address detection (DAD) cycle is needed for each configured IID, introducing more and more overhead into the network. Each failed DAD requires the initiating node to regenerate a new IID and undergo the DAD cycle again. This document proposes an optimized approach when higher privacy is required by given network by allowing 6LBR (6LoWPAN Border Router) to provide a unique IID, avoiding the potential duplication. Such practice also prevent probable failure of time-critical application by enabling 6LBR to suggest unique IID, in case of address collision. Additionally, further optimizations are suggested to enable multiple concurrent DAD cycles and to return the suggested IID from 6LBR to 6LN in a space-efficient manner.</t>
