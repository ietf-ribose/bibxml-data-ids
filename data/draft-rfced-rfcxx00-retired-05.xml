    <abstract>
      <t>At one time, the RFC Editor published snapshots of the "Internet Official Protocol Standards". These documents were known as xx00 documents, the last of which was published in May 2008. These snapshots have been replaced by an online database. The RFC Editor provides an up-to-date list on the RFC Editor website and will no longer be publishing these snapshots as RFCs.</t>
