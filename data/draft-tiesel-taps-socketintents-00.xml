      <t>This document outlines an API-independent concept that allows applications to share their knowledge about upcoming communication and express their performance preferences in a portable and abstract way: Socket Intents. Socket Intents express what an application knows, assumes, expects or wants to prioritize regarding its own network communication. The information provided by Socket Intents should be taken into account by the network stack in a best-effort way. Socket Intent can be used to stem against the complexity and make use of multiple provisioning domains as well as new transport protocols and features available to a larger user base by expressing the applications intents in an abstract and portable way.</t>
