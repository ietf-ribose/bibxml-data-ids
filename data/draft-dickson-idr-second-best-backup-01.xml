      <t>This Internet Draft describes an enhanced way to exchange prefixinformation, to permit multiple copies of a prefix with differentpaths to be announced and withdrawn.This negotiated capability provides faster local (inter-AS) andglobal (intra-AS) convergence, reduces path-hunting, improves route-reflector behaviour, including eliminating both persistentoscillations and BGP "wedgies".Additional prefix instances have new optional BGP attributes, tocontrol path selection.Withdrawl of prefixes will require new attributes to disambiguateprefix instances.Benefits are seen both when deployed intra-AS, and on inter-ASpeering.Author's NoteThis Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft or a relateddraft(s) being placed on the Standards Track for idr.The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in [5].</t>
