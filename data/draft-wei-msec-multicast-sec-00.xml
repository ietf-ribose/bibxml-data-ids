      <t>Multicast security algorithm based on agent node can select the groupnode corresponding to the smallest path cost to be the agent node,and multicast in accordance with the optimal multicast routing. Inaddition, the multicast source node uses the key different from thegroup key to encrypt multicast data to meet the requirements ofmulticast security. The agent nodes can be different for differentmulticast sources, which can spread the burden of the agent node andavoid the excessive burden problem when the same node as the agentnode of different sources.</t>
