      <t>This document describes a framework and requirements for theinteraction between users and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) basedapplications. By interacting with applications, users can guide theway in which they operate. The focus of this framework is stimulussignaling, which allows a user agent to interact with an applicationwithout knowledge of the semantics of that application. Stimulussignaling can occur to a user interface running locally with theclient, or to a remote user interface, through media streams.Stimulus signaling encompasses a wide range of mechanisms, rangingfrom clicking on hyperlinks, to pressing buttons, to traditional DualTone Multi Frequency (DTMF) input. In all cases, stimulus signalingis supported through the use of markup languages, which play a keyrole in this framework.</t>
