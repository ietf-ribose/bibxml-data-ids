      <t>This memo defines a framework for authorization in constrained-node networks, i.e. networks where some devices have severe constraints on memory, processing, power and communication bandwidth. The main goal is to offload constrained devices by providing them access control support from trusted parties that are less constrained. The approach is based on RESTful requests to dedicated access management resources, supporting different authorization schemes and communication security paradigms.</t>
