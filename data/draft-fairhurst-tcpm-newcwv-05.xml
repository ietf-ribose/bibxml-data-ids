    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes an update to RFC 5681 to address issues that arise when TCP is used to support traffic that exhibits periods where the sending rate is limited by the application rather than the congestion window. It updates TCP to allow a TCP sender to restart quickly following either an idle or rate-limited interval. This method is expected to benefit applications that send rate-limited traffic using TCP, while also providing an appropriate response if congestion is experienced. It also evaluates TCP Congestion Window Validation, CWV, an IETF experimental specification defined in RFC 2861, and concludes that CWV sought to address important issues, but failed to deliver a widely used solution. This document therefore proposes an update to the status of RFC 2861 by recommending it is moved from Experimental to Historic status, and that it is replaced by the current specification.</t>
