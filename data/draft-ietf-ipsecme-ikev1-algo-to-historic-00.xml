    <abstract>
      <t>Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) is deprecated. Accordingly, IKEv1 has been moved to Historic status. A number of old algorithms that are associated with IKEv1, and not widely implemented for IKEv2 are deprecated as well. This document adds a Status column to the IANA IKEv2 Transform Type registries.</t>
