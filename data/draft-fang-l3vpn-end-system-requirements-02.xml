      <t>The proven scalability and extensibility beyond the original design purposes of the BGP/MPLS IP VPNs (IP VPN) technology [RFC4364] has made it an attractive candidate for Data Center (DC)/Cloud virtualization. This document provides the requirements for extending IP VPN (in original or modified versions) into the end-systems/end- devices, such as a server in a DCs/Cloud. Physical separation of the control and the forwarding planes; virtualizing the network functions of the IP VPN network elements, such as a PE, are the key differences compared with the classic IP VPN solutions.</t>
