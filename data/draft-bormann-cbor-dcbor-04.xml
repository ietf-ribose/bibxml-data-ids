      <t>CBOR (STD 94, RFC 8949) defines "Deterministically Encoded CBOR" in its Section 4.2, providing some flexibility for application specific decisions. The CBOR Common Deterministic Encoding (CDE) Profile provides a more detail common base for Deterministic Encoding, facilitating it be offered as a selectable feature of generic encoders, as well as the concept of Application Profiles that are layered on top of CDE. This document defines the application profile "dCBOR" as an example of such an application profile.</t>
