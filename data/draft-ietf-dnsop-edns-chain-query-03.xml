      <t>This document defines an EDNS0 extension that can be used by a security-aware validating Resolver configured as a Forwarder to send a single query, requesting a complete validation path along with the regular query answer. The reduction in queries lowers the latency. This extension requries the use of source IP verified transport such as TCP or UDP with DNS-COOKIES so it cannot be abused in amplification attacks.</t>
