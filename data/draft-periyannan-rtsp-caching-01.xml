    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents the issues facing streaming media caching. It proposes a set of mechanisms to enable streaming media caching between standards-based RTSP/RTP servers and proxies. Streaming media caching refers to the process through which streaming content is dynamically replicated closer to users so as to provide a better viewing experience. A list of RTSP enhancements and open issues are presented. This document is intended to be a starting point for discussion between various parties interested in standardizing the mechanism used by RTSP/RTP servers to enable streaming media caching.</t>
