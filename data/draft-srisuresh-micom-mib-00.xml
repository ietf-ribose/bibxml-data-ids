      <t>Middlebox communication (midcom) was conceived to move application level gateway (ALG) intelligence out of middleboxes into application specific midcom agents. Midcom agents will be assumed to use midcom to control middlebox resources so as to permit applications to traverse a middlebox. The scope of the middleboxes is limited to NAT and firewall devices. This document defines SNMP managed midcom objects to control middleboxresources and justifies adapting SNMPv3 as the midcom protocol.</t>
