      <t>This memo provides a mechanism for mobile IPv6 nodes to use standard [IPSEC] mechanisms (both [AH] and [ESP]) to authenticate and authorize mobile IP route optmization messages which provide strong crypotographic authentication as well as protection from man in the middle attacks. This protection can be used both between home agents, and correspondent nodes.</t>
