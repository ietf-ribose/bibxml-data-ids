      <t>The Content-Disposition [CDISP] header defines two disposition types: ``inline'' and ``attachment'' which can affect presentation of a MIME [MIME-IMB] body part. There have been a number of cases where one MIME body part is ancillary or contains meta-data for another MIME body part and is neither suitable for inline display by itself, nor is it useful if treated as an independent attachment and saved to a file by itself. If the recipient UA is not familiar with the specific media type, the user often is presented with a useless unrecognizable attachment. This memo proposes a third disposition type, ``ancillary'', to address this situation.</t>
