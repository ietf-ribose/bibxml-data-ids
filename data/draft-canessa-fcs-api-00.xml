      <t>During the past twelve months there has been interest in Fixed Content Storage servers. Vendors have been introducing offerings that use proprietary API calls. This is causing delay in acceptance. By using a set of standard API calls software developers, vendors and end-users would benefit. This document provides background on the need for an API. It defines a simple and reduced yet robust set of Application Programming Interface (API) calls to be supported by implementations of FCS servers. Store, query and retrieve operations are described in detail. The concept, description and format of a Global Unique Identifier (GUID) are provided. A GUID serves as a unique handle to each object stored by a FCS server. The list of the set of API calls is defined. A basic set of data structures and support functions is presented.</t>
