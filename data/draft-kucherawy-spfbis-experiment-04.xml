      <t>In 2006 the IETF published a suite of protocol documents comprising SPF and Sender-ID, two proposed email authentication protocols. Because of interoperability concerns created by simultaneous use of the two protocols by a receiver, and some concerns with Sender-ID and compatibility with existing standards, the IESG required them to have Experimental status and invited the community to observe their deployments for a period of time, hoping convergence would be possible later. After six years, sufficient experience and evidence have been collected that the experiment thus created can be considered concluded, and a single protocol can be advanced. This memo presents those findings.</t>
