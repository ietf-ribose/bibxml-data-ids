      <t>This specification defines a new Mobile IPv4 extension which is usedto negotiate the Multicast-Broadcast Encapsulation Delivery style inthe case of Mobile IPv4 Foreign Agent Care-of Address moderegistration. This mechanism allows the mobile node to negotiatewhich type of traffic to be delivered encapsulated to the foreignagent while delivering other types of IP packets using directdelivery style. In particular, this mechanism gives the flexibilityto eliminate tunnel overhead in the (typically) wireless mediumbetween the mobile node and the foreign agent. In addition to thereduced overhead, the new mechanism makes many multicast andbroadcast services available to the mobile node in a much moredeterministic and efficient way.</t>
