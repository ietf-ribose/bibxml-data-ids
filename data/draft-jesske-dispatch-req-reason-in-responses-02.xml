      <t>Although the use of the Reason header field in responses isconsidered in RFC3326, doing so is not specified for any existingresponse code. Nonetheless, the Reason header field has been widelyused in responses to carry Q.850 reason codes for failure responsesto INVITEs that have been gatewayed to PSTN systems. This documentspecifies and formally permits the use of the Reason header field inSIP responses to carry Q.850 reason codes for this and otherpurposes.</t>
