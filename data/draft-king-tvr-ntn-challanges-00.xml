    <abstract>
      <t>Advanced networks, including the Internet, will utilise an increasing amount of Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) infrastructure. NTNs include Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) aviation, and High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS). In addition, NTN infrastructure will facilitate the deployment of advanced 5G use cases and services. NTNs infrastructure is typically mobile, with various links and nodes operating at different altitudes and latencies. Some NTN nodes and links are temporal and need to be scheduled and established at specific times based on line-of-sight availability, traffic demand and power budgets. This document summarises time variant NTN requirements and challenges not met by existing routing and traffic engineering techniques.</t>
