    <abstract>
      <t>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. Segment Routing (SR) can be used to steer packets through a network employing source routing. SR can be applied to both MPLS (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. Stateful PCEP extensions for SR allow a PCE to maintain state and to control and initiate SR Traffic Engineering (TE) LSPs. PCEP supports the grouping of two unidirectional MPLS-TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs), signaled via RSVP-TE, using association. This document defines PCEP extensions for grouping two unidirectional SR LSPs (one in each direction in a network) into a single associated bidirectional SR LSP. The mechanisms defined in this document are applicable to both stateless and stateful PCEs for PCE-initiated and PCC-initiated LSPs.</t>
