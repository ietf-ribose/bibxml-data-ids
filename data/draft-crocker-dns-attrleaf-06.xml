      <t>Historically, any DNS RR may occur for any domain name. Recent additions have defined DNS leaf nodes that contain a reserved node name, beginning with an underscore. The underscore construct is used to define a semantic scope for DNS records associated with the parent domain. This note explores the nature of this DNS usage and defines the "underscore names" registry with IANA.</t>
