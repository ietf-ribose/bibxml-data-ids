      <t>With the increasing deployment of Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs) and Route Origin Validation (ROV), the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) has become a critical component for securing inter-domain routing. RPKI leverages cryptographic certificates to validate the authenticity and authorization of IP address and AS number allocations. All RPKI objects are stored in distributed repositories and periodically retrieved by relying parties (RPs). This document presents a data-driven analysis of the current RPKI repository system, including a global survey of AS administrators and an empirical evaluation of repository operations. The analysis reveals that the existing repository architecture suffers from limited scalability and suboptimal efficiency, and is highly sensitive to failures. As the number of ROAs and RPs increases, the growing number of point-to-point connections between repositories and RPs, coupled with the pull-based data synchronization model, significantly degrades the system's scalability and performance. Moreover, a failure or attack on any Publication Point (PP) can prevent RPs from obtaining a complete and up-to-date view of RPKI data. This document further outlines the fundamental requirements for building a scalable, resilient,and efficient RPKI repository architecture to address these limitations.</t>
