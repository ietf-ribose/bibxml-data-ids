      <t>The Trusted Platform Module, for the past decade, has shown potentialto improve computer security. However, there is growing concerns thatthe Trusted Platform Module, and its related technologies might bechallenging for Forensic Investigators to acquire and analyze certaindigital evidence. For example, if the key evidence is encrypted, andcryptographically bound to a set of platform characteristics, thenthose characteristics must exist on the platform (that is being usedto decrypt the evidence) before the evidence can be decrypted.As a result, it is believed that if a suspect cryptographicallybound the evidence to the platform characteristics, and thosecharacteristics in some way got changed, then it might not bepossible to decrypt the potential evidence.For this reason, we explored how Trusted Platform Module and itsrelated technologies might support digital forensic analysis within a trusted enterprise network.</t>
