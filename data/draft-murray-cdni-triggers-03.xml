      <t>This document describes the part of the CDN Interconnect Control Interface that allows a CDN to trigger activity in an interconnected CDN that is configured to deliver content on its behalf. The upstream CDN can use this mechanism to request that the downstream CDN pre-positions metadata or content, or that it re-validate or purge metadata or content. The upstream CDN can monitor the status of activity that it has triggered in the downstream CDN.</t>
