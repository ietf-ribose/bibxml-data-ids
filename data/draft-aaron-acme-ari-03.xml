    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies how an ACME server may provide suggestions to ACME clients as to when they should attempt to renew their certificates. This allows servers to mitigate load spikes, and ensures clients do not make false assumptions about appropriate certificate renewal periods. Current Implementations Draft note: this section will be removed by the editor before final publication.
