    <abstract>
      <t>BGP flow specification version 1 (FSv1), defined in RFC 8955, RFC 8956, and RFC 9117 describes the distribution of traffic filter policy (traffic filters and actions) distributed via BGP. During the deployment of BGP FSv1 a number of issues were detected, so version 2 of the BGP flow specification (FSv2) protocol addresses these features. In order to provide a clear demarcation between FSv1 and FSv2, a different NLRI encapsulates FSv2. The IDR WG requires two implementation Implementers feedback on FSv2 was that FSv2 has a correct design, but that breaking FSv2 into a progression of documents would aid deployment of the draft. The IDR WG requires two implementation so This document is the first of the series of documents indicating the basic FSv2 with user ordering of filters added to FSv1 IP Filters and IP actions.</t>
