    <abstract>
      <t>The non-DF of a Single-Active Ethernet Segment (SA-ES) can filter both unicast traffic and BUM traffic. In such case, when a specific Single-Active ES performs fast DF recovery, the corresponding revertive FRR switching should be performed on the ingress PEs that are not adjacent to this ES. This revertive FRR switching needs to be performed immediately after the A-D per EVI route with the "P=1" is received from the new DF node. In other words, the revertive FRR switching cannot perform the WTR procedures, otherwise unicast traffic will be dropped on the new NDF node during the WTR. In this draft, the SCT-EC is extended to the A-D per EVI routes, so that the ingress PEs can perform the revertive FRR switching based on the time specified by the SCT-EC for the non-adjacent ESes that support the fast DF recovery.</t>
