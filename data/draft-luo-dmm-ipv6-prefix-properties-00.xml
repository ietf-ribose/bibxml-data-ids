      <t>This document proposes a potential distributed mobility management solution by taking advantage of the feature with IPv6 Prefix Mobility Management. Solutions for extending properties to IPv6 prefixes are introduced by defining an extension to the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol and its Prefix Information Option (PIO). In the case of Distributed Mobility Management, this idea can also be leveraged to describe the mobility management properties associated to the IPv6 prefix.</t>
