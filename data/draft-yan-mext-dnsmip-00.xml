    <abstract>
      <t>In order to update the DNS (Domain Name System)[1] resource records (RRs) for the node when its name or address changes, the DDNS (Dynamic DNS) protocol[2] has been standardized as an extension of basic DNS protocol. Then the security DDNS scheme[3] was proposed to enhance the security of DDNS. Based on these two protocols, the DNS update can be used in many scenarios, for example in the DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)[4] deployed environment. Based on these specifications, this document defines the extension in MIPv6 (Mobile IPv6)[5] to achieve DNS update for the named MN (Mobile Node). Specifically speaking, the FQND Option defined in the RFC4704[6] is included in the MIPv6 BU (Binding Update) signaling message. Then the PTR RR or AAAA and PTR RRs may be updated by the HA (Home Agent) when the HoA (Home Address) or name of MN changes.</t>
