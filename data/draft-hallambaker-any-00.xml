    <abstract>
      <t>A proposal for use of DNS names to support universal account identifiers 'handles' is described. Once registered, a handle may be used for authentication to any network service, to initiate communication with the holder or as the basis for IoT device management. This document is a whitepaper proposing the general approach. A strawman prototype supporting single account Web login across multiple sites, onboarding of IoT devices and end to end secure messaging, file-drop, voice and video and has been built using existing and proposed IETF work.</t>
