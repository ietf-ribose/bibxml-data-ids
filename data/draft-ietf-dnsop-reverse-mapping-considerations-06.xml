      <t>Mapping of addresses to names is a feature of DNS. Many sites implement it, many others do not. Some applications attempt to use it as a part of a security strategy. This document outlines what should be taken into account when deciding whether to implement reverse mappings of addresses to names, suggests that site administrators implement reverse mappings if there are no strong considerations against such mappings, and provides considerations to be taken into account when using reverse mappings.</t>
