    <abstract>
      <t>0-RTT mechanisms reduce the time it takes for the first bytes of application data to be processed in a transport connection and can greatly reduce connection latency during setup. The 0-RTT transport features described by quic-transport help clients establish secure connections with a minimal number of round-trips. This document describes a generic method to exchange path parameters relating to transport. The additional transport parameters can help a connection that continues after an interruption or restarts by sharing connection properties. They can be used to increase the performance for a path with large RTT.</t>
