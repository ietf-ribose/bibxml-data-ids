      <t>The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group has standardized metrics for measuring end-to-end performance. This memo defines spatial metrics both for measuring end-to-end network performance using aggregation of sequence of network measures and for measuring the performance of segments of an IP path trajectory. It distinguishes clearly the decomposition of one end-to-end measure result in a sequence of per hop results from the aggregation of a sequence of per hop measure results in an end-to-end result.</t>
