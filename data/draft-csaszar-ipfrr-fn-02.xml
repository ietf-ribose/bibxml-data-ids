    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a mechanism that provides IP fast reroute (IPFRR) by using a failure notification (FN) to nodes beyond the ones that first detect the failure (i.e. nodes that are directly connected to the failure point). The paths used when IPFRR-FN is active are in most cases identical to those used after Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) convergence. The proposed mechanism can address all single link, node, and SRLG failures in an area and has been designed to allow traffic recovery traffic to happen quickly (The goal being to keep traffic loss under 50msec). IPFRR-FN can be a supplemental tool to provide FRR when LFA cannot repair a failure case.</t>
