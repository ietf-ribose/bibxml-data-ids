      <t>Verification Involving PSTN Reachability (ViPR) is a technique forinter-domain SIP federation. ViPR hybridizes the PSTN, P2P networks,and SIP, and in doing so, addresses the phone number routing and VoIPspam problems that have been a barrier to federation. The ViPRarchitecture uses a server, the ViPR server, which performs P2P andvalidation services on behalf of call agents, which acts as clientsto the server. Such an architecture requires a client/serverprotocol between call agents and the ViPR server. That protocol,defined here, is called the ViPR Access Protocol (VAP).LegalThis documents and the information contained therein are provided onan "AS IS" basis and THE CONTRIBUTOR, THE ORGANIZATION HE/SHEREPRESENTS OR IS SPONSORED BY (IF ANY), THE INTERNET SOCIETY, THEIETF TRUST AND THE INTERNET ENGINEERING TASK FORCE DISCLAIM ALLWARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANYWARRANTY THAT THE USE OF THE INFORMATION THEREIN WILL NOT INFRINGEANY RIGHTS OR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESSFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</t>
