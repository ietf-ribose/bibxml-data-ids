      <t>This memo specifies the details of the Host Identity Protocol (HIP).The overall description of protocol and the underlying architecturalthinking is available in the separate HIP architecture specification.The Host Identity Protocol is used to establish a rapidauthentication between two hosts and to provide continuity ofcommunications between those hosts independent of the networkinglayer.The various forms of the Host Identity (HI), Host Identity Tag (HIT),and Local Scope Identifier (LSI), are covered in detail. It isdescribed how they are used to support authentication and theestablishment of keying material, which is then used by IPsecEncapsulated Security payload (ESP) to establish a two-way securedcommunication channel between the hosts. The basic state machine forHIP provides a HIP compliant host with the resiliency to avoid manydenial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The basic HIP exchange for twopublic hosts shows the actual packet flow. Other HIP exchanges,including those that work across NATs are covered elsewhere.</t>
