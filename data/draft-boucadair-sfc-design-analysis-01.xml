    <abstract>
      <t>This document aims at analyzing the various design options and providing a set of recommendations for the design of Service Function Chaining solution(s). Note: o The analysis does not claim to be exhaustive. The list includes a preliminary set of potential solutions; other proposals can be added to the analysis if required. o The analysis is still ongoing. The analysis text will be updated to integrate received comments and inputs. o Sketched recommendations are not frozen. These recommendations are provided as proposals to kick-off the discussion and to challenge them. o The analysis does not cover any application-specific solution (e.g., HTTP header) because of the potential issues inherent to (TLS) encrypted traffic. o The analysis will be updated to take into account the full set of SFC requirements.</t>
