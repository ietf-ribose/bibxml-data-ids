    <abstract>
      <t>Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) policy enables creation of P2MP trees for efficient multi-point packet delivery in a Segment Routing (SR) domain. A SR P2MP Policy consists of Candidate Paths (CP) which define the topology of P2MP tree instances in each Candidate Path. A P2MP tree instance is instantiated by a set of Replication segments. This document specifies the architecture, signaling, and procedures for SR P2MP Policies within Segment Routing over MPLS (SR-MPLS) and Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) dataplane. It defines the P2MP Policy construct, the roles of the root and leaf nodes, Candidate Paths and and how P2MP trees using Replication Segments are instantiated and maintained. Additionally, it describes the required extensions for a controller to support P2MP path computation and provisioning.</t>
