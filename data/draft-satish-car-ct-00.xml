    <abstract>
      <t>Protocols being designed for seamless IP-level handovers, such as fast handover, context transfer (CT) and Candidate Access Router (CAR) discovery protocols will have to go hand in hand for any meaningful seamless handover implementation. The CAR discovery and subsequent Target Access Router (TAR) discovery is achieved through L3 QoS parameters, user preferences and application level QoS parameter match between the geographically adjacent access routers (GAAR). It is asserted in this draft that the primary consideration for fast handover and CAR discovery will still be layer 3 QoS parameters as supported by the ARs.</t>
