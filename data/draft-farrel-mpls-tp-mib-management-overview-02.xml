      <t>A range of Management Information Base (MIB) modules has beendeveloped to help model and manage the various aspects ofMultiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) networks. These MIB modules aredefined in separate documents that focus on the specific areas ofresponsibility of the modules that they describe.The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) is a profile of MPLSfunctionality specific to the construction of packet-switchedtransport networks.This document describes the MIB-based management architecture forMPLS-TP and indicates the interrelationships between the differentMIB modules used for MPLS-TP network management.This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) / International Telecommunication Union TelecommunicationStandardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS TransportProfile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support thecapabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network asdefined by the ITU-T.This Informational Internet-Draft is aimed at achieving IETFConsensus before publication as an RFC and will be subject to an IETFLast Call.[RFC Editor, please remove this note before publication as an RFC andinsert the correct Streams Boilerplate to indicate that the publishedRFC has IETF Consensus.]Farrel &amp; King, et al.[page 1]draft-farrel-mpls-tp-mib-management-overview-01.txtSeptember 2010</t>
