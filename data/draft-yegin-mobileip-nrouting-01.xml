      <t>The Mobile IP working group is currently examining proposals toassist in minimizing the latency and packet loss due to handoffswhen a Mobile IPv6 node moves from one point of attachment toanother. One of the desires to reduce this latency and packet lossis a result of the strict requirements of real-time networkservices. This proposal specifies a solution whereby the mobilenode sends a binding update with multiple care-of-addresses whichmatch the current link and other links that the mobile node maypossibly visit next. After receiving such a binding update, the correspondent nodes and home agent use a new routing header extension to route the packet that will be received by the mobile node at one of the possible care-of-addresses. Thus, the correspondent nodes and home agent can still communicate with the mobile node despite not knowing its exact location while themobile node moves across links. The proposal presents no new networking entities and the resulting architecture describes anatural extension to the Mobile IPv6 protocol.</t>
