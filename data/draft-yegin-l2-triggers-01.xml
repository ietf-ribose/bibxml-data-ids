      <t>Wireless and mobile hosts are subject to changing their point of attachment from one access network to another. These changes result in link-layer events such as link up and link down. Information on these events can be conveyed to interested parties in the form of link-layer triggers. Primary consumers of this information are the modules implementing mobility related network-layer protocols. When provider and consumer of this information are co-located on the same IP node, required communication can take place via internal mechanisms. But when they are separate, as in the case of networks using wired-to-wireless bridges, a transport mechanism is needed to convey link-layer triggers. This draft defines a UDP based client- server protocol for transporting link-layer triggers between two IP nodes.</t>
