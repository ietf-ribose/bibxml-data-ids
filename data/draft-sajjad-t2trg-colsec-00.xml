    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes an architecture for Collaborative Security and Proactive Defence against IoT Botnets. The proposed architecture is based on the violation of the Manufacturer Usage Description policy. This architecture provides a means of sharing the attacker information including its Command and Control Server information with the peers in order to not only achieve proactive defense against Internet of Things botnets but also mitigate them at its source end.</t>
