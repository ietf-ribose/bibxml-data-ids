    <abstract>
      <t>Reducing technology's carbon footprint is one of the big challenges of our age. Networks are an enabler of applications that reduce this footprint, but also contribute to this footprint substantially themselves. Many of the biggest opportunities to reduce this footprint may not be management or even networking specific, for instance general power efficiency gains in hardware or deployment of equipment in more energy-efficient buildings. However, methods to make networking technology itself "greener" and in particular to manage networks in ways that reduces their carbon footprint without impacting their utility also need to be explored. This document outlines a corresponding set of opportunities, along with associated research challenges, for networking technology in general and management technology in particular to become "greener" and reduce network carbon footprint.</t>
