      <t>This document proposes a new, XML-based canonical format for RFCs that explicitly allows external art as a normative part of the RFC. If the RFC Editor chooses this format, they will also publish non- canonical versions of RFCs in order to accomodate the largest target audience of readers. Having a simple, stable canonical format and a varying number of non-canonical formats that can change over time allows the RFC Editor to add useful formats, particularly in HTML, that can keep up with the needs of all RFC readers.</t>
