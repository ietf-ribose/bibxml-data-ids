    <abstract>
      <t>Host-to-network signaling and network-to-host signaling can improve the user experience to adapt to network's constraints and share expected application needs, and thus to provide differentiated service to a flow and to packets within a flow. The differentiated service may be provided at the network (e.g., packet prioritization), the server (e.g., adaptive transmission), or both. This document describes how clients can communicate with their nearby network elements so they can learn network constraints. Optionally, with QUIC server support their incoming QUIC packets can be mapped to metadata about their contents so packet importance can influence both intentional and reactive management policies. The framework handles both directions of a flow.</t>
