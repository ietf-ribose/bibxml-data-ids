      <t>This draft discusses some BGP features for ASN migration that, while commonly used, are not formally part of the BGP4 protocol specification and may be vendor-specific in exact implementation. It is necessary to document these de facto standards to ensure that they are properly supported in future BGP protocol work such as BGPSec.</t>
