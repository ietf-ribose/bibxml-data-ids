    <abstract>
      <t>Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) have increasedthe use of sensing technologies for IoT applications. However,monitoring sensor nodes is still a challenging issue indistributed remote environments, especially wireless environments.Different from conventional centralized mechanism, Fog Computingbecomes an essential role in a scalable IoT system. Fog Node cancontrol and monitor its subdomain's devices and perform aggregationtasks to support the central server at the cloud. Since nodefault detection can strongly affect the performance and accuracyin most IoT analysis applications, fault detection mechanismshould be integrated into IoT Networks. Accordingly, thesefault nodes could be detected and replaced by others availablenodes in the same domain for the analysis by a distributedfault detection and node replacement mechanism based on theirsensory values in a considered domain.</t>
