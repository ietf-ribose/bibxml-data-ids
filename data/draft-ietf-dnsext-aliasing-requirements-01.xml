      <t>This document attempts to describe a set of issues that arises fromthe desire to treat a set or group of names as "aliases" of eachother, "bundled," "variants," or "the same," which is problematic interms of corresponding behavior for DNS labels and FQDNs.With the emergence of internationalized domain names, among otherpotential use cases, two or more names that users will regard ashaving identical meaning may sometimes require corresponding behaviorin the underlying infrastructure, possibly in the DNS itself. It'snot clear how to accommodate this required behavior of such names inDNS resolution; in particular, it's not clear when they are bestaccommodated in registry practices for generating names for lookup inthe DNS, existing DNS protocol elements and behavior, existingapplication-layer mechanisms and practices, or some set of protocolelements or behavior not yet defined. This document attempts todescribe some of these cases and the behavior of some of the possiblesolutions discussed to date.</t>
