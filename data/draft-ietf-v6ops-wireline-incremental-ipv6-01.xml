      <t>Operators worldwide are in various stages of preparing for, or deploying IPv6 into their networks. The operators often face difficult challenges related to both IPv6 introduction along with those related to IPv4 run out. Operators will need to meet the simultaneous needs of IPv6 connectivity and continue support for IPv4 connectivity for legacy devices with a depleting supply of IPv4 addresses. The IPv6 transition will take most networks from an IPv4- only environment to an IPv6 focused environment with long period of dual stack operation varying by operator. This document helps provide a framework for Wireline providers who are faced with the challenges of introducing IPv6 along meeting the legacy needs of IPv4 connectivity utilizing well defined and commercially available IPv6 transition technologies.</t>
