    <abstract>
      <t>Network path validation refers to a technology that ensures data packets to strictly travel along a chosen network path. It aims to enforce data to travel only on the assigned network path and provide evidence that the data has indeed followed this path. While existing efforts primarily focus on the control plane, path validation protects and monitors routing security in the data plane. This document provides a technical definition of the Network Path Validation problem, briefly overviews past efforts, models its ideal solution and design goals, and lists out different use case across various layers of the Internet.</t>
