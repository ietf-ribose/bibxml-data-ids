      <t>The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol is used to detect faults on interfaces and data links. This document describes a mechanism to run a BFD async session per member link of a Link Aggregation (LAG) interface, BFD would be able to run at a much aggressive rate then Link aggregation control protocol (LACP), and can run in the absence of LACP, and would be able to verify L3 connectivity per member link.</t>
