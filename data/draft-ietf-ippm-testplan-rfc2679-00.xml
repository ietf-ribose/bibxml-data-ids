      <t>This memo proposes to advance a performance metric RFC along the standards track, specifically RFC 2679 on One-way Delay Metrics. Observing that the metric definitions themselves should be the primary focus rather than the implementations of metrics, this memo describes the test procedures to evaluate specific metric requirement clauses to determine if the requirement has been interpreted and implemented as intended. Two completely independent implementations have been tested against the key specifications of RFC 2679.</t>
