      <t>In the daily communication between technicians, engineers and other people who need to deal with computer networks, it is often necessary to refer to particular parts of IP addresses. In the world of IPv4, the term "octet" is well established, however as the use of IPv6 is spreading, it becomes apparent that there is no such commonly accepted term for IPv6 addresses. Discussing and explaining technical matters become difficult when different people use different terms for the same thing. Therefore, this document discusses several naming proposal for those 16bit pieces of IPv6 addreses.</t>
