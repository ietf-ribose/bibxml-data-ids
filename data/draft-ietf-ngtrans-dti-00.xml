      <t>We propose to use an IPv6 tunneling mechanism and encapsulate IPv4 packets into IPv6 packets. This eases the transition and routers do not need to support IPv6 and IPv4 routing tables. The IN_ADDR.arpa domain is used to find IPv4 to IPv6 correspondence in a way that does not prevent the asymmetrical routing and multi-homing. The model also simplifies IPv4 address management since the address has no more a localization function but only an identification function.</t>
