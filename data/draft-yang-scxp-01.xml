      <t>At present, various security components have appeared. All the security components should work together to establish a stronger defense architecture in the future, so it is necessary for these components to communicate with each other. This document describes the Security Components Exchange Protocol (SCXP), an application-level protocol for exchanging data between security components. SCXP supports mutual-authentication, integrity, confidentiality and replay protection over a connection-oriented protocol.</t>
