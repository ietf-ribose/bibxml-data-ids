      <t>This document specifies integrity and replay protection for required implementation in the MANET Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) and the Optimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2 (OLSRv2). This document specifies how an included integrity check value (ICV) and a timestamp TLV, defined in RFC6622bis, are used by NHDP and OLSRv2 for countering a number of security threats. The ICV TLV uses a SHA-256 based HMAC and a single shared secret key. The timestamp TLV is based on POSIX time, assuming router synchronization. The mechanism in this specification can also be used for other MANET protocols using RFC5444.</t>
