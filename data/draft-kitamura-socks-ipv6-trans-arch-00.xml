      <t>This document describes an IPv6/IPv4 Translator architecture that is based on the SOCKSv5 [RFC1928] mechanism. In this architecture, the SOCKS mechanism is extended by adding adaptive address family distinguish functions for supporting heterogeneous communications. By applying the mechanism together with protocol conversion functions, the IPv6/IPv4 Translator architecture is accomplished. This Translator provides communications between IPv6 and IPv4 nodes without sacrificing any convenience and functionalities of current communication methods. It is NOT necessary to modify the current DNS system at all. Only socksify environment is needed to communicate between IPv6 and IPv4 nodes. By using multiple chained Translators, a tunneling-like communication topology can be realized. With the architecture, there is no vulnerability of the packet fragmentation, and the connection can be authenticated by the native SOCKS authentication methods.</t>
