    <abstract>
      <t>In certain networks, it is critical to consider network performance criteria when selecting the path for an explicitly routed RSVP-TE LSP. Such performance criteria can include latency, jitter, and loss or other indications such as the conformance to link performance objectives and non-RSVP TE traffic load. This specification describes how a path computation function may use network performance data, such as is advertised via the OSPF and ISIS TE metric extensions (defined outside the scope of this document) to perform such path selections.</t>
