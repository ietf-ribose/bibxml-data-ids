      <t>This document describes the use of the ARIA block cipher algorithm in conjunction with several different modes of operation within IKE and IPsec. It describes the use of ARIA in CBC, CTR, GCM and CCM modes to encrypt and/or authenticate IKE and ESP traffic. It also describes the use of ARIA in XCBC, CMAC, and GMAC modes to authenticate IKE, ESP and AH traffic. The use of ARIA in XCBC and CMAC modes for pseudorandom functions is also included.</t>
