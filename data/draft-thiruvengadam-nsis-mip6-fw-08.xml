      <t>Most of the firewalls deployed today are Mobile IPv6 unaware. Widespread Mobile IPv6 deployment is not possible unless Mobile IPv6 messages can pass through these firewalls. One approach is to use a signaling protocol to communicate with these firewalls and instruct them to bypass these Mobile IPv6 messages. The goal of this document is to describe the interaction between NSIS and Mobile IPv6 for enabling Mobile IPv6 traversal.</t>
