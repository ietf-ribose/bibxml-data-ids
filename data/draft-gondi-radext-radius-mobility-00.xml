      <t>Increase in the usage of different access networks, the role of Radius server is increased to provide access across different access networks and access technologies. AAA server provides access to user terminals in different security mechanisms in access networks. Due to the robust architecture of radius server, the functionalities of server can be extended to provide different services other than the authentication and access to the user terminal. In this draft we are proposing to extend the functionalities of the radius server for the mobility management of the user in the access networks. In this process the Radius server performs the mobility context management of the user when its roaming or during handover from the visiting network and the home network. In this draft we are proposing to accommodate Proxy Mobile IP (PMIP) using these extensions. In this proposed architecture we have defined new attributes and packet format when a Radius server communicates with the MPA/HA of the PMIP architecture as well as with another Radius server for context management.</t>
