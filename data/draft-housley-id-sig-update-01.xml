      <t>RFC 5485 specifies the conventions for digital signatures on Internet-Draft documents. The Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) is used to create a detached signature, which is stored in a separate companion file so that no existing utilities are impacted by the addition of the digital signature. The RFC Editor recently published the first RFC that includes non- ASCII characters in a "text" file. The conventions specified in RFC 7997 were followed. We assume that non-ASCII characters will soon start appearing in Internet-Drafts as well. This document updates the handling of digital signatures on Internet-Draft document for non-ASCII characters in a "text" file. This document (once approved) updates RFC 5485.</t>
