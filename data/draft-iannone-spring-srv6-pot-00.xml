    <abstract>
      <t>Various technologies, including SRv6, allow to perform Traffic Engineering (TE), steering IP traffic through a specific path. However, there is no native mechanism in IP that allows to verify whether or not a packet did follow the path it was supposed to. This document specifies a new TLV for the Segment Routing Header (SRH) that allows to provide a cryptographically generated proof of transit over the different segments. The proposed mechanisms allows to verify whether a packet did go through the segments listed in its SRH header in the intended order.</t>
