      <t>The NSIS working group is considering protocols for signaling for resources for a traffic flow along its path in the network. The requirements for such signaling are being developed in [2] and a framework in [3]. It is clear from existing work that there are many interrelated issues with NSIS signaling, concerning the respective roles of the two ends of the communication path. These issues include route finding, authorisation, state management requirements, localization of negotiation, and so on. The wide variety of problems involved hinders progress in deciding what approach NSIS should adopt. This Internet Draft attempts to provide a summary of these issues and suggests a way of structuring further analysis. It is not expected that this document should have a long term existence.</t>
