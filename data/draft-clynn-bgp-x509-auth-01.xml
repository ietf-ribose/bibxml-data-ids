      <t>This document defines three X.509 v3 Certificate Extensions. The first binds a list of IP Address blocks to the public key of the subject of a certificate. The second binds a list of Autonomous System Numbers to the public key of the subject of a certificate. The third binds a BGP Router Identifier and an Autonomous System Number to the public key of the subject of a certificate. Third parties, e.g., BGP routers, may use these certificates to verify that the holder of the private key corresponding to the public key in the certificate has been properly authorized to use resources specified in the certificate extension.</t>
