      <t>We present here a simple access protocol to a 'white page' service. This protocol is based on the experience acquired in several X.500 based 'white page' pilots, and builds upon such developments as the 'user friendly naming' notation or the 'centroids' concept developed in the 'whois++' project. Although largely inspired by the X.500 protocol, SOLO does not try follow the X.500 model. Designing a SOLO front-end to an X.500 server is very easy, but the SOLO internetworking is not based on X.500 -- the navigation part is based on the WHOIS++ centroids. In fact, one can as well design a SOLO front-end to a WHOIS server, and only minor efforts are needed for redesigning a 'finger' daemon to provide the SOLO service. Conversely, the SOLO service is powerful enough to make gatewaying between X.500 access protocols and SOLO easy. The first section of this memo present the basic SOLO protocol. The second section presents the methods which are used for 'networking' SOLO servers. The third section is a formal definition of the SOLO protocol. Section 4 list the various SOLO information messages. Section 5 addresses the security implications of providing a SOLO service.</t>
