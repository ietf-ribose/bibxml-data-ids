    <abstract>
      <t>GMPLS provides control for multiple switching technologies, and hierarchical switching within a technology. GMPLS routing and signaling use common values to indicate switching technology type. These values are carried in routing in the Switching Capability field, and in signaling in the Switching Type field. While the values using in these fields are the primary indicators of the technology and hierarchy level being controlled, the values are not consistently defined and used across the different technologies supported by GMPLS. This document is intended to resolve the inconsistent definition and use of the Switching Capability and Type fields by narrowly scoping the meaning and use of the fields. This document updates any document that uses the GMPLS Switching Capability and Types fields, in particular RFC 3471, RFC 4202, RFC 4203, and RFC 5307.</t>
