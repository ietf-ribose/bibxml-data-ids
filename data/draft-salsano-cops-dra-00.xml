      <t>This document introduces a new client type for the COPS protocol to support dynamic DiffServ resource allocation. The client type supports both the Outsourcing and the Provisioning model to achieve a scalable, efficient and flexible handling of network resources. The defined client type can be used: i) on the interface between an Edge Router (Policy Enforcement Point - PEP) and a Diffserv 'Bandwidth Broker' (acting as Policy Decision Point -PDP); ii) on the interface between a client of a QoS enabled network (acting as PEP) and the access point of the network provider (e.g. the Edge Router acting as PDP)</t>
