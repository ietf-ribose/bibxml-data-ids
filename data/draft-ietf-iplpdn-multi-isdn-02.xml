      <t>This document enumerates the existing means for transmitting Internet Protocols across public data networks using circuit-mode ISDN, and other switched services. It recommends limiting the choices to the three most common methods, from which one can determine which method is in use by inspection of the packets. The intention is to capture in a slightly more formal way the level of consensus reached at the 24th - 27th IETF meetings.</t>
