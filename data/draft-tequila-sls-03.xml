      <t>This document depicts a standard set of information to be (dynamically) negotiated between a customer and an IP service provider or between service providers, by means of instantiated Service Level Specifications (SLS). It also specifies the corresponding semantics of such information, so that it might be appropriately modeled and processed by the above-mentioned parties in an automated fashion.</t>
