    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the mechanism to associate network resource attributes to Segment Routing Identifiers (SIDs). Such SIDs are referred to as resource-aware SIDs in this document. The resource- aware SIDs retain their original forwarding semantics, but with the additional semantics to identify the set of network resources available for the packet processing action. The resource-aware SIDs can therefore be used to build SR paths with a set of reserved network resources. In addition, the resource-aware SIDs can also be used to build SR based virtual networks, which provide the network topology and resource attributes required by customers or services. The proposed mechanism is applicable to both segment routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).</t>
