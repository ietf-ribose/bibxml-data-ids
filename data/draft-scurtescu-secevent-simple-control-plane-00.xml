      <t>Security Event Token (SET) delivery requires event receivers to indicate to event transmitters the subjects about which they wish to receive events, and how they wish to receive them. This specification defines an HTTP API for a basic control plane that event transmitters can implement and event receivers may use to manage the flow of events from one to the other.</t>
