      <t>Many Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) today have some mechanism to resolve them to one or more specific endpoints where that resource is available. This document discusses issues that arise when the same resource can be reached over multiple protocol stacks, and discusses various approaches that have been used or discussed, and the tradeoffs between them. Such issues are important to consider when defining new URI schemes and resolution mechanisms.</t>
