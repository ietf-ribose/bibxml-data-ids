      <t>This document discusses, for the IPv4-IPv6 coexistence period, thecombined requirement that: (1) legacy IPv4 hosts can establish IPv4transport connection s from customer sites having IPv6-only permanentaddresses; (2) for good scalability, no network address translations(NATs), and a fortiori no application level gateways (ALGs), need tobe supported within network infrastructures. To satisfy thisrequirement, it is concluded that an address-port-borrowing-protocol(APBP) is needed.</t>
