      <t>The IPv6 Addressing Architecture [Hinden, 1998] defines the 'IPv4-mappedIPv6 address.' These addresses are used in the IPv6 basic API[Gilligan, 1999] to denote IPv4 addresses using AF_INET6 sockets. Theseaddresses are used in protocol proposals such as SIIT [Nordmark, 2000]to denote IPv6 communication using AF_INET6 sockets. Therefore,IPv4-mapped addresses have two different meanings, and they are notdistinguishable from the user-land applications.This draft discusses security threats due to this ambiguity ofIPv4-mapped address. It also discusses threats due to the additionalcomplexities introduced by IPv4-mapped addresses. Finally, it proposesto resolve these problems by forbidding protocols from using IPv4-mappedaddresses for IPv6 communications.</t>
