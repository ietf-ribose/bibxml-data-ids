      <t>This document provides requirements for security services based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) with two representative use cases: (i) centralized firewall system and (ii) centralized DDoS-attack mitigation system. For the centralized firewall system, this document raises challenging issues in existing firewalls and proposes a solution for such challenges with a use case of the centralized firewall system based on SDN. For the centralized DDoS-attack mitigation system, this document also raises challenging issues in existing DDoS-attack mitigation techniques and proposes a solution for such challenges with a use case of the centralized DDoS-attack mitigation system based on SDN.</t>
