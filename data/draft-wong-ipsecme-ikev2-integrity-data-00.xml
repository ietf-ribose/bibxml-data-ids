      <t>IKEv2 supports mutual authentication of the peers but does notsupport platform integrity validation of the peers nor does itsupport the exchange of data related to the platform integrityvalidation. This extension allows platform integrity validationdata to be exchanged from one peer (initiator) to another(respondent), allowing the other peer to either use the data forstatistical analysis, pass it along to a validation entity forvalidation or pass it along to a Fraud Information Gathering Systemfor fraud detection or analysis.</t>
