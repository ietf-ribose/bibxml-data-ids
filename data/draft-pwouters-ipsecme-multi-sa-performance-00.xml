    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines four Notify Message Type Payloads for the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) indicating support for the negotiation of multiple identical Child SAs to optimize performance. The CPU_QUEUES notification indicates support for multiple queues or CPUs. The QOS_QUEUES notification indicates support for different Quality of Service (QoS) levels. The CPU_QUEUE_INFO and QOS_QUEUE_INFO notification are used to confirm and optionally convey information about the specific queue, such as QoS level. Using multiple identical Child SAs has the benefit that each stream has its own Sequence Number Counter, ensuring that CPUs don't have to synchronize their crypto state or disable their packet replay protection.</t>
