      <t>This document proposes a coping mechanism used to deal with the unpredictable disruption problem and congestion control problem in Space Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) [RFC4838]. Since Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) [RFC5326] provides retransmission-based reliability for bundles, several times of retransmissions can be seen as a failure occurred over links. The proposed mechanism is used to direct the following packets to other nodes as soon as the selected path is detected as disruption or congestion and probes the availability of the links which has disrupted unexpectedly.</t>
