    <abstract>
      <t>Accessing the Internet via mobile data services using smartphones, tablets, and mobile data USB dongles has increased rapidly, as high-speed packet data networks provide the bandwidth required for today's Internet applications. Mobile operators will continue to evolve their core networks to the Long Term Evolution (LTE) Evolved Packet Core (EPC) to meet the mobility, latency and bandwidth requirements for mobile data users. Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) looks to reduce mobile core network complexity and related operational issues by leveraging standard IT virtualization technologies and consolidate different types of network equipment onto commodity hardware. This use case document provides resiliency requirements for virtualization of the LTE mobile core network, known as virtualized EPC (vEPC).</t>
