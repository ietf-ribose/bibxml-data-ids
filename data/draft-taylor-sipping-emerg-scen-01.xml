      <t>This document examines the scenarios within which SIP phones may be used to contact emergency call centres. Beginning with an overview of the high level system requirements for contacting emergency call centres in the PSTN, the scenarios involving stationary or nomadic SIP phones are described and then alternative strategies for supporting the information flows for the scenarios needed to meet these requirements are examined. The major finding from the point of view of SIP standardization is it would be helpful in a number of scenarios if a location header field could be added either by the SIP phone or by a proxy to indicate the location of the phone in a machine-readable way.</t>
