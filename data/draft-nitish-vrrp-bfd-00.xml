      <t>This draft presents an enhanced failure detection mechanism to detect the failure of VRRP Master router on the LAN using a peer learning mode. Typically the VRRP protocol is able to perform the transparent fail-over detection within a time period of 3 seconds with default fail-over timers. Real-time protocols (voice/video/real-time transactional) require a maximum network disruption in the order of 150ms for traffic on the network. A failure detection and fail-over time of 150ms on conventionally configured VRRP protocol is extremely aggressive and may impact the reliability and performance of the network. A more efficient mechanism for real-time failure detection can be enabled in VRRP protocol by building a peer table, using a new VRRP Advert packet type. This will help in forming a mesh of BFD sessions. Once the BFD sessions are created, VRRP can receive faster notification of failures, without the overhead of increased VRRP protocol Advert messages.</t>
