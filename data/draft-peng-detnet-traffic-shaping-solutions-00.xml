    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents a traffic shaping solution for DetNet service with bounded latency in large-scale networks. The traffic shaping solution includes the edge access control, enqueue cycle mapping and jitter compression mechanisms. These mechanisms support appropriate resource reservation algorithms, reasonably calculate the end-to-end delay in DetNet IP network in advance, and adjust, manage and control the resources after real-time detection. Using the traffic shaping solution, it is possible for an implementer, user, or standards development organization to realize bounded delay based on the existing TSN/DetNet queuing models.</t>
