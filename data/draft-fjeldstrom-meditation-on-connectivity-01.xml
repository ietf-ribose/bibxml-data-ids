      <t>This document presents a systemic meditation on how the Internet arrived at its present connectivity equilibrium. The analysis proceeds by retrospective reconstruction: examining observable adaptations, constraints, and deferred decisions across multiple layers of the stack, rather than by benchmarking, simulation, or protocol comparison. The term "meditation" is used deliberately to indicate a method grounded in historical observation, accumulated operational experience, and the interpretation of persistent compensatory mechanisms as empirical evidence of structural conditions. The document does not assign fault, advocate specific remedies, or propose new protocol mechanisms. Instead, it seeks to explain how a sequence of locally rational responses to real pressures interacted over time to produce a stable, but heavily mediated, connectivity equilibrium at Internet scale.</t>
