      <t>SONAR is a service which, when presented with a list of InternetProtocol addresses, attempts to order that list according to theproximity from the SONAR server to each address. Given multiplelocations for a network accessible resource, SONAR is designed to helpnetworked applications make a reasonable choice between thosealternatives. This memo describes the SONAR protocol as well as anexperimental implementation of the SONAR service. While the name 'SONAR' is intended as a pun on the 'ping' utilitythat uses ICMP echo requests to verify network connectivity, the SONARservice does not specify use of any particular means of estimatingnetwork proximity. To the contrary, the design of SONAR assumes thatthe best means of estimating network proximity will change over time andperhaps from one network location to another. The SONAR protocol isintended to provide a stable interface for applications that need tomeasure network proximity, thus allowing proximity measurementalgorithms to evolve separately from those applications.</t>
