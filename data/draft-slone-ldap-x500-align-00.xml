      <t>This document is intended to provide information of interest to developers of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) specifications and products. It is intended to provide background information and to facilitate discussion within IETF Working Groups, most notably LDAPbis. This Internet-Draft highlights decisions made by group attending the ITU-T and ISO/IEC JTC1 Collaborative Meeting on the Directory in London in February 2003 for inclusion in an upcoming Proposed Draft Amendment (PDAM) to the ITU-T X.500 / IS 9594 Specification. It also identifies issues that the X.500 group would like to bring to the attention of the LDAPbis Working Group at the upcoming IETF meeting in March.</t>
