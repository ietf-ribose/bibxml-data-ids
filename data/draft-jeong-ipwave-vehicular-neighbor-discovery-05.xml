      <t>This document specifies a Vehicular Neighbor Discovery (VND) as an extension of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) for IP-based vehicular networks. An optimized Address Registration and a multihop Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) mechanism are established for both operation efficiency and the saving of wireless bandwidth and vehicle energy. Also, the three new ND options for prefix discovery, service discovery, and mobility information report are used to announce the network prefixes and services inside a vehicle (i.e., a vehicle's internal network). Finally, a mobility management scheme is proposed for moving vehicles in vehicular environments to support seamless communication for the continuity of transport-layer sessions (e.g., TCP connections).</t>
