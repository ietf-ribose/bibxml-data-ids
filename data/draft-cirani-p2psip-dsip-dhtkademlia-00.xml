      <t>This draft describes a Kademlia-based protocol for Resource Lookup inP2PSIP. The proposed protocol is based on dSIP, a SIP-based protocolproposed by other authors as generic framework for a distributed SIPLocation Service. Although the dSIP authors have obsoleted the draftby a newer approach based on a binary protocol named RELOAD, we arestill considering this SIP-based approach, due to implementationsimplicity, possibility of reuse of already available SIP stackimplementations, easy integration into existing UAs, minimization ofthe number of required protocols for a P2P UA, and widespread supportfor (and relative maturity of) the SIP standard.</t>
