      <t>The main use of NAT is to connect an existing internal network via an ISP to the Internet. The current NAT RFC1631 supposes that the network number used for the translation is not existing physically on any network. This does not work in some circumstances where the router connected to the ISP line is not under control of the user. This implies that the network where the NAT router is connected to, has the same network number than the one used by NAT.</t>
