      <t>Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) has been proposed to overcome thedeployment limitations of PIM-SM such as handling of well-knownsources, access control, and address allocation. However, currentSSM work seems to neglect some other deployment issues such as theconstruction of the shortest path tree especially in inter-domain. The routing table entries for constructing SSM tree proportionallyincrease depending on the number of sources and groups.</t>
