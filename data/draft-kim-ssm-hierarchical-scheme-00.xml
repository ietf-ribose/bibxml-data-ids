      <t>Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) has been proposed to overcome the deployment limitations of PIM-SM such as handling of well-known sources, access control, and address allocation. However, current SSM work seems to neglect some other deployment issues such as the construction of the shortest path tree especially in inter-domain. The routing table entries for constructing SSM tree proportionally increase depending on the number of sources and groups.</t>
