      <t>In-line network management prediction exploits fine-grained models of network components, injected into the communication network, to enhance network performance. Accurate and fast prediction of local network state enables more intelligent network control resulting in greater performance and fault tolerance. Accurate and fast prediction requires algorithmic capability. Active and Programmable Networking have enabled algorithmic information to be dynamically injected into the network allowing enhanced capability and flexibility. One of the new capabilities is enhanced network management via in-line management code, that is, management algorithms embedded within intermediate network devices. In-line network management prediction utilizes low-level algorithmic transport capability to implement low-overhead predictive management. A secondary purpose of this document is to provide general interoperability information for the injection of general purpose algorithmic information into network devices. This document may help in some manner to serve as a temporary bridge between Internet Protocol and Active and Programmable Network applications. This may stimulate some thought as to the content and format of 'standards' information potentially required for Active Networking. Management of the Internet Protocol and Active and Programmable Networking is vital. In particular, coexistence and interoperability of active networking and Internet Protocol management is specified in order to implement the injection of algorithmic information into a network.</t>
