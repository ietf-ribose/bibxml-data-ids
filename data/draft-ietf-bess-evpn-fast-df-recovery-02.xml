    <abstract>
      <t>Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) solution provides Designated Forwarder election procedures for multi-homing Ethernet Segments. These procedures have been enhanced further by applying Highest Random Weight (HRW) Algorithm for Designated Forwarded election in order to avoid unnecessary DF status changes upon a failure. This draft improves these procedures by providing a fast Designated Forwarder (DF) election upon recovery of the failed link or node associated with the multi-homing Ethernet Segment. The solution is independent of number of EVIs associated with that Ethernet Segment and it is performed via a simple signaling between the recovered PE and each PEs in the multi-homing group.</t>
