      <t>The intentions for the IPv6 host configuration design, was to configure the core network layer parameters with IPv6 ND, and use service discovery for other configuration parameters. Unfortunately that hasn't panned out as planned, and we are in a situation where all kinds of configuration options are requested in RAs and in DHCP. This document proposes an a new universal option, formatted in JSON. The list of elements are maintained in an IANA registry, with greatly relaxed rules for registration.</t>
