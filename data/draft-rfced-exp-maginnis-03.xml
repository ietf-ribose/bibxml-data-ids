      <t>A contributing factor to the explosive growth in IP address allocation is the coming together of two seeming unrelated factors. One factor is arbitrary relationship within the Domain Name Server that requires an unique IP address to be associated with a Domain Name. The second factor is the public's desire to have short Domain Names unique to their enterprise. We believe a small modification to the Domain Name Server will break this relationship and lessen pressure on IP address allocation. This modification should also make system configuration easier than dealing with IP addresses for each Domain Name supported on a given host. One difficulty with the proposed modification is that similar 'small' changes are required in the WWW browsers to pick up the port number and append it to the URL.</t>
