      <t>A device can simultaneously connect to multiple access networks, e.g., Wi-Fi, LTE, 5G, DSL, and SATCOM (Satellite Communications). It is desirable to seamlessly combine multiple connections over these networks below the transport layer (L4) to improve quality of experience for applications that do not have built-in multi- path capabilities. This document presents a new convergence protocol for managing data traffic across multiple network paths. The solution has been developed by the authors based on their experiences in multiple standards bodies including IETF and 3GPP, is not an Internet Standard and does not represent the consensus opinion of the IETF. This document will enable other developers to build interoperable implementations to experiment with the protocol.</t>
