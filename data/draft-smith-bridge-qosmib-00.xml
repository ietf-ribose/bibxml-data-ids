      <t>This memo describes a SMIv2 MIB module for a device implementing bridging functions with Quality-of-Service mechanisms similar to those described for the Differentiated Services Architecture [DSARCH] which are described in detail by the Differentiated Services Router Conceptual Model [MODEL]. A MIB module for routers, the Diffserv MIB [DSMIB], has been developed that uses this model. The MIB module defined in this memo is designed to work in conjunction with that module: it defines usage for objects in that module and defines some new objects specific to MAC- layer bridges (a.k.a. Layer-2 switches). Specifically, if defines layer-2 classifier and packet marking functionality.</t>
