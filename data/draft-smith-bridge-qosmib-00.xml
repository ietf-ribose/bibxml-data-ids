      <t>This memo describes a SMIv2 MIB module for a device implementingbridging functions with Quality-of-Service mechanisms similar to thosedescribed for the Differentiated Services Architecture [DSARCH] whichare described in detail by the Differentiated Services Router ConceptualModel [MODEL]. A MIB module for routers, the Diffserv MIB [DSMIB], hasbeen developed that uses this model. The MIB module defined in this memois designed to work in conjunction with that module: it defines usagefor objects in that module and defines some new objects specific to MAC-layer bridges (a.k.a. Layer-2 switches). Specifically, if defineslayer-2 classifier and packet marking functionality.</t>
