      <t>QUIC encrypts its Initial Packets using keys derived from well-known constants, meaning that observers can inspect the contents of these packets and successfully spoof them. This document proposes a new version of QUIC that encrypts Initial Packets more securely by leveraging a Public Key distributed via the Domain Name System (DNS) or other out-of-band system.</t>
