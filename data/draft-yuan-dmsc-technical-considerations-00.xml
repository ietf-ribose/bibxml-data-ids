    <abstract>
      <t>With the maturity of cloud native application development, applications can be decomposed into finer grained atomic services. On the other hand, as a distributed computing paradigm, fine grained micro-services could be deployed and implemented in a distributive way among edges to make computing, storage and run-time processing capabilities as close to users as possible to provide satisfied QoE. Under the circumstances analyzed, updated framework and architecture would be required and designed, aiming to wisely allocate and schedule resources and services in order to provide consistent end- to-end service provisioning with Distributed Micro Service Communication (DMSC).</t>
