    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a usecase, called BBU aggregation, for integreting radio and optical networks. It aims to compact several low-utilized BBU cards into one BBU to improve the BBU utilization. A flexible optical fronthaul network is connecting BBU and RRU to enable BBU aggregation by recongfiguring the lightpath between BBU and RRU. The procedure of the usecase is based on the unified radio and optical control archtecture, and an extended OpenFlow protocol is introduced to realize the procedure.</t>
