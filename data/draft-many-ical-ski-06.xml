      <t>This Memo defines the SKiCal format. SKiCal is a machine-readable format for the interchange of enhanced yellow-page directory listings. SkiCal expands the traditional property-set of name, address, telephone number and business category, adding structured information about people, places, things, activities and the conditions and terms for interaction with resources.SkiCal provides a structure for information about dates and times, directions, rules and recommendations for participation, pricing and reservation schemes, access information for those with special needs, ownership and responsibilities and promotional material. The referents of these listings, which are both events and persistent resources are referred to in this draft as SkiSources. SkiCal is based on and extends the iCalendar format as defined by RFC-2445, Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification [3] (iCalendar). SkiCal objects are comprised of either VEVENT components with the addition of new properties and property parameters, or the SkiCal specific VOPTIME calendar component described in this memo.</t>
