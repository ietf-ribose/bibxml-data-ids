    <abstract>
      <t>Several label switching schemes have been proposed to fuse and integrate the cost-performance and QoS assurance of Layer 2 devices and the flexibility and functionality of Layer 3 protocols. Some of these proposals assume that Label Switching Routers (LSRs) are placed in a homogeneous LSR cloud in a campus area network or a backbone network, and they are connected directly to each other. However, this assumption sometimes does not hold true in the real situation. For example, some campuses will be connected via ATM SVC service, and LSR networks will be constructed hierarchically. To deal with Virtual Connections (VCs) in these environments, this document proposes to identify a VC with a VCID instead of a label.</t>
