      <t>Multi mode terminals are becoming pervasive. In a multi mode environment, Mobile Terminals (MTs) move from the coverage of one radio access network to another. There is a need to maintain ongoing network sessions to support seamless services. For example, a MT may roam between a 3G cellular network and a wireless LAN seamlessly with session continuity. It is possible for a single service provider to support multiple modes but it is expected that different modes will be supported by different service providers. For example WLAN support can be enterprise supported where as 3G services are supported by a wide area service provider. In this draft we discuss handover support between multiple domains (modes) where a MT can use different IP addresses or can use a global IP address. Handover between different modes will then require greater federation capabilities between the different IP domains. In this draft we discuss Home Agent federation capabilities over Mobile IP so that inter-technology, inter-domain handovers are better supported.</t>
