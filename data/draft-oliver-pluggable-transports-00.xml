      <t>Pluggable Transports (PTs) are a mechanism enabling the rapid development and deployment of network traffic obfuscation techniques used to circumvent surveillance and censorship. This specification does not define or limit the techniques themselves, but rather focuses on the startup, shutdown, and inter-process communication mechanisms required to make these technologies interoperable with applications. This document is based heavily on [PT2.1].</t>
