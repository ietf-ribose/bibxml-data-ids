    <abstract>
      <t>The document attempts to establish the need for new authentication methods in the Internet of Things (IoT) as a future networking area beyond 5G going into 6G for standardization. Several scenarios are described where the current authentication protocols do not work or are insufficient. Next we discuss a few new approaches such as Wireless LAN/6G sensing and LED light based which can be further explored.</t>
