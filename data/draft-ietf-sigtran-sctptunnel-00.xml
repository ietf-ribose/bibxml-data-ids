      <t>The Simple Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [1] provides a standard method for transporting messages over IP, with features such as multi-homing and multi-stream built into the protocol for additional reliability and real-time delivery. This memo defines a method for tunneling SCTP over a single UDP port in order to simplify initial implementations. This memo is intended to become an Experimental document and is not intended as a standard of any kind.</t>
