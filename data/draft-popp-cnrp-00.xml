    <abstract>
      <t>People often refer to things in the world by a common name or phrase, e.g., a trade name, company name, or a book title. These names are sometimes easier for people to remember and enter than URLs; many people consider URLs hard to remember or type. This document proposes an abstract protocol for the resolution of common names. The protocol is based on XML, RDF and the Dublin Core metadata elements. The proposed mechanism allows for a very dynamic resolution process where the client has no predefined knowledge of the namespace or the resolution service. The protocol supports an extensible query and response interface with multiple independent XML vocabularies. Furthermore, it allows for multiple concrete implementations (HTTP, LDAP, WHOIS,...). Both the specifics of the query interface and the type of implementation can be discovered at runtime by the resolution client. This document is intended for discussion at the Common Name Resolution Protocol BOF (renamed from Human Friendly Identifier BOF). It may be discussed on cnrp-ietf@lists.internic.net.
