      <t>This memo proposes an alternative approach to the current ECN mechanismas proposed in the internet draft [draft-kksjf]. A Backward-ECN(BECN)is proposed which uses the existing IP signalling mechanism, theInternet Control Messaging Protocol (ICMP) [RFC 792] Source Quenchmessage. The use of ICMP Source Quench (ISQ) allows a basic ECNmechanism for IP which does not require any negotiation between endsystems. Congestion notification is kept at the network(IP) level. Thecongestion state can be reflected up to the transport layer (e.g. TCP orUDP) for appropriate action. The ISQ based approach reduces the reactiontime to a congestion in the network. In addition, the ISQ message caninclude information on the severity of the congestion allowing the endhost to react accordingly so as to make maximal use of the resourceswhile maintaining network equilibrium.</t>
