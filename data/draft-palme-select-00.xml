      <t>The SELECT protocol allows Internet users to supply their ratings ofInternet documents, and to use ratings provided by other users tofilter and select what to read In particular, SELECT supports so-calledcollaborative filtering. By this is meant that the filtering andselection for a particular user is made based on ratings provided byspecial groups of raters, such as peer groups, people with similarvalues, interests and expertise as the person for whom the selectingand filtering is done.The SELECT functionality is downwards compatible with PICS [PICS 1,PICS 2], but a major difference is that while PICS is mainly orientedtowards keeping out unsuitable information from children(blackballing), SELECT is mainly oriented towards helping people findthe best and most valuable information for them on the Internet(goldballing). A syntactical difference from PICS is that the encodingsin SELECT are using the XML encoding format.</t>
