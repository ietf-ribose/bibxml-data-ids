    <abstract>
      <t>The OAuth framework is a widely deployed authorization protocol standard that enables applications to obtain limited access to user resources. OAuth clients must be registered with the OAuth authorization server, which poses significant operational challenges in dynamically scaling environments. The Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE) is a graduated Cloud Native Compute Foundation project designed to dynamically attest and verify workload identity. This draft describes how workloads with SPIFFE credentials can be used with OAuth to lessen the operational burden of client registration through a "register on first use" principle.</t>
