    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents clarifications and corrections concerning features related to the use of location-related attributes in NFSv4.1. These include migration, which transfers responsibility for a file system from one server to another, and trunking which deals with the discovery and control of the set of network addresses to use to access a file system. The goal is to arrive at an appropriate set of updates to RFC5661.</t>
