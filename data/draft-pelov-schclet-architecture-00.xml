      <t>This draft introduces the concept of a SCHClet, a modular, atomic sub-function within the SCHC (Static Context Header Compression) framework. Drawing an analogy from chiplet technology in integrated circuits, a SCHClet is envisioned as a self-contained unit that encapsulates a specific SCHC function or set of functions. This modular approach allows for tailored implementations that can meet diverse use cases without the overhead of a full SCHC apparatus. By decomposing SCHC functionality into SCHClets, the framework becomes more adaptable, extensible, and easier to deploy generic network environments, applicable, but not limited to constrained networks. A technology which uses a SCHClet can be considered as built using the SCHC Framework. A generic SCHC Framework implementation which has all SCHClets implemented MUST be able to interoperate with any SCHClet, provided it has the corresponding configuration. For example, if one IPsec end-point uses a minimal SCHClet implementation, the other end-point may use a full SCHC implementation with the corresponding configuration. It may be said that a SCHClet is the minimal sub-function corresponding to a given SCHC Context. In this sense, we can see Ack-On-Err Fragmentation as a SCHClet. We may consider the Ack- Always Fragmentation as a SCHClet. Or we may consider the baseline fragmentations from RFC8724 (NoAck, AckAlways, AckOnErr) as a SCHClet, with the parameters defining which fragmentation mode is used. In any case, a developer may chose to use only the NoAck fragmentation (for example), and in this case they are using the NoAck Fragmentation SCHClet, which can even be further restricted to a fixed set of parameters, with different parameters unsupported by the implementation.</t>
