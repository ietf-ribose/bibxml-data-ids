      <t>Problem Statement for Secure End to End Privacy Enabled Mapping System for Identifier Locator separation systems is presented. Since identifiers are often carried in packet headers in clear, and mapping systems are often designed to be accessible by any entity, to preserve identifier's privacy, lookups to the mapping system should be allowed only by authorized entities. In mapping systems, in addition to privacy, security also requires special attention because of the caches introduced into the data path. Any denial of service attacks on the cache should not allow the communication to come to an end.</t>
