    <abstract>
      <t>The BGP4 protocol specifies the selection and propagation of a single best path for each prefix. As defined today BGP has no mechanisms to distribute paths other then best path between it's speakers. This behavior results in number of disadvantages for new applications and services. This document presents an alternative mechanism for solving the problem based on the concept of parallel route reflector planes. It also compares existing solutions and proposed ideas that enable distribution of more paths than just the best path. This proposal does not specify any changes to the BGP protocol definition. It does not require upgrades to provider edge or core routers nor does it need network wide upgrades. The authors believe that the GROW WG would be the best place for this work.</t>
