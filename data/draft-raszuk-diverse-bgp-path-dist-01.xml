      <t>The BGP4 protocol specifies the selection and propagation of a singlebest path for each prefix. As defined today BGP has no mechanisms todistribute paths other then best path between it's speakers. Thisbehavior results in number of disadvantages for new applications andservices.This document presents an alternative mechanism for solving theproblem based on the concept of parallel route reflector planes. Italso compares existing solutions and proposed ideas that enabledistribution of more paths than just the best path.This proposal does not specify any changes to the BGP protocoldefinition. It does not require upgrades to provider edge or corerouters nor does it need network wide upgrades. The authors believethat the GROW WG would be the best place for this work.</t>
