    <abstract>
      <t>A holistic directory system is described which translates a standard E.164 telephone number into the Internet address information required to support IP-enabled communications applications such as real-time voice, voice-messaging, fax or unified-messaging. The proposed system utilizes two logical control tiers to implement the translation. The first logical control tier is patterned after a Top Level Domain (TLD) of the Internet Domain Name System (DNS). This first-tier provides a mechanism for locating the appropriate directory within the second logical tier of the Internet-Telephony directory system where authoritative Internet address information is stored for a given E.164 number. This first-tier is expected to conform to the regulatory and operational standards defined by the Internet Corporation for the Assignment of Names and Numbers (ICANN) for the operation of top-level domains. The second logical control tier provides a mechanism for accessing and managing authoritative Internet address information associated with an E.164 number. This tier consists of widely distributed DNS servers controlled by service providers, and corporate network operators. Distributed ownership of the second tier directories allows organizations to control the Internet address information associated with the E.164 numbers under their day-to-day control.</t>
