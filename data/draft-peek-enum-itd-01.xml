      <t>A holistic directory system is described which translates a standardE.164 telephone number into the Internet address informationrequired to support IP-enabled communications applications such asreal-time voice, voice-messaging, fax or unified-messaging. Theproposed system utilizes two logical control tiers to implement thetranslation.The first logical control tier is patterned after a Top Level Domain(TLD) of the Internet Domain Name System (DNS). This first-tierprovides a mechanism for locating the appropriate directory withinthe second logical tier of the Internet-Telephony directory systemwhere authoritative Internet address information is stored for agiven E.164 number. This first-tier is expected to conform to theregulatory and operational standards defined by the InternetCorporation for the Assignment of Names and Numbers (ICANN) for theoperation of top-level domains.The second logical control tier provides a mechanism for accessingand managing authoritative Internet address information associatedwith an E.164 number. This tier consists of widely distributed DNSservers controlled by service providers, and corporate networkoperators. Distributed ownership of the second tier directoriesallows organizations to control the Internet address informationassociated with the E.164 numbers under their day-to-day control.</t>
