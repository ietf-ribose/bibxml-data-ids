      <t>ICP (see [RFC2186]) is a protocol allowing standardized communication management between caches. This document describes an extension to the ICP protocol whose aim is to reach the following three goals : - locating requested data more efficiently among a cache hierarchy, - reducing network traffic between caches by exchanging compressed data over different protocols, - offering a suitable protocol for the forthcoming techniques of push and intelligent prefetching.</t>
