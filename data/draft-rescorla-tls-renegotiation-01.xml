      <t>SSL and TLS renegotiation are vulnerable to an attack in which theattacker forms a TLS connection with the target server, injectscontent of his choice, and then splices in a new TLS connection froma client. The server treats the client's initial TLS handshake as arenegotiation and thus believes that the initial data transmitted bythe attacker is from the same entity as the subsequent client data.This draft defines a TLS extension to cryptographically tierenegotiations to the TLS connections they are being performed over,thus preventing this attack.</t>
