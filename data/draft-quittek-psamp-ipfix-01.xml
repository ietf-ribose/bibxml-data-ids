      <t>This memo discusses the relationship between the packet sampling (PSAMP) Working Group and the IP flow information export (IPFIX) Working Group. The goals of writing this memo are: avoiding duplication of work, increase mutual benefits between the groups, and harmonize the documents and standards developed by the groups. Therefore, potential overlap of both group's activities is analyzed, activities in both groups that potentially complement each other are pointed out, and common issues are listed that should be harmonized between the groups.</t>
