    <abstract>
      <t>This work explores what, in the parlance of the current CIP draft, is called an index type -- specifically, a new kind of index that merges indexing of hierarchically named attribute-value entities (such as in LDAP and RWHOIS) and ones without distinguished names (such as in WHOIS++). It is based on a previous version of the CIP specification, but that was just a convenient syntactical jumping off point. It is intended to be orthogonal to the FIND working group task of defining a framing syntax and functionality for a common indexing data wrapping protocol, and that the concepts and protocol elements in this draft should be able to be expressed in a manner consistent with the new CIP framework at the appropriate time.</t>
