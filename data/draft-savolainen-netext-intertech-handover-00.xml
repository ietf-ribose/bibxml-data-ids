      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is a network based mobility managementprotocol which provides IP mobility service to a host in a way whichis transparent to the host itself. This document analyses thescenarios in which a multi-interfaced Mobile Node roams in a ProxyMobile IPv6 domain which consists of access networks that are ofdifferent types. In order to support session continuity as theMobile Node moves between access networks within the PMIP6 domain,the Mobile Node either needs to use host based Mobile IP or beenhanced with various capabilities described in this document.</t>
