      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 [RFC5213] is a network based mobility management protocol which provides IP mobility service to a host in a way which is transparent to the host itself. This document analyses the scenarios in which a multi-interfaced Mobile Node roams in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain which consists of access networks that are of different types. In order to support session continuity as the Mobile Node moves between access networks within the PMIP6 domain, the Mobile Node either needs to use host based Mobile IP or be enhanced with various capabilities described in this document.</t>
