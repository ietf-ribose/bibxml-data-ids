      <t>This document discusses interaction of transition mechanisms thatcan be involved in a communication between two end-points. Varioustransition mechanisms are defined to solve single transition issues.They are supposed to be used once along the path of a singlecommunication. During the transition phase disparate networkarchitecture will introduce multiple transition mechanisms indifferent ways. It will not be possible to predict the number andthe nature of the transition mechanisms that can be encounteredalong the path of a communication. This memo aims to identify caseswhere multiple transition mechanisms can be involved, and what canbe the interaction effects between them.</t>
