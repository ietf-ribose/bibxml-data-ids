    <abstract>
      <t>This document discusses interaction of transition mechanisms that can be involved in a communication between two end-points. Various transition mechanisms are defined to solve single transition issues. They are supposed to be used once along the path of a single communication. During the transition phase disparate network architecture will introduce multiple transition mechanisms in different ways. It will not be possible to predict the number and the nature of the transition mechanisms that can be encountered along the path of a communication. This memo aims to identify cases where multiple transition mechanisms can be involved, and what can be the interaction effects between them.</t>
