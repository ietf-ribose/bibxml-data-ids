      <t>DMARC assumes the From header field has the combined role of Author and Sender or that it shares the same domain as that of the Sender. Message delivery becomes unreliable and the Author role may be supplanted as services adapt to DMARC's incompatible policies affecting otherwise valid and well formed messages. This document recommends two methods to allow DMARC to be compatible with RFC5322.</t>
