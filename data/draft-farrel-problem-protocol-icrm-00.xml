      <t>Procedures in place and currently being developed within the IETFencourage the development and agreement of clear requirements beforethe new protocols or protocol extensions are accepted as work items.This does not preclude nor prohibit individuals from engaging in suchprotocol work outside of the IETF, but it acknowledges thatacceptance of the work may be subject to proving the requirementsthrough a requirements document or through deployment and usageexperience. That work within the IETF on a requirements document maychange the underlying assumptions made by protocol developers andthereby render their work obsolete or risible is a risk taken by allwho spend their time enhancing the set of available protocols withoutfirst agreeing the requirements.At the same time, some problem statements or requirement documentsare very narrowly scoped to address a very specific need. There is arisk that the development of a solution to such a precise problem maybe non-extensible and may make the protocol unusable in a widercontext.This document examines the need to avoid tying new protocoldevelopments too tightly to the problem statement or requirementdocuments. It uses an example from the ITU ASON requirements forsignaling protocols within optical networks to illustrate howadhering to the requirements statement too zealously mayunnecessarily restrict the applicability of the protocol in a widercontext.</t>
