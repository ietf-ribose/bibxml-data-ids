      <t>The Dynamic Home Agent Address Discovery (DHAAD) mechanism isdescribed in the Mobile IPv6 specification. This mechanism ismandatory in any compliant Mobile IPv6 implementation and so in anyMIPv6 based protocols too. On the other hand, DHAAD was the only onemechanism to discover a potential Home Agent for a Mobile Node in thepast. This is no longer the case today. This document analyzes thesecurity of the different existing home agent discovery mechanismsand promotes the remove of DHAAD from the future Mobile IPv6standard, in light of this security analysis.</t>
