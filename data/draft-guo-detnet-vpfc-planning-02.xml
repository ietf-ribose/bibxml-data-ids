      <t>The cycle-based queuing and forwarding mechanisms are an effective method to ensure that the transmission has a definite upper bound of jitter, as well as latency. The prerequisite for this method is to ensure that queuing resources do not conflict. In scaling deterministic networks, how to avoid the queuing resources conflict of this method is an open problem. This document proposes the information model of planning virtue periodic forwarding channel (VPFC) based on virtual periodic forwarding path (VPFP). The solution can solve the queuing resources conflict of cycle-specified queuing and forwarding in nonlinear topology domain, ensuring the bounded latency of DetNet flow in the same periodic forwarding domain.</t>
