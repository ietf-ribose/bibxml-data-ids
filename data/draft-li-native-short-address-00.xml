      <t>This document specifies mechanisms of NSA (Native Short Address) that enables IP packet transmission over links where the transmission of a full length address may be wasteful. All descriptions will focus on carrying IP packets across LLN (Low power and Lossy Networks), those LLNs positioned as limited domains. The specifications include NSA allocation, routing with NSA, header format design including length- variable fields, and how to access full IPv6 networks.</t>
