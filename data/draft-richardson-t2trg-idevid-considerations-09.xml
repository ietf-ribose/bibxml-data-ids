      <t>This document provides a taxonomy of methods used by manufacturers of silicon and devices to secure private keys and public trust anchors. This deals with two related activities: how trust anchors and private keys are installed into devices during manufacturing, and how the related manufacturer held private keys are secured against disclosure. This document does not evaluate the different mechanisms, but rather just serves to name them in a consistent manner in order to aid in communication. RFCEDITOR: please remove this paragraph.
