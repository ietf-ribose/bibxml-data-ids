      <t>This document introduces a generic publish-subscribe protocol, that can be built on top of RELOAD or P2PP. It works both for the unstructured and DHT-based Peer-to-Peer networks. Moreover it is highly customizable to address the optimization issues and support different topology structures. It can be used to implement P2P-SIP services such as presence or event notification.</t>
