      <t>This document presents a base YANG Data model for connectionless OAM protocols. It provides a technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs for connectionless protocols. The Base model presented here can be extended to include technology specific details. This is leading to uniformity between OAM protocols and support nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different or same levels through a unified interface).</t>
