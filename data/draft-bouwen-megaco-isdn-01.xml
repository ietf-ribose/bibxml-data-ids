      <t>This document introduces the concept of an ISDN access gateway in the context of Megaco/H.248 and Sigtran protocols. For these ISDN access gateways, the ISDN B channels may be controlled by the Media Gateway Controller using megaco/H.248 while the User-to-Network signaling running over the D channels may be relayed to the Media Gateway Controller using either megaco/H.248 or the Sigtran protocols. The main issues involved are: * Megaco/H.248 and Sigtran protocols may interwork in different ways in ISDN access gateways, leaving room for non - interoperable solutions; * Megaco needs additional packages in order to support ISDN terminations in the ISDN access gateway; * A data service may be offered to ISDN users via the ISDN D- channel, introducing the need to introduce a NAS package for the D-channel. This document addresses these issues, proposes and explains different solutions and suggests best practice guideline for megaco / sigtran interworking in ISDN access gateways.</t>
