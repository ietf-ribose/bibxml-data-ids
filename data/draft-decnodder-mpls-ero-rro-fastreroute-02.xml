      <t>MPLS fast reroute [3] is considered as a possible solution to protecttraffic against link and node failures by re-directing the trafficlocally to a backup LSP. A backup LSP can be either a detour LSP or abypass tunnel. This document describes two methods to optimize therouting of detour LSPs such that they merge faster, a distributedmethod and a centralized method. The distributed method uses theBackup Record Route Object (BRRO) and the centralized method uses theBackup Explicit Route Object (BERO). The latter can also be used forbypass tunnels.</t>
