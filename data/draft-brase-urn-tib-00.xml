      <t>The German research agency (DFG) has started a project in 2004 to improve the access to primary data especially for interdisciplinary data use. Publications of primary data should be citable as publications so that the data set may be cited together with the author when being used further. By this, scientific primary data should not be exclusively understood as part of a scientific publication, but may have its own identity. The data records remain at their research institutes, but the metadata records will be stored at the German national library of Science and Technology (TIB) as a central registration agency, the data records are identified with a DOI as a persistent identifier. In cooperation with the German Library the data record shall also be registered with an urn.</t>
