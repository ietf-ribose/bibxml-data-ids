    <abstract>
      <t>A slice aggregate is a collection of packets that match a slice policy selection criteria and are given the same forwarding treatment. Slice Aggregate aware Traffic Engineering (SA-TE) is a mechanism that facilitates Traffic Engineering (TE) path selection to take into account the available network resources associated with a specific slice aggregate. This document specifies the Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) extensions for support of SA-TE. This includes the generalization of the semantics of a number of IGP extensions already defined for existing MPLS Traffic Engineering in [RFC3630], [RFC4124], [RFC5305] and additional IGP extensions beyond those.</t>
