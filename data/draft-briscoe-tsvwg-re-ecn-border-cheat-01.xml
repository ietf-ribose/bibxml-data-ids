      <t>Scaling per flow admission control to the Internet is a hard problem.A recently proposed approach combines Diffserv and pre-congestionnotification (PCN) to provide a service slightly better than Intservcontrolled load. It scales to networks of any size, but only ifdomains trust each other to comply with admission control and ratepolicing. This memo claims to solve this trust problem withoutlosing scalability. It describes bulk border policing that providesa sufficient emulation of per-flow policing with the help of anotherrecently proposed extension to ECN, involving re-echoing ECN feedback(re-ECN). With only passive bulk measurements at borders, sanctionscan be applied against cheating networks.</t>
