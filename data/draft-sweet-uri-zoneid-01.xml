      <t>This document describes how the zone identifier of an IPv6 scoped address, defined as &lt;zone_id&gt; in the IPv6 Scoped Address Architecture (RFC 4007), can be represented in a literal IPv6 address and in a Uniform Resource Identifier that includes such a literal address. It documents a long-standing usage of the IPvFuture extension point provided in the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) syntax specification [RFC3986]. [ Editor's note: This draft documents the IPvFuture format originally defined in [LITERAL-ZONE] and used by CUPS since 2005. A separate, incompatible format was defined and published in RFC 6874. ]</t>
