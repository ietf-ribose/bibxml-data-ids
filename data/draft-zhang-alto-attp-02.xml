    <abstract>
      <t>Currently P2P applications have accounts for large cross-ISP traffic. This document proposes a method to reduce cross-ISP traffic by setting cooperative ISP-friendly trackers in the ISP's network. Through improving the random node selection mechanism in P2P tracker-based application, we can effectively reduce cross-ISP traffic as well as the cost of network equipments and network operation. Conventions used in this document In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and server respectively. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].</t>
