      <t>Currently P2P applications have accounts for large cross-ISP traffic. This document proposes a method to reduce cross-ISP traffic by setting cooperative ISP-friendly trackers in the ISP's network. Through improving the random node selection mechanism in P2P tracker-based application, we can effectively reduce cross-ISP traffic as well as the cost of network equipments and network operation.
