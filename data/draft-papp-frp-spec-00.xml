      <t>Firewalls are used to get controlled and secure connection between networks, e.g. a company's internal network and the Internet. Preferably the firewall is the only link between the networks to be able to guarantee a certain level of security. The firewall is a critical node in the network and if it would fail the result is lost connection between the networks. To ensure reliability and connectivity we add redundancy, i.e. a number of parallel firewalls are installed which will act as backups for each other.</t>
