    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a framework for the use of the Certificate Transparency (CT) protocol for publicly logging the existence of Secure Telephone Identity (STI) certificates as they are issued or observed, in a manner that allows anyone to audit STI certification authority (CA) activity and notice the issuance of suspect certificates as well as to audit the certificate logs themselves. The intent is establish a level of trust in the STI eco-system that verification of calls would required and refuse to honor STI certificates that do not appear in a log, effectively forcing STI CAs to add all issued certificates to the logs, establishing trust that STI certificates are unique to the authorized provider or assignee of a telephone number resource. The primary role of certificate transparency in the STI ecosystem is the avoidance of issuance of unauthorized or duplicate provider level certificates or, of particular importance, telephone number level delegate certificates. This provides a robust mechanism for the detection of unauthorized creation of certificate credentials for illegitimate spoofing of telephone numbers.</t>
