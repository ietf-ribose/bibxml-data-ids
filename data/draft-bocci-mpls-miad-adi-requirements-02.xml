      <t>This draft specifies requirements for indicators in the MPLS label stack to support ancillary data in the packet and high level requirements on that ancillary data. This work is the product of the IETF MPLS Open Design Team. Requirements are derived from a number of new proposals for additions to the MPLS label stack to allow forwarding or other processing decisions to be made, either by a transit or terminating LSR (i.e. the LER), based on application data that may be in or below the bottom of the label stack.</t>
