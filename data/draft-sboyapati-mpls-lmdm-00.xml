      <t>MPLS is the heart and soul of the service provider network. MPLS can carryany data payload which gives the flexibility to the service provider to provision newservice with any expense. As loss and delay sensitive applications such as Voice and Video arerunning on MPLS network, they may suffer delays in packet transmission and delivery. So Voice and Video trafficon MPLS network needs low loss and delay LSP's to transfer Voice and Video packets.This draft is proposing a solution to selection of Low loss and latency LSP's forVoice and Video applications using MPLS Loss and Delay measurement parameters.The benefit of this technology results in delivery voice and video packets withbest possible lsp i.e. LSP's with less loss and delay.</t>
