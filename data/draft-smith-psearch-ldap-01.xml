      <t>This document defines two controls that extend the LDAPv3 [LDAP] searchoperation to provide a simple mechanism by which an LDAP client canreceive notification of changes that occur in an LDAP server. Themechanism is designed to be very flexible yet easy for clients andservers to implement. Since the IETF is likely to pursue a different,more comprehensive solution in this area, this document will eventuallybe published with Informational status in order to document an existingpractice.</t>
