      <t>This extension to IODEF (RFC 5070) is designed to aid in the sharing and dissemination of digital forensics information. The goal is to allow a tool independent format to share information between organizations focused on digital forensics: drive images, file carving, metadata, and related hashes. As with IODEF and its extensions, it is defined using XML.</t>
