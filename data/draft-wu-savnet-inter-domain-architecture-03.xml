    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents an inter-domain SAVNET architecture that serves as a comprehensive framework for the development of inter- domain source address validation (SAV) mechanisms. The proposed architecture empowers AS to generate SAV rules by leveraging SAV- specific Information communicated between ASes, and during the incremental/partial deployment of the SAV-specific Information, it can leverage the general information such as the routing information from the RIB to generate the SAV table when the SAV-specific Information for an AS's prefixes are not available. Instead of delving into protocol extensions or implementations, this document primarily focuses on proposing the SAV-specific Information and general information for deploying an inter-domain SAV mechanism, and defining the architectural components and interconnections between them for generating the SAV table.</t>
