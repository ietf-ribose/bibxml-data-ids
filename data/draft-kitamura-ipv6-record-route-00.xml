      <t>This document proposes a 'Record Route for IPv6 (RR6)' mechanism. Itis composed of one new IPv6 hop-by-hop option (RR6 option) extension.The RR6 mechanism is redesigned to establish an optimized recordroute mechanism for IPv6. Two types of new features are introduced.1. In order to prevent scalability problems and to make the mechanismflexible, the beginning and ending points of the data recording rangeare controlled by using their specifiers.2. In order to record long IPv6 addresses efficiently, a simpleaddress compression method is introduced. Since the compression isachieved by utilizing characteristics of recorded IPv6 addresseseffectively, the mechanism is efficient and optimized for IPv6.</t>
