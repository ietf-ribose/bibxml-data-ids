      <t>The objective of this document is to define and formalize the use ofIP-based VLAN switching in the context of virtualization of networkservices. Networking infrastructure appliances may host multiplevirtual instances of network services. IP address inspection on apacket coming from an external network such as the Internet can beused to switch the packet into a VLAN, through use of VLAN tags onEthernet frames. The tagged frame is subsequently fed to a VLAN-awarenetworking infrastructure appliance where the packet is directed to avirtualized service instance. This method of IP-based VLAN switchingon a packet assists in hosting multiple virtual instances of networkservices on servers and other appliances.</t>
