    <abstract>
      <t>Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) aims at evolving the way network operators design, deploy and provision their networks by leveraging on standard IT virtualisation technologies to move and consolidate a wide range of network functions and services onto industry standard high volume servers, switches and storage. The primary target for operators, stimulated by the recent updates on NFV and SDN, is the network edge. In fact, operators are considering their future datacentres and Points of Presence (PoPs) as increasingly dynamic infrastructures where Virtualised Network Functions (VNFs) and on-demand chained services with high elasticity will be deployed. This document presents an orchestration framework for automated deployment of highly available VNF chains. Resiliency of VNFs and chained services is a key requirement for operators to improve, ease, automate and speed up services lifecycle management. The proposed VNFs orchestration framework is also positioned with respect to current NFV and Service Function Chaining (SFC) architectures and solutions.</t>
