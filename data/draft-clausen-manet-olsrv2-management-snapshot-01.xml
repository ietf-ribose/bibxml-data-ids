    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes how Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are typically managed, in terms of pre-deployment management, as well as rationale and means of monitoring and management of MANET routers running the routing protocol OLSRv2 and its constituent protocol NHDP. Apart from pre-deployment management for setting up IP addresses and security related credentials, OLSRv2 only needs routers to agree one single parameter (called "C"). Other parameters for tweaking network performance may be determined during operation of the network, and need not be the same in all routers. This, using MIB modules and related management protocols such as SNMP (or possibly other, less "chatty", protocols). In addition, for debugging purposes, monitoring data and performance related counters can be sent to the Network Management Station (NMS) via standardized management protocols.</t>
