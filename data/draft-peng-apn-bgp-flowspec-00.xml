    <abstract>
      <t>A Flow Specification is an n-tuple consisting of several matching criteria that can be applied to IP traffic. Application-aware Networking (APN) is a framework, where APN data packets convey APN attribute (incl. APN ID and/or APN Parameters). The dynamic Flow Spec mechanism for APN is designed for the new applications of traffic filtering in an APN domain as well as the traffic control and actions on the policy enforcement points in this domain. These applications require coordination among the ASes within a service provider. This document specifies a new BGP Flow Spec Component Type in order to support APN traffic filtering. The match field is the APN ID. It also specifies traffic filtering actions to enable the creation of the APN ID in the outer tunnel encapsulation when matched to the corresponding Flow Spec rules.</t>
