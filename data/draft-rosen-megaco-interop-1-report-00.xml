      <t>An interoperability test of the Megaco (RFC2885/6) protocol was held on August 28-31 in Durham, NH. An excellent turnout of many different independently developed implementations were present, and a great many of the tests were quite successful, including media flow in many cases, and several cases of testing a Media Gateway controller from one organization with two Media Gateways from different organizations. The primary purpose of the event was to assess the ability of independent development teams to create interoperable devices from the recent Proposed Standard RFCs 2885 [1] and 2886 [2]. While several discrepancies were found that resulted from differing interpretations of the documents, the level of compatibility exhibited at this first test was excellent. A secondary purpose of the event was to begin the process of moving the RFCs to draft standard status, which requires documentation of at least two implementations of each protocol element/feature. While this first event only used a subset of the protocol, quite a few of the elements and features were demonstrated by all implementations. This I-D describes the event and summarized the results.</t>
