      <t>This document defines a reference architecture for a VPLS system. It describes possible VPLS architectures based on this reference architecture and the merits of each. Each VPLS architecture is described in terms of its logical components and their relationship to each other, as well as the mapping of these logical components to physical network elements. By understanding these logical components, which are fundamental building blocks for any VPLS system, one can easily compare different VPLS architectures and understand the pros and cons of each. A VPLS system may support one or more of these architectures simultaneously.</t>
