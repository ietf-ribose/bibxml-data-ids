      <t>Implementation of IoT systems imposes a requirement of M2M semantic interoperability. This problem is addressed by a number of ongoing attempts to define and standardize IoT information and data models. At present this work is fragmented across several standards with different approaches, scope, objectives, terminology, and assumptions that makes them difficult to understand and compare. This document is part of the effort to alleviate that problem by means of more streamlined presentations and descriptions. We are advocating for clear articulation of the intent and implicit or explicit assumptions in SDO specifications using the common terminology. Such clarifications would aid IoT practitioners and potential adopters to make meaningful comparisons and facilitate selection of IoT specifications that are the best fit for their intended purpose. To that end, we propose that creators of IoT standards address a list of questions that would characterize their work in comparable ways, somewhat akin to the intent of nutrition labels for food. This paper describes the basic design principles and practices of IoT information and data model definitions, and proposes an initial list of questions that SDOs may address to facilitate understanding and comparisons. Our intent is to evolve and refine this list over time by actively soliciting and incorporating feedback and suggestions of IoT community.</t>
