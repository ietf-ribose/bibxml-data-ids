      <t>The Authenticated-Enveloped-Data Content Type allows for the use ofAuthenticated-Enveloped modes with block cipher algorithms. At thetime of the original design there was discussion about the relativelocation of the authenticated attributes and the encrypted content inthe ASN.1 structure. With the benefits of implementation experienceI revisit the discussion made at the time and re-evaluate thedecision made.</t>
