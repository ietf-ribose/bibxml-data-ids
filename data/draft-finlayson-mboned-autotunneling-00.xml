      <t>Many Internet users currently cannot participate in wide-area IP multicast sessions, because their first-hop routers (or beyond) do not support IP multicast routing. We describe an application level (UDP-based) tunneling mechanism that allows non-multicast-connected users - with no modification to their operating systems - to automatically receive a large class of multicast sessions, pending the deployment of multicast in their upstream routers.</t>
