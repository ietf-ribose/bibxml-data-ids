      <t>Many Internet users currently cannot participate in wide-area IPmulticast sessions, because their first-hop routers (or beyond) do notsupport IP multicast routing. We describe an application level(UDP-based) tunneling mechanism that allows non-multicast-connectedusers - with no modification to their operating systems - toautomatically receive a large class of multicast sessions, pending thedeployment of multicast in their upstream routers.</t>
