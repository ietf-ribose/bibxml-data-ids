      <t>This document defines identity modules based on Secure Elements processing DTLS/TLS stacks for CoAP devices. The expected benefits of these secure microcontrollers are the following : - Secure storage of pre-share keys or private keys - Trusted simple or mutual authentication between CoAP devices and CoAP clients. - The device identity is enforced by a non cloneable chip. - Trusted cryptographic support. - Low power consumption for DTLS/TLS processing.</t>
