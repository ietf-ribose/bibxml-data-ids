      <t>This document defines OODA-HTTP, a protocol extension and adaptive security framework that applies the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) loop to HTTP/HTTPS communications. Each HTTP request is transformed into an observation signal, a decision vector, and an opportunity for active defense. OODA-HTTP extends the traditional 4-phase loop into 7 phases: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act, Memorize, Adjust, and Cooperate - allowing systems to evolve and adapt during communication. The protocol introduces a structured header, 'OODA-Action', that carries context-driven actions between endpoints. OODA-HTTP offers compatibility with existing infrastructure (e.g., TLS, HTTP/2/3), while enabling resilience against classical, behavioral, and quantum threats. It supports inter-protocol cooperation with DOTS, STAMP, SIEMs, and behavioral inference engines such as SVDD and PSLPSO. This document defines protocol behavior, header format, core logic, and interoperability strategy.</t>
