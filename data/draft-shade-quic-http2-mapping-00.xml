      <t>The QUIC transport protocol has several features that are desirable in a transport for HTTP/2, such as stream multiplexing, per-stream flow control, and low-latency connection establishment. This document describes a mapping of HTTP/2 semantics over QUIC. Specifically, this document identifies HTTP/2 features that are subsumed by QUIC, and describes how the other features can be implemented atop QUIC.</t>
