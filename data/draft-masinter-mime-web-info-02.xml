      <t>This document describes some of the ways in which parts of the MIMEsystem, originally designed for electronic mail, have been used inthe Web, and some of the ways in which those uses have resulted indifficulties. Given this background and justification, this documentthen goes on to outline requirements for changes to MIME registriesand practices for their use within W3C and IETF, in order to addressthose difficulties. Within IETF, it is expected that a companionBest Current Practice document will make specific changes to theInternet Media Types and Charset registries, among others.</t>
