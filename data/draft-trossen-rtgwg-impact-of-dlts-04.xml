    <abstract>
      <t>This document discusses the impact of distributed ledger technologies being realized over IP-based provider networks. The focus here lies on the impact that the DLT communication patterns have on efficiency of resource usage in the underlying networks. We provide initial insights into experimental results to quantify this impact in terms of inefficient and wasted communication, aligned along challenges that the DLT realization over IP networks faces. This document intends to outline this impact but also opportunities for network innovations to improve on the identified impact as well as the overall service quality. While this document does not promote specific solutions that capture those opportunities, it invites the wider community working on DLT and network solutions alike to contribute to the insights in this document to aid future research and development into possible solution concepts and technologies. The findings presented here have first been reported within the similarly titled whitepaper released by the Industry IoT Consortium (IIC) [IIC_whitepaper].</t>
