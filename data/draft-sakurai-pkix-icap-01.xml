    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides a sub set of specifications how to issue, publish X.509 certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs). It also provides the certificate validation service by online. In the proposed specifications, the World Wide Web (WWW) is used for secure distributing certificates across a firewall in both human and machine readable syntax. These specifications define not only the protocols between the PKI clients and a single CA, but also the protocols between the CAs. With the CA-CA communications, the PKI clients can retrieve any certificates and CRLs without specifying the location of the appropriate CA, by only asking to the neighbor CA.</t>
