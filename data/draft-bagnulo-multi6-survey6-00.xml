      <t>This document presents proposed solutions and tools related to IPv6 multi-homing. All presented proposals respect actual IPv6 routing architecture and current ISP address aggregation scheme, in particular, avoiding route injection to the DFZ. Besides, only network and transport level solutions are introduced, meaning that application level solutions are intentionally excluded.</t>
