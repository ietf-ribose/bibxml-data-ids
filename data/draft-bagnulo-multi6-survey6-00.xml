      <t>This document presents proposed solutions and tools related to IPv6multi-homing. All presented proposals respect actual IPv6 routingarchitecture and current ISP address aggregation scheme, inparticular, avoiding route injection to the DFZ. Besides, onlynetwork and transport level solutions are introduced, meaning thatapplication level solutions are intentionally excluded.</t>
