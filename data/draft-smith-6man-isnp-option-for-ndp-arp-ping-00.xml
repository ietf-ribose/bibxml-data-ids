      <t>IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) and IPv4 Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) can be used to perform "ping" tests that overcome nodes' refusal to respond to IPv6 and IPv4 ICMP Echo Requests. A drawback is that NDP and ARP do not carry an Identification, Sequence Number and Payload for these ping tests. This memo proposes an IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Option that adds these fields to the NDP and ARP packets used to perform ping tests.</t>
