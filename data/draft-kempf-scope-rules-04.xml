      <t>RFC 2608, RFC 2610, and RFC 2614 provide rules for configuring SLPagents with scopes and DAs from the protocol, DHCP, and API view-points, respectively. The rules presented in these three documents,while not in conflict, are ambiguous in certain cases. There arealso cases that fall into the cracks between the three documents.For example, if the mandatory byte is off in DHCP for scopes andthere are no statically configured scopes, but there are DHCPscopes, should an agent use the DHCP scopes or not? This documentspecifies a sequence of steps that interoperable implementations ofSLP must follow in order to obtain a clear and unambiguous scope andDA configuration.</t>
