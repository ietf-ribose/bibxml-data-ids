      <t>This document reviews the certificate validation procedure specified in RFC6487 and highlights aspects of operational management of certificates in the RPKI in response to the movement of resources across registries, and the associated actions of Certification Authorities to maintain certification of resources during this movement. The document describes an alternative validation procedure that reduces the operational impact of certificate management during resource movement.</t>
