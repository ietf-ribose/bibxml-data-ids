      <t>While TCP has enjoyed many enhancements over the decades, it isuseful to allow applications to use new transports, such as SCTP. Itis inefficient to naively probe the server using the new transportprotocol. This document proposes a new DNS resource record whichprovides an efficient way to query which protocols are supported by aserver. The presence of this record will allow the client to avoidthe excessive probing.</t>
