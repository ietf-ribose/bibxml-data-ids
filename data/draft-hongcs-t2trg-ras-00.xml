      <t>An efficient resource allocation scheme directly affects the overallsystem's network utilization, and notably, the wireless resource suchas bandwidth is itself an expensive commodity. In this regards, toaddress the requirement of massively increased IoT traffic at theedge, as a solution approach, a number of small cell base stations(SBSs) have been deployed with certain computational capabilities.However, it is still limited, and any inappropriate resourceallocation scheme for the associated nodes with trafficcharacterized by ultra-reliability and low-latency (URLLC)requirements can impact the system's resource utilization andperformance. Considering a reserve resource for such kind of traffic,the resource allocation problem in each time slot behaves as a nodeselection problem with contention amongst active nodes for theresource. In this paper, we have formulated this as an index problem,and with simulation results have shown that the cumulative reward interms of network utility is maximized following this approach.</t>
