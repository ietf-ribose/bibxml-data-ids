      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it defines Textual Conventions to represent commonly used Path Computation Element (PCE) management information. The intent is that these TEXTUAL CONVENTIONS (TCs) will be imported and used in PCE related MIB modules to avoid duplicating conventions.
