    <abstract>
      <t>In-network computing breaks the end-to-end principle and introduces new challenges to the transport layer functionalities. This draft provides the background of a suite of RPC-based applications which can take advantage of INC support, surveys the existing transport protocols to show they are insufficient or improper to be used in this context, and lays out the requirements to develop a general transport protocol tailored for such applications. The purpose of this draft is to help understand the problem domain and inspire the design and development a unified INC transport protocol.</t>
