      <t>The objective of this draft is to clarify a framework forstandardizing the mechanisms supporting interoperable network-basedvirtual private networks (NBVPNs). These are VPNs using IPfacilities whose operation mechanisms are implemented within anetwork (or networks) and outsourced to one or more serviceproviders.This draft first describes the assumed services of NBVPNs andclarifies the logical architecture model and reference model ofNBVPN. Considering the assumed services, this draft furtherclarifies the NBVPN requirements for interfaces and MIBs in thereference model. It also surveys and discusses current technologiessupporting NBVPNs such as tunneling, VPN identifier, routing, andQoS/SLA. Additionally it will, in future, provide outline of theinterface and MIB specifications and present criteria for achievinginteroperability.</t>
