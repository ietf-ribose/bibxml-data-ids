      <t>This draft discusses the motivation for MPLS OAM functionality and possible requirements for OAM in MPLS networks. Examples of OAM functions include support for fault management, continuity checks, loopbacks, performance monitoring and protection switching. Such capabilities may be useful in many applications of MPLS networks, but a detailed set of requirements is currently not available. Further discussion and input is solicited, in particular from network operators and service providers.</t>
