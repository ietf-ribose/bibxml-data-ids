      <t>This document proposes the redistribution extended community. This new extended community allows a router to influence how a specific route should be redistributed towards a specified set of eBGP speakers. Several types of redistribution communities are proposed. The first type may be used to indicate that a specific route should not be announced over a specified set of eBGP sessions. The second type may be used to indicate that the attached route should only be announced with the NO_EXPORT community over the specified set of eBGP sessions and the third type may be used to indicate that the attached route should be prepended n times when announced over a specified set of eBGP sessions.</t>
