      <t>Pre-Congestion Notification [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-architecture] approach proposes Admission Control to limit the amount of real-time PCN traffic to a configured level during the normal operating conditions, and Flow Termination used to tear-down some of the flows to bring the PCN traffic level down to a desirable amount during unexpected events such as network failures, with the goal of maintaining the QoS assurances to the remaining flows. Preliminary performance evaluation results on example admission and termination mechanisms were presented in [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-phb] and in earlier versions of this draft. This draft presents the results of a follow-up simulation study.</t>
