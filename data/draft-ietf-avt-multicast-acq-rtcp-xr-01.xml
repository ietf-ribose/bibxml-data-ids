      <t>In most RTP-based multicast applications, the RTP source sends inter-related data. Due to this interdependency, randomly joining RTPreceivers usually cannot start consuming the multicast data rightafter they join the session. Thus, they often experience a randomacquisition delay. One approach to reduce this delay is to use anauxiliary unicast RTP session with a retransmission server to receivea burst stream that facilitates rapid acquisition of the multicaststream. An RTP receiver may use this approach (or any otherapproach) to achieve rapid acquisition. Yet, due to various factors,performance of the rapid acquisition methods usually varies.Furthermore, in some cases the RTP receiver may (or may have to) do asimple multicast join. For quality reporting, monitoring anddiagnostics purposes, it is important to collect detailed informationfrom the RTP receivers about their acquisition and presentationexperiences. This document addresses this issue by defining a newreport block type, called Multicast Acquisition (MA) Report Block,within the framework of RTP Control Protocol (RTCP) Extended Reports(XR). This document also defines the necessary signaling of the newMA report block type in the Session Description Protocol (SDP).</t>
