      <t>TCP congestion control is based on the assumption that the end-to-endpath of a connection changes only insignificantly after connectionestablishment. Network layer mobility protocols that change aconnection's point of attachment transparently to the transport layermay violate this assumption and cause TCP to make congestion controldecisions based on invalid information. This document describes aTCP option that allows a connection endpoint to inform a peer when itchanges location. This document also outlines the proper congestioncontrol behavior that should take place in the face of such networklayer mobility.</t>
