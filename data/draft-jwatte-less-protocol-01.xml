      <t>Virtual worlds, typically implemented as multi-user sharedsimulations, are becoming increasingly used for serious work inaddition to the traditional uses of research and entertainment.Whereas previous distributed simulation protocols have been designedwith narrow, time-definite scope, the LESS (Live Entity State Stream)protocol is designed to allow open-ended join and leave for amultitude of simulation peers.
