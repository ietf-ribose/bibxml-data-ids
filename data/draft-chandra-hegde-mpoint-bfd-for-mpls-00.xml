      <t>Recent proposals have extended the use of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection to detect data plane failures in multipoint networks. One desirable application of Multipoint BFD [MP-BFD] is to detect data path failures in point-to-multipoint Label Switched Paths (P2MP LSPs). The scope of this document is to discuss the applicability of multipoint BFD for fault detection in the data plane of P2MP LSPs. The document extends the techniques and mechanisms mentioned in [RFC5884] and applies them to MPLS P2MP environment.</t>
