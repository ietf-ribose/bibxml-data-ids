      <t>I2RS intends to be a standard, programmatic interface to the routing system that guides traffic in the network. A well designed Traffic Steering (TS) solution can fully use the network bandwidth, reduce the network congestion and satisfy the performance (e.g., delay, loss) requirement of applications. Most of the existing TS solutions need human intervention and are lack of dynamic feedback and self- adjust ability. This document describes use cases that leverage the I2RS interface to perform traffic steering dynamically and automatically.</t>
