      <t>This document specifies how to interconnect multiple Transparent Interconnection of Lots of links (TRILL) sites with an intervening MPLS network using existing TRILL and VPLS standards. This draft addresses two problems as follows: 1) Providing connection between more than two TRILL sites that are separated by MPLS provider network. 2) Providing a single logical virtualized TRILL network for different tenants that are separated by an MPLS provider network.</t>
