      <t>This document proposes a solution for Service Network discovery and selection that could be implemented within the existing EAP specification framework. The purpose of Service Network discovery and selection here is to help a WLAN client using EAP for authentication to decide whether or not to connect to a WLAN Access Network, and help it select the most appropriate Mediating Network as a next hop for routing AAA packets in roaming situations where the WLAN Access Network has agreements with more than one Mediating Network affiliated with the clientâ€™s Home Service Network. The proposed solution has 3 components: a delivery mechanism for conveying Access Network and Service Network Information to a WLAN client, a data model/syntax for structuring the information in a generic manner, and a method by which the WLAN client can indicate its selection to the WLAN Access Network.</t>
