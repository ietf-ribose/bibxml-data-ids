      <t>Alternate-Marking (coloring) provides a method to perform packet loss, delay, and jitter measurements on live traffic. At the same time, on-path telemetry techniques are used to enable the collection and correlation of performance information to further support autonomous network operations. However, network operators still face the challenge of inband flow identification in large scale deployment. This document addresses the problems by introducing the real network scenarios, and proposes the requirements of supporting inband flow learning of flow information telemetry.</t>
