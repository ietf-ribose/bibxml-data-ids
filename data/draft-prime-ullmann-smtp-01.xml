      <t>This memo describes an update to the SMTP protocol, and to the format of an Internet mail message, to provide support for the character sets used in the world's many languages. This memo documents existing usage as well as specifying some additional interoperability refinements. It updates RFCs 821, 822, and 1090. The Internet is no longer a creature of the United States, much less of DARPA (the US Defence Advance Research Projects Agency). It is now an international network, and the ability to communicate in any of the world languages on an equal footing is an imperative.</t>
