    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a broadcast-oriented, many-to-many Defined- trust Transport (DeftT) framework that makes it simple to express and enforce application and deployment specific integrity, authentication, access control and behavior constraints directly in the protocol stack. DeftT's communication model is one of synchronized collections of secured information rather than one-to- one optionally secured connections. DeftT is part of a Defined-trust Communications approach with a specific example implementation available. Combined with IPv6 multicast and modern hardware-based methods for securing keys and code, it provides an easy to use foundation for secure and efficient communications in Limited Domains (RFC8799), in particular for Operational Technology (OT) networks.</t>
