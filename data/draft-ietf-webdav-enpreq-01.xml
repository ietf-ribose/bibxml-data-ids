      <t>This document describes the requirements for an Event Notification Protocol. The objective is to provide a simple, scalable and highly efficient notification protocol while also providing the appropriate flexibility to meet the needs of both the Internet and enterprise environments. Intent of this document is to collect all notification requirements in one place and leverage the work already done in other working groups. This document is one of a set of documents which together describe all aspects of a new Event Notification Protocol (ENP). ENP is an application level protocol that can be used for distributed event notification. The full set of ENP documents include: (1). Requirements for Event Notification Protocol (2). Model and Semantics Event Notification Protocol (3). Protocol Specification for Event Notification Protocol (4). Rationale for the Structure and Model for the Event Notification Protocol</t>
