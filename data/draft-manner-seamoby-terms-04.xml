      <t>There is a need for common definitions of terminology in the work to be done around IP mobility. This memo defines terms for mobility related terminology. It is intended as a living document for use by the Seamoby working group, and especially for use in Seamoby drafts and in WG discussions. Other working groups dealing with mobility may also take advantage of this terminology</t>
