      <t>Payloads carried over a Softwire mesh service as defined by BGPEncapsulation Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) informationexchange often carry a number of identifiable, distinct flows. Itcan in some circumstances be desirable to distribute these flows overthe equal cost multiple paths (ECMPs) that exist in the packetswitched network. Currently, the payload of a packet entering theSoftwire can only be interpreted by the ingress and egress routers.Thus the load balancing decision of a core router is only based onthe encapsulating header, presenting much less entropy than availablein the payload or the encapsulated header since the Softwireencapsulation acts in a tunneling fashion. This document describes amethod for achieving comparable load balancing efficiency in anetwork carrying Softwire mesh service over Layer Two TunnelingProtocol - Version 3 (L2TPv3) over IP or Generic RoutingEncapsulation (GRE) encapsulation to what would be achieved withoutsuch encapsulation.</t>
