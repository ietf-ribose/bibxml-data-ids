      <t>This document looks at a number of issues surrounding the need for network address translation (NAT) when IPsec is used to create virtual private networks (NAT). This document only looks at simple VPNs. That is VPNs consisting of a single IPsec tunnel as compared to VPNs consisting of chained and/or nested IPsec tunnels and/or transports.</t>
