      <t>The Generic Security Services API (GSSAPI) uses name-based authorization. GSSAPI authenticates two named parties to each other. Names can be stored on access control lists to make authorization decisions. Advances in security mechanisms require this model to be extended. Some mechanisms such as public-key mechanisms do not have a single name to be used. Other mechanisms such as Kerberos allow names to change as people move around organizations. This document proposes expanding the definition of GSSAPI names to deal with these situations.</t>
