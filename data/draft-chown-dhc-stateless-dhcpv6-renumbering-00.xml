      <t>IPv6 hosts using Stateless Address Autoconfiguration are able toautomatically configure their IPv6 address and default routersettings. However, further settings are not available. If suchhosts wish to automatically configure their DNS, NTP or otherspecific settings the stateless variant of the Dynamic HostConfiguration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) could be used. Thiscombination of Stateless Address Autoconfiguration and statelessDHCPv6 could be used quite commonly in IPv6 networks. However,hosts using such a combination currently have no means by which to beinformed of changes in stateless DHCPv6 option settings, e.g. theaddition of a new NTP server address, changes in DNS search paths, orfull site renumbering. This document is presented as a problemstatement from which a solution should be proposed in a subsequentdocument.</t>
