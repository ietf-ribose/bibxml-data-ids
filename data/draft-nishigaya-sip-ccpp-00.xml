      <t>This document proposes a SIP extension for CC/PP (Composite Capability/Preference Profiles) exchange. CC/PPex, proposed by W3C, is only usable for client-pull service like HTTP. It is not suitable for server initiated push services. Since traditional SIP already has a method to convey the limited terminal capabilities for multimedia calls, SIP naturally extends to support CC/PP. This extension allows various types of push services to know the terminal capabilities before delivering the contents to the push clients. This is accomplished by introducing some additional headers in the REGISTER/OPTIONS message that carry the same information as CC/PPex does.</t>
