      <t>IETF meetings are held physically in various geographic regions of the world. One of the criteria for choosing a location is the amount of participation by the people in that region. Additionally, questions arise as to whether holding a physical meeting in a location increases the amount of participation by local attendees. Participation in the IETF process may occur in a number of different ways: email lists, writing drafts, physical or remote attendance at a meeting, chairing Working Groups and so on. This document defines the metrics and terms which may be used to measure participation both before and after an IETF meeting.</t>
