      <t>Security events communicated within Security Event Tokens may support a variety of identifiers to identify the subject and/or other principals related to the event. This specification formalizes the notion of subject identifiers as named sets of well-defined claims describing the subject, a mechanism for representing subject identifiers within a [JSON] object such as a JSON Web Token [JWT] or Security Event Token [SET], and a registry for defining and allocating names for these claim sets.</t>
