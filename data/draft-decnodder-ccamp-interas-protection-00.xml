      <t>This document describes a solution for link protection, node protection, Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) protection and fast recovery of inter-AS packet based LSPs. These problems are highlighted in [ASREQ]. The proposed solution is based on RSVP-TE [RFC3209] as recommended by [ASREQ]. Only the protection of links between 2 ASs, the protection of their SRLGs and of the nodes at the border of an AS are in the scope of this document.</t>
