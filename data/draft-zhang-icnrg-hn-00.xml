    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a hybrid naming scheme for unifying all kinds of information. As many proposals of novel network architectures emerge, such as DONA, ICN, NDN, the location-based routing starts to transfer to the content-based ones. Currently, it is incompatible that many different information naming schemes are adopted in different network proposals, respectively, i.e. flat names in DONA, hierarchical names in NDN. The naming format defined is to identify different routing information uniformly. The format adopts a hybrid structure including hierarchical component, flat component and attribute component, providing great compatibility and advantages.</t>
