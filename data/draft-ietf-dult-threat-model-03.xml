    <abstract>
      <t>Lightweight Location-tracking Tags are in wide use to allow users to locate items. These Tags function as a component of a Crowdsourced Network in which Devices belonging to other network users (e.g., phones) report which Tags they see and their location, thus allowing the Owner(s) of the Tag to determine where their Tag was most recently seen. While there are many legitimate uses of these Tags, they are also susceptible to misuse for the purpose of stalking and abuse. A protocol that allows others to detect Unwanted Tracking must incorporate an understanding of the Unwanted Tracking landscape today. This document provides a threat analysis for this purpose, including a taxonomy of Unwanted Tracking and potential attacks against Detection of Unwanted Location Tracking (DULT) protocols. The document defines what is in and out of scope for the Unwanted Tracking protocols, and provides design requirements, constraints, and considerations for implementation of protocols to detect Unwanted Tracking.</t>
