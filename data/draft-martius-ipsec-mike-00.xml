      <t>This document describes a protocol which allows to authenticate systems and establish Security Associations in networks with different domains of security. The protocol is not only end-to-end, but it involves all participating systems in a single exchange. Further it allows security gateways to derive sub-policies for crossing (encrypted) IPSec-traffic from 'conventional' packet filtering rules in a trusted manner.</t>
