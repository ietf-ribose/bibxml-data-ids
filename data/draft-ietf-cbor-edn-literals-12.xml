      <t>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) (STD 94, RFC 8949) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. In addition to the binary interchange format, CBOR from the outset (RFC 7049) defined a text-based "diagnostic notation" in order to be able to converse about CBOR data items without having to resort to binary data. RFC 8610 extended this into what is known as Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN). This document consolidates the definition of EDN, sets forth a further step of its evolution, and is intended to serve as a single reference target in specifications that use EDN. It specifies an extension point for adding application-oriented extensions to the diagnostic notation. It then defines two such extensions that enhance EDN with text representations of epoch-based date/times and of IP addresses and prefixes (RFC 9164). A few further additions close some gaps in usability. The document modifies one extension originally specified in Appendix G.4 of RFC 8610 to enable further increasing usability. To facilitate tool interoperation, this document specifies a formal ABNF grammar, and it adds media types. // The present revision -12 reflects the branch "roll-up" in the // repository, an attempt to contain the entire specification of EDN // in this document, instead of describing updates to the existing // documents RFC 8949 and RFC 8610. While the WG hasn't taken a // decision to follow this updated editorial approach, the feedback // has been sufficiently positive that the author believes it is not // misleading to make this revision available as the current WG // Internet-Draft as well. That said, this is still a snapshot. The // editorial work on the branch "roll-up" is not complete. Content // will continue to move between sections. The exact reflection of // this document being a replacement for both Section 8 of RFC 8949 // and Appendix G of RFC 8610 needs to be recorded in the metadata // and in abstract and introduction.</t>
