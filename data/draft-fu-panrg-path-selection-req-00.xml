      <t>Emerging new services have new business characteristics, different from traditional C/S business model, whose most traffic is downstream traffic, more and more new business with gradually increasing upstream traffic have appeared, such as short videos, live sales etc,. Due to the new traffic characteristics of these services, more requirements have been put forward for the choice of network paths. In addition, emerging services also put forward new requirements for computing. Only selecting the network path or the service node cannot meet the stringent requirements. The perception of network paths and path selection also need to consider the characteristics of the service, and further need to coordinate the state of the network side and the service node side. The application of path-aware networking can assist the terminal to better perceive the network status, and also combine the status of the service node to achieve on-demand, more fine-grained path selection.</t>
