      <t>[RFC7540] defines HTTP/2, including a method for communicating priorities. Some implementations have begun using closed streams as placeholders when constructing their priority tree, but this has unbounded state commitments and interacts poorly with HTTP/QUIC ([I-D.ietf-quic-http]). This document proposes an extension to the HTTP/2 priority scheme for both protocols.</t>
