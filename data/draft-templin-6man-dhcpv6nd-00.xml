    <abstract>
      <t>On some IPv6 links, hosts/clients may have advanced knowledge that all routers on the link would be willing to provide DHCPv6 address/ prefix delegation services without the need for an initial RS/RA message exchange followed by one or more separate DHCPv6 exchanges. This document specifies a new IPv6 Neighbor Discovery option termed the "DHCPv6 Option" that supports the managed delegation of addresses/prefixes in a single message exchange.</t>
