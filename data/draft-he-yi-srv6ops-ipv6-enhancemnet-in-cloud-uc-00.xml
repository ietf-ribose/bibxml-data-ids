      <t>This document outlines the use cases for implementing IPv6 enhancement techniques in cloud, motivated by the increasing demand for collabration between cloud and network. The capabilities of IPv6 and IPv6 enhancement in most cloud service are not ready, such as Service Function Chain based on SRv6, Performance measurement based on IPv6.If we want to realize these capabilities of IPv6 enhancement end-to-end, we can use a Virtual Incloud Router as anagent which support IPv6 and IPv6 enhancement.</t>
