    <abstract>
      <t>The IP Security protocol is now well established and is being deployed in the global Internet. The security characteristics of IPSec can be used in Mobile IP networks to enable Mobile IP deployment on a wide area basis and in large networks. Mobile IP should leverage off of the developments of IP Security and Internet Key Exchange (IKE) rather than developing it's own security mechanisms. This draft proposes some concepts on how IP Security can be used to provide an alternative security framework for Mobile IP communications. It is intended to be an implementation guideline.</t>
