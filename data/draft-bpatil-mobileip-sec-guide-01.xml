      <t>The IP Security protocol is now well established and is beingdeployed in the global Internet. The security characteristics ofIPSec can be used in Mobile IP networks to enable Mobile IPdeployment on a wide area basis and in large networks. Mobile IPshould leverage off of the developments of IP Security and InternetKey Exchange (IKE) rather than developing it's own securitymechanisms.This draft proposes some concepts on how IP Security can be used toprovide an alternative security framework for Mobile IPcommunications. It is intended to be an implementation guideline.</t>
