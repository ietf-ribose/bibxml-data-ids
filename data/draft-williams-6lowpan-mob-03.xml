      <t>There has been discussion recently within the 6LoWPAN communityregarding mobile usage scenarios. Mobility considerations isrequired for the deployment of SmartGrids. The mobility analysis forSmartGrid and 6lowpan deployment is required to ensure properperformance for the mobile usage cases. Also, mobility in 6LoWPANsensor networks may present unique challenges to the 6LoWPANarchitecture. Hence it is best to have mobility as a considerationupfront rather than an after thought in the development of 6LoWPANmilestones. This document provides a mobility perspective to the6LoWPAN sensor network architecture.</t>
