      <t>The NEMO Basic Support protocol has well-known issues when multiple mobile routers are connected to each other in a nested fashion. These issues have been already analyzed in the NEMO Working Group. However, solutions are not yet considered and discussed in the IETF. MANEMO (MANET for NEMO) is an approach to resolve these issues. Although most of issues are relevant to what the MANET working group is chartered to deliver, a different approach may be required. This document identifies the problems which MANEMO will solve and provides the MANEMO requirements.</t>
