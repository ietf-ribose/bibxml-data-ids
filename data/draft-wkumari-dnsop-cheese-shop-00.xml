      <t>This document cuts down on junk queries to the DNS root and improves performance by answering queries locally from compliant resolvers. It does this by actually believing the NSEC responses. [ Ed note: Text inside square brackets ([]) is additional background information, answers to frequently asked questions, general musings, etc. They will be removed before publication.] [ This document is being collaborated on in Github at: https://github.com/wkumari/draft-wkumari-dnsop-cheese-shop.
