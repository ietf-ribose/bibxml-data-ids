      <t>This memo specifies a simple mechanism for Lightweight AFTR (lwAFTR) to notify Lightweight B4 (lwB4) to initiate the recreation of the binding when lwAFTR does not have the subscriber mapping in the mapping table. This often happens at failover the backup lwAFTR does not have the subscriber mapping information to process the packets between lwB4 and external IPv4 host.</t>
