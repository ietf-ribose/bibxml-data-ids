      <t>This document describes the expected business telephony requirements for delivering called party name towards SIP entities. A couple of mechanisms exist to deliver calling name and number to the called party. None exist for exposing the called party name or preferred identity to the calling party. This draft proposes a mechanism to provide this capability.</t>
