    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a structural organization of Internet top level domain names based on the International Schedule of Classes of Goods and Services. This structure intends to provide a framework for classification such that web content providers can differentiate their goods and services and minimize the probability of name confusion and collision. Under each class, as specified by the International Schedule of Classes of Goods and Services, single or multiple top level domain names should be specified each appropriately partitioning the class of goods or service into an appropriate sub-categorization. A method will further be described to incorporate additions/modifications as becomes necessary by as of yet unforseen future developments. This document does not address the delegation or the administration of top level domain names which the author feels should be considered separately. However, the author does acknowledge that some form of centralized authority should be in place to properly control the structure to be described.</t>
