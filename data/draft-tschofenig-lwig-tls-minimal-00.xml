    <abstract>
      <t>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a widely used security protocol that offers communication security services at the transport layer. The initial design of TLS was focused on the protection of applications running on top of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and was a good match for securing the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Subsequent standardization efforts lead to the publication of Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), which added the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP). The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP), as a more recent connection-oriented transport protocol, also benefits from TLS support. TLS can be customized in a variety of ways and every feature has a certain cost. To offer input for implementers and system architects this document illustrates the implications of selected TLS features for the code size.</t>
