      <t>Handoff in IP mobility protocols involves moving a mobile node'sLayer 3 routing reachability point from one access router toanother, before or after the mobile node has established a Layer 2connection with the radio access point that is covered by the newaccess router. In addition, other context information about themobile node's IP service may be transferred from the old accessrouter to the new one, in order to minimize the service disruptionduring the handoff process. While the exact details of how this isaccomplished vary depending on the IP mobility and seamless handoffprotocols, one common thread required for IP-level handoffs isdiscovering the candidate access routers for the mobile node'shandoff. Discovering the candidate access router involvesidentifying its IP address as well as its capabilities that themobile node might be interested in. At the time of IP-level handoff,if a collection of candidates is identified, an algorithm is run todetermine the target access router for the mobile node's handoff.This document describes the problem of candidate access routerdiscovery. The document does not discuss the algorithm by which theactual target access router is selected, nor how the handoff to thetarget is achieved.</t>
