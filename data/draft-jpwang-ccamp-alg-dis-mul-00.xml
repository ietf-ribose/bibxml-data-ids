      <t>The routing problem of multi-domain optical network includes intra-domain routing and inter-domain routing.Although the intra-domain routing algorithm has been well studied, the inter-domain routing computation in distributed multi-domain optical network still presents many problems and needs further research. Compared to single domain, the routing computation in multi-domain network needs topology abstraction.In this paper, we first have full-mesh topology abstraction improved, and then present a novel algorithm to calculate the inter-domain routing. By computing the shortest path based on the available wavelengths, the proposed algorithm improves the performance of routing provision. Simulation results show that the new algorithm achieves the satisfactory blocking performance.</t>
