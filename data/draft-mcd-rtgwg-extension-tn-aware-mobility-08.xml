    <abstract>
      <t>The existing Transport Network Aware Mobility for 5G (TN-AWARE- MOBILITY) specifies a framework for mapping the 5G mobile systems' Slice and Service Types (SSTs) to corresponding underlying network paths to ensure the desired QoS for the services.The focus of (TN- AWARE-MOBILITY) is limited to the 3GPP domain and doesn't cover the network for user plane traffic between the UPFs and the services hosted in data centers. This document describes the mechanisms to achieve the same QoS for the mobility traffic from the 3GPP domain to the service destinations over the IP Data Networks. Extending the QoS guarantee for the SSTs to the data centers where the services are hosted becomes necessary to maintain the end-to-end QoS for data plane traffic between UEs and their corresponding service destinations.</t>
