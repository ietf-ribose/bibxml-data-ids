      <t>The raise in complexity and size of modern networks makes it significantly more challenging to deploy new services and to keep networks up to date while maintaining stability and availability for critical business services. This is a major challenge that network operators (service providers, SME, etc) face today. The operators aim at streamlining operations and the deployment of new services by relying increasingly on programmatic control of network elements and the use of various virtualization technologies. In this context, providing network operators with a set of standard generic YANG-based data models that enable management and automation of services on their network is essential. This document describes the set of related problems addressed by the SUPA (Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions ) working group.</t>
