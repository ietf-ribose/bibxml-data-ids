    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes a new technology named iCAN (instant Congestion Assessment Network), which represents a set of mechanisms running directly on network nodes. These mechanisms allow the nodes adjusting the flows' paths based on real-time measurement of the candidate paths. The measurement is to reflect the congestion situation of each path, so that the nodes could decide which flows need to be switched from a path to another. This is something that current TE technologies can hardly achieve. In current TE, the paths are usually planned in a certralized controller, which is far from the data plane, thus neither be able to assess the real-time congestion situation of each path, nor able to assure the data plane always go as expected (especially in SRv6 scenarios). In a result, traditional TE is not able to adjust the flow paths in real-time to fit for the change of traffic instantly. iCAN can work with traditional TE perfectly: the controller plans multi-path transmission in relatively long period (e.g. minutes), and iCAN does the flow path optimization in a much shorter interval (e.g. milliseconds).</t>
