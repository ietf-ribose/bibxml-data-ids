      <t>This draft describes a simple network-based protocol to facilitate Path Selection and to improve traffic engineering capabilities in multihomed corporate networks. With the protocol, any network device that requires to select a path among a list of different paths asks a Traffic Engineering service called IDIPS (ISP-Driven Informed Path Selection) to obtain an ordered list of the possible paths. The ordering is constructed according to the policies and performances requirements of both the host and network provider.</t>
