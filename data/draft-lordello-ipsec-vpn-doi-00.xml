      <t>The IPSec DOI for ISAKMP defines identities for phase 2 exchangesthat are suitable for a flat, unique address space. On the otherhand, different VPN's cannot guarantee a non-overlapping addressspace among them. Therefore when security gateways on an ISP networknegotiate IPSec SA's in the context of multiple VPN's, identifyingtraffic flows for this multiplicity of VPN's become an issue. Ofcourse, an alternative would be to have multiple contexts ofsecurity gateways, one for each VPN. Unfortunately that would imposesevere administrative challenges to an ISP, some of which aredescribed later. Another alternative and a more appealing one wouldbe to have a single security gateway with a single tunnel endpointaddress, a single X.509 certificate, etc., that exists in a commoncontext and is able to negotiate IPSec tunnels for any VPN with apresence in the security gateway. For the later to be possiblehowever, it is required for this common security gateway to be ableto negotiate phase 2 SA's on behalf of each one of these VPN's withoverlapping address spaces. A second motivation for the laterapproach would be to simply negotiate IPSec tunnels for each VPN asa whole without implying any specific traffic flow. Thisspecification describes an extended DOI for ISAKMP which, whileinheriting the existing IPSec DOI in its entirety, defines extratypes of phase 2 identities which include a VPN-ID field as an extrapiece of tunnel identity, i.e., a qualifier for the IP addressesselectors. The VPN-ID is defined in RFC 2685.</t>
