      <t>This contribution describes a carriers optical services frameworkand associated requirements for the User-Network Interface (UNI). Itis intended to provide carrier specific service requirements for theautomatic switched optical networks to guide the on-going efforts todevelop the standard UNI and other interfaces to the optical layer(OL) control plane. Due to time constraints, no attempt has beenmade to provide detailed comprehensive requirements; instead wefocused on topics of particular interest or concern to the carriercommunity. This is a work-in-progress document and is expected toevolve in near term as new requirements are identified and furtherstudied.</t>
