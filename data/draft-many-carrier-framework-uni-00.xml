      <t>This contribution describes a carriers optical services framework and associated requirements for the User-Network Interface (UNI). It is intended to provide carrier specific service requirements for the automatic switched optical networks to guide the on-going efforts to develop the standard UNI and other interfaces to the optical layer (OL) control plane. Due to time constraints, no attempt has been made to provide detailed comprehensive requirements; instead we focused on topics of particular interest or concern to the carrier community. This is a work-in-progress document and is expected to evolve in near term as new requirements are identified and further studied.</t>
