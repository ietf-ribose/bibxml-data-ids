    <abstract>
      <t>As the development of cloud computing, increasing services have been migrated from enterprise sites to clouds, so the connections between sites and clouds are critical for enterprises. SRv6 provides a sourcing routing mechanism to connect the enterprise sites and clouds by programming the end-to-end path at the ingress node. In this scenario, the SRv6 packets may traverse multiple network domains and some of them may not be SRv6-capable. In order to support SRv6 end-to-end path programming, this document proposes the mechanism of SRv6 traversing IPv4 network.</t>
