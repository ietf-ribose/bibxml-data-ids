    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents an architecture for IPv6 access networks that decouples the network-layer concepts of Links, Interface, and Subnets from the link-layer concepts of links, ports, and broadcast domains, and limits the reliance on link-layer broadcasts. This architecture is suitable for IPv6 over any network, including non-broadcast networks. A study of the issues with ND-Classic over wireless media is presented, and a framework to solve those issues within the new architecture is proposed.</t>
