      <t>The MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) identifiers document [RFC6370] specifies an initial set of identifiers, including the local assigned Z9-Tunnel_Num, which can be used to form Maintenance Entity Point Identifier (MEP_ID). As to some Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM) functions, such as Connectivity Verification (CV) [RFC6428], source MEP_ID must be inserted in the OAM packets, so that the peer endpoint can compare the received and expected MEP_IDs to judge whether there is a mis-connectivity defect [RFC6371], which means that the two MEP nodes need to pre-store each other's MEP_IDs. This document defines the signaling extensions to communicate the local assigned Z9-Tunnel_Num to the ingress LSR (Label Switching Router) of a co-routed bidirectional LSP.</t>
