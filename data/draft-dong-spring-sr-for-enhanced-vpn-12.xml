      <t>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. A node steers a packet through an ordered list of instructions, called "segments". A segment can represent topological or service based instructions. A segment can further be associated with network resources allocated for executing the instruction. Such a segment is called resource-aware SID. Resource-aware SIDs may be used to build SR paths with a set of reserved network resources. In addition, resource-aware SIDs may be used to build SR based virtual underlay networks, which can provide the customized network topology and resource attributes required by different customers and/or services. Such virtual networks are called SR based Virtual Transport Networks (VTNs). The SR based VTNs can be used as the underlay network to enable services with required topology and resource characteristics. This document describes a suggested use of resource-aware SIDs to build SR based VTNs.</t>
