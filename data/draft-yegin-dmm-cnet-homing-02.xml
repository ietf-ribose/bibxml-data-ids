      <t>Mobile IP protocols provide IP session continuity to Mobile Nodes at the expense of creating triangular routes via a centralized Home Agent. Increased latency and network resource use, introduction of a single point of failure and a network choke point are among the undesirable side effects of the current protocols. This document describes an alternative approach where the Mobile Node makes use of dynamically-assigned Home Agent that is located close to the Corresponding Node.</t>
