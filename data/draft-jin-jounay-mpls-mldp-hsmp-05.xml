      <t>This draft introduces a hub &amp; spoke multipoint LSP (short for HSMP LSP), which allows traffic both from root to leaf through P2MP LSP and also leaf to root along the co-routed reverse path. That means traffic entering the HSMP LSP from application/customer at the root node travels downstream, exactly as if it was traveling downstream along a P2MP LSP to each leaf node, and traffic entering the HSMP LSP at any leaf node travels upstream along the tree to the root. A packet traveling upstream should be thought of as being unicast to the root, except that it follows the path of the tree rather than ordinary unicast path.</t>
