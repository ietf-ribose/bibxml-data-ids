    <abstract>
      <t>This document delineates the requirements for standards specifications in Energy Efficiency Management, extending the foundational work of RFC6988 and incorporating recent insights from operator requirements and the GREEN BoF discussions. Eleven years after the publication of RFC6988, this document reassesses and updates the requirements to align with contemporary needs. The primary objectives of this draft, which are listed in the goals and scope with the creation of the GREEN WG charter, is focusing on two main targets: (1) collecting and updating requirements for the management of energy-efficient networks, and (2) defining use cases for managing energy-efficient networks. This draft merges the drafts [rfc6988bis-green] and [green-bof-reqs].
