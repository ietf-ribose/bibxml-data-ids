      <t>This document imposes a new requirement on Label Edge Routers (LER)specifying that when determining whether to MPLS encapsulate an IPpacket, the determination is made independent of any IP options thatmay be carried in the IP packet header. Lack of a formal standardmay result in a different forwarding behavior for different IPpackets associated with the same prefix-based Forwarding EquivalenceClass (FEC). While an IP packet with either a specific option typeor no header option may follow the MPLS label switched path (LSP)associated with a prefix-based FEC, an IP packet with a differentoption type but associated with the same prefix-based FEC may bypassMPLS encapsulation and instead be IP routed downstream. IP optionpackets that fail to be MPLS encapsulated simply due to their headeroptions present a security risk against the MPLS infrastructure.</t>
