      <t>Network Service Providers (NSPs) are currently considering to deploy Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) within their networks. As a consequence of this development, there is a need for interconnecting these local CDNs. The necessary interfaces for inter-connecting CDNs are currently being defined in the Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI) WG. This document focuses on the CDNI Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI). Specifically, this document specifies a new Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) service to facilitate Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement in a CDNI context.</t>
