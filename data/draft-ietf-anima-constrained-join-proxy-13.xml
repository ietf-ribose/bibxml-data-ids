    <abstract>
      <t>This document extends the work of Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructures (BRSKI) by replacing the (stateful) TLS Circuit proxy between Pledge and Registrar with a stateless or stateful Circuit proxy using CoAP which is called the constrained Join Proxy. The constrained Join Proxy is a mesh neighbor of the Pledge and can relay a DTLS session originating from a Pledge with only link-local addresses to a Registrar which is not a mesh neighbor of the Pledge. Like the BRSKI Circuit proxy, this constrained Join Proxy eliminates the need of Pledges to have routeable IP addresses before enrolment by utilizing link-local addresses. Use of the constrained Join Proxy also eliminates the need of the Pledge to authenticate to the network or perform network-wide Registrar discover before enrolment.</t>
