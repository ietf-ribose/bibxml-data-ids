    <abstract>
      <t>The "Historical" category has been used to identify some documents in the RFC Series for many years, but has never been precisely defined except in various oral traditions. More important, with one exception that is now obsolete, the conditions under which documents should be reclassified as Historic and the procedures for doing so have never been defined, leading to a number of ad hoc and inconsistent actions. This document clarifies both the category and procedures for putting documents into it.</t>
