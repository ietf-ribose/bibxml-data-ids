    <abstract>
      <t>The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol [RFC7285] has defined several resources and services to provide clients with basic network information. However, the base ALTO protocol and latest extensions only provide end-to-end metrics, which are insufficient to satisfy the demands of solving more complex network optimization problems. This document introduces an extension to the base ALTO protocol, namely the path-vector extension, which allows ALTO clients to query information such as capacity regions for a given set of flows. A non-normative example called multi-flow scheduling is presented to illustrate the limitations of existing ALTO (endpoint) cost maps. After that, details of the extension are defined.</t>
