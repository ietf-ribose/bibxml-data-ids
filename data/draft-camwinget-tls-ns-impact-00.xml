    <abstract>
      <t>Network-based security solutions are used by enterprises, the public sector, internet-service providers, and cloud-service providers to both complement and enhance host-based security solutions.

This document describes this interaction for current operational security practices and notes the impact of TLS 1.3 on them.</t>
