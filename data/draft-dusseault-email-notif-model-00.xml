      <t>Email servers have event information which is of interest to a wide variety of clients, devices and users, and this motivates an effort to tie Email servers into the existing Internet notifications architecture as described by the Common Profile for Presence (CPP). This document describes where Email servers fit into CPP and what pieces are missing. This is not purely a requirements document because it describes a specific architecture, but it makes some requirements on future documents that fill in pieces of the architecture.</t>
