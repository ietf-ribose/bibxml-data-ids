      <t>In the push toward Level 4 Autonomous Networks, CSPs must to adopt new processes and organizational changes, along with function-centric building blocks for higher autonomy. As intelligent agents evolve, network autonomy increasingly relies on deploying these agents, enabling self-management, self-healing, and adaptation with minimal human intervention. These agents facilitate the transition toward fully autonomous network operations across multiple layers, including services and resources. However, achieving Level 4 autonomy, where networks independently handle tasks across various domains, presents significant challenges, notably secure, efficient, and accurate multi-agent interactions. This document introduces a protocol- agnostic data model that enables multiple intelligent agents to communicate effectively using the model, ensuring end-to-end task execution and closed-loop operations in autonomous networks.</t>
