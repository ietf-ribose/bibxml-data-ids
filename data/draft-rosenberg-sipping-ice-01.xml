      <t>This document describes a methodology for Network Address Translator(NAT) traversal for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Thismethodology is called Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE).ICE is not a new protocol, but rather makes use of existingprotocols, such as Simple Traversal of UDP Through NAT (STUN),Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN) and even Real Specific IP (RSIP).ICE works through the mutual cooperation of both endpoints in a SIPdialog. By having the endpoints work together in NAT traversal, anumber of important properties are obtained. ICE always works,independent of the types or number of NATs. It always represents thecheapest solution for a carrier. It always results in the minimumvoice latency. It can be done with no increase in call setup delays.It is far less brittle than STUN. ICE also facilitates the transitionof the Internet from IPv4 to IPv6, supporting calls betweendual-stack and v6 clients behind a 4to6 NAT. Preconditions can beused in conjunction with ICE, to guarantee that the phone never ringsunless the users will both hear and see each other when they pick up.</t>
