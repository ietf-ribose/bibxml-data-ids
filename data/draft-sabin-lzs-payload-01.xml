      <t>This memo proposes a 'payload compression transform' based on the LZS compression algorithm. The transform can be used to compress the payload field of an IP datagram that uses the Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) format. The compression transform proposed here is stateless, meaning that a datagram can be decompressed independently of any other datagram. Compression is performed prior to the encryption operation of ESP, which has the side benefit of reducing the amount of data that must be encrypted. This memo anticipates a forthcoming ESP document that will supercede [Atkins96]. The forthcoming document will allow for ESP payloads to be compressed via transforms such as the one described in this memo.</t>
