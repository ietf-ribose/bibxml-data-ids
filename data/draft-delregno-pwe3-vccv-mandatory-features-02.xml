      <t>Pseudowire Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) [RFC5085]defines several Control Channel (CC) Types for MPLS PW's , none ofwhich are preferred or mandatory. As a result, independentimplementations of different subsets of the three options haveresulted in interoperability challenges. In RFC5085 the CV type ofLSP Ping is made the default for MPLS PW's and ICMP Ping is madeoptional. This however, is a recommendation and not a requirementfor implementations which can also lead to interoperabilitychallenges.To enable interoperability between implementations, this documentdefines a subset of control channels that is considered mandatory forVCCV implementation. This will ensure that VCCV remains the valuabletool it was designed to be in multi-vendor, multi-implementation andmulti-carrier networks. This document also states requirements forthe CV type too.This draft is specific to MPLS PW's and not L2TPv3 PW. For theL2TPv3 PW only one CC and CV type are specified and the issues raisedin this draft do not arise.</t>
