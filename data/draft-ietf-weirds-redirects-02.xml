    <abstract>
      <t>The traditional WHOIS protocol has several important shortcomings, and over the past few years several approaches to a better Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) have been discussed and proposed. It is worth noting that the term WHOIS is sometimes used interchangeably to mean either (a) the registration data itself or (b) the protocol used to access registration data Among these shortcomings, different registries operate different WHOIS services. For users this means that several WHOIS queries to different registries may be necessary in order to obtain data for a given resource. This document describes a redirection service for RDAP queries. This service allows clients to query a single RDAP service and expect either an authoritative answer or a redirection hint pointing to another, possibly authoritative, RDAP server. The solution implemented proposed here applies to Regional Internet Registries(RIRs) and Domain Name Registries(DNRs).</t>
