      <t>An important challenge in wireless sensor network (WSN) is that howto route data packets from sources to base station energy efficiently.Inspiring data fusion feature and multi-hop routing, in this document,we introduce a clustering approach called PLIR (Prolonging NetworkLifetime via Intra-Cluster Routing) for saving energy anddistributing data dissipation evenly by improving BS cluster formationalgorithm of LEACH-Centralized and providing 3-hop routing algorithmwithin clusters. Hence, it prolongs the lifetime of WSN. PLIR consumesless energy and reduces communication overhead, and extends thenetwork lifetime compared with other approaches.</t>
