    <abstract>
      <t>The Nagle algorithm is one of the primary mechanisms which protects the internet from poorly designed and/or implemented applications. However, for a certain class of applications (notably, request-response protocols) the Nagle algorithm interacts poorly with delayed acknowledgements to give these applications poorer performance. This draft is NOT suggesting that these applications should disable the Nagle algorithm. This draft suggests a fairly small and simple modification to the Nagle algorithm to preserve Nagle as a means of protecting the internet while at the same time giving better performance to a wider class of applications.</t>
