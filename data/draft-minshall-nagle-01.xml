      <t>The Nagle algorithm is one of the primary mechanisms which protectsthe internet from poorly designed and/or implemented applications.However, for a certain class of applications (notably,request-response protocols) the Nagle algorithm interacts poorlywith delayed acknowledgements to give these applications poorerperformance.This draft is NOT suggesting that these applications should disablethe Nagle algorithm. This draft suggests a fairly small and simple modification to the Nagle algorithm to preserve Nagle as a means of protecting the internet while at the same time giving better performance to a wider class of applications.</t>
