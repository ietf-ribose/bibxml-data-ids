      <t>This documents describe a technique called A-PAWS which can provide protection against old duplicates segments like PAWS. While PAWS requires TCP to set timestamp options in all segments in a TCP connection, A-PAWS supports the same feature without using timestamps. A-PAWS is designed to be used complementary with PAWS. TCP needs to use PAWS when it is necessary and activates A-PAWS only when it is safe to use. Without impairing the reliability and the robustness of TCP, A-PAWS can provide more option space to other TCP extensions.</t>
