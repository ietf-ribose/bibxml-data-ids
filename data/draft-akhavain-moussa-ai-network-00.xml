    <abstract>
      <t>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping industries and daily life, driven by advances in large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, and DeepSeek. These models have demonstrated the transformative potential of AI across diverse applications, from productivity tools to complex decision-making systems. However, the effectiveness and reliability of AI hinge on two foundational processes: training and inference. Each presents unique challenges related to data management, computation, connectivity, privacy, trust, security, and governance. This document introduces the Data Aware-Inference and Training Network (DA-ITN)—a unified, intelligent, multi-plane network architecture designed to address the full spectrum of AI system requirements. DA- ITN provides a scalable and adaptive infrastructure that connects AI clients, data providers, service facilitators, and computational resources to support end-to-end AI lifecycle operations. The architecture features dedicated control, data, and operations &amp; management (OAM) planes to orchestrate training and inference while ensuring reliability, transparency, and accountability. By outlining the key requirements of AI systems and demonstrating how DA-ITN fulfills them, this document presents a vision for the future of AI- native networking—an "AI internet"—optimized for continuous learning, scalable deployment, and seamless agent-to-agent collaboration.</t>
