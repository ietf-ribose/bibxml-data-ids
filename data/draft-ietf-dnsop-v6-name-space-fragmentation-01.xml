      <t>This memo documents some problems forseen in transitioning from a IPv4-only DNS hierarchy via a long period of mixture to an IPv6-mostly situation sometime in the future. The mixture period is expected to be very long, and hence design choices should very much take this into account, rather than just regard the transition as a relatively short period of pain.</t>
