      <t>This document proposes the '3DES-CBC-LZS-HMAC-Replay' security transform for the IP Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). The proposed transform combines triple-DES encryption, LZS compression, HMAC authentication, and replay prevention into a single packet format. The transform is compatible with implementations that do not support compression and with implementations that support only single-DES encryption. Compression is performed prior to encryption, which has the side benefit of reducing the amount of data that must be encrypted. This document is based on the IPsec Working Group's proposed 'Combined DES-CBC, HMAC, and Replay Prevention Security Transform,' cited later in this document.</t>
