    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents a framework for in-network caching in LTE mobile networks. The purpose of the framework is to provide an overall picture of the problem space of in-network caching and to describe the relationships among the various components of mobile networks and the newly added entities, such as content nodes and content controller. The framework requires the specification of interfaces and mechanisms to address issues such as content placement, request routing and content catalog maintenance. The intent of this document is to outline what each interface needs to accomplish and to describe how these interfaces and mechanisms fit together, while leaving their detailed specification to other documents.</t>
