      <t>A growing number of SIP based services depend on the idea that clients may publish service-related information to network elements. This information may then affect further processing of the service. Examples of such services include presence and CPL. Multiple protocols may exists for the actual publication of such data. But regardless of the protocol, a client must know where to send it. This document describes requirements for a mechanism to inform clients where and how to publish service related information.</t>
