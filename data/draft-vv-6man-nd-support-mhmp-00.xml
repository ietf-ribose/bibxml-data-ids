    <abstract>
      <t>Multi-home Multi-prefix IPv6 environment is the norm for businesses that need to have uplink resiliency. For any considered destination, the MHMP challenge may be split into 3 sub-challenges (important to solve in the below order): 1) the host should choose the proper source address for the packet, 2) the host should choose the best default router as the next-hop, 3) site topology may be complicated and may need the source routing through the site. This draft is concerned with the solution for the first two problems that need improvement for the ND (RFC 4861) SLAAC (RFC 4862) and Default Address Selection (RFC 6724). The last problem is considered as properly discussed by Multihoming in Enterprise (RFC 8678).</t>
