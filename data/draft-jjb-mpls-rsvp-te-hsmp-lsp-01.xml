    <abstract>
      <t>In Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) environment, the RSVP-TE based Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) LSP allows traffic to transmit from root to leaf node, but there is no co-routed reverse path for traffic from leaf to root node. This draft introduces a Hub and Spoke Multipoint (HSMP) LSP, which allows traffic from both the root to the leaves through a P2MP LSP and also the leaves to the root along a co-routed reverse path.</t>
