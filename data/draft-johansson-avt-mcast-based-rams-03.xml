      <t>This document proposes Extended RAMS (ERAMS), which is a complementto the unicast based Rapid Acquisition for Multicast based Streaming(RAMS) discussed in [ID-RAMS]. The outline of this addedfunctionality to RAMS is to gather up Rapid Acquisition requests formany users and transmit them in dedicated multicast streams. Withthis technique the peak load on the retransmission server and on theoutgoing link from the retransmission server can be reduced. For aproblem description of the channel change problem in multicast basedIPTV the reader is encouraged to read [ID-RAMS].</t>
