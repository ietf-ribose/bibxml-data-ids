      <t>Large scale Distributed Data Centers (DDCs) can provide various services and usually consist of numbers of internal and external links where various VPNs are built upon. The Service provisioning and network connectivity configurations could be complex and dynamic, and manual configuration is onerous and error-prone. This draft analyzes the use cases in DDCs, in which some VPN scenarios are covered, and the applicability of Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) data models which can be used for better and automated resource usage and easy service/network deployment/ configuration.</t>
