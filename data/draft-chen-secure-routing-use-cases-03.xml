    <abstract>
      <t>Current routing mechanism is based on the shortest path, which only take the link status and the path accessibility into consideration, without the security and trustworthiness of links and forwarding nodes. As security has become an important factor to the user. This paper proposes to add security factor in the routing process. With the frequent occurrence of security incidents, services security is an essential demand for the users. As there are many security devices in the ISP's network, this draft proposes secure routing mechanism. The purpose of secure routing is to converge security and routing to ensure the secure data transmission. The scope is transmission process security, while end-to-end security and application layer security are out of scope.</t>
