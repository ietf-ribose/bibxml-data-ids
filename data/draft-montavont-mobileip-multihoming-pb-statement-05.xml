      <t>The use of multiple interfaces is foreseen to provide ubiquitous, permanent and fault-tolerant access to the Internet, particularly on mobile nodes which are more prone to failure or sudden lack of connectivity. However, Mobile IPv6 currently lacks support for such multihomed nodes. Individual solutions have been proposed to extend Mobile IPv6 but all issues have not been addressed in a single document. The purpose of the present document is thus to fill up this gap and to raise the discussion in order to make sure that forthcoming solutions will address all the issues. In this document, we propose a taxonomy to classify the situations where a mobile node could be multihomed. This taxonomy is then used to highlight the issues preventing mobile nodes operating Mobile IPv6 to be multihomed.</t>
