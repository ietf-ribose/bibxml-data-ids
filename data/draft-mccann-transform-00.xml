      <t>The deployment of Mobile IP in a wide area network presents severalchallenges, not the least of which is how to provide subscriberswith secure access to remote private networks. This draft outlinesmechanisms whereby the home and visited network may negotiate theuse of IP transforms, such as IP Security ESP and AH protocols, onthe Mobile IP redirection tunnels. These mechanisms allow for thesecure distribution of both keys and policies through a DIAMETER AAAinfrastructure, obviating the need for other forms of keydistribution or policy negotiation. The mechanisms are extensibleto other kinds of IP transforms, such as IP Compression.</t>
