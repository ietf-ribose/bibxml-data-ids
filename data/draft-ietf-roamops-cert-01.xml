      <t>To date, roaming implementations have been based on the concept of proxychaining, where packets are routed between the NAS and home serverthrough a series of proxies. While commonly used, proxy chainingintroduces difficult security problems that have prevented itsimplementation on a wide scale.This document describes a new approach to roaming based on certificatesthat eliminates the need for proxy chaining. As described, this approachprovides improved security as well as scalability.</t>
