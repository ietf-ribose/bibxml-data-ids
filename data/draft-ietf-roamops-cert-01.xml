      <t>To date, roaming implementations have been based on the concept of proxy chaining, where packets are routed between the NAS and home server through a series of proxies. While commonly used, proxy chaining introduces difficult security problems that have prevented its implementation on a wide scale. This document describes a new approach to roaming based on certificates that eliminates the need for proxy chaining. As described, this approach provides improved security as well as scalability.</t>
