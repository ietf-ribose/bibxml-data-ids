      <t>This document provides an independent reference for the XML processing profile developed by the WebDAV WG in [RFC2518]. It does this by copying Section 14 and Appendix 4 as well as examples from Appendix 3 of [RFC2518] and editing out any WebDAV specific parts. This information has been broken out into its own independent reference in order to make it easier for other standards to reference just the WebDAV XML processing profile without having to reference the entire WebDAV standard or require their readers to understand which parts of the profile are WebDAV specific and which parts are not.</t>
