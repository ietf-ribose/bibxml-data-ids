      <t>This specification defines generalized primitives for use in establishing end-to-end confidentiality in multiparty communications. These primitives address three essential elements of group privacy: authentication, group membership, and secure key exchange. A core objective of this specification is to define these primitives as common constructs for private group communications and in a manner that allows for flexibility in how they are integrated and deployed as part of new and existing group communications applications.</t>
