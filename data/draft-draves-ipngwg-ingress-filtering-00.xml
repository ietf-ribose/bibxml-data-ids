      <t>This draft discusses some issues surrounding ingress filtering by IPs, site multihoming, and source address selection. The problem is that in a site which has prefixes from multiple ISPs, the source address selected by a host might be inconsistent with the egress ISP for a particular destination address. If the ISP deploys source- address-based ingress filtering, the host will be unable to communicate with the destination. The draft proposes some possible approaches towards a solution.</t>
