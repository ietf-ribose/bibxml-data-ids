    <abstract>
      <t>This draft specifies requirements for inter-carrier OAM supporting end-to-end OAM functionality and mechanisms development in a multi- operator environment. It reviews the already proposed OAM requirements addressed in IETF [RFC5706, RFC5860], ITU-T [Y.1730],MEF [MEFOAM] and IEEE [IEEE1, IEEE2] which were mainly proposed on a per transport technology basis, but aims to differentiate and focus on the requirements and additional requirements resulting from inter- operator considerations only.</t>
