    <abstract>
      <t>CATS (Computing Aware Traffic Steering) is designed to enable the routing network to be aware of computing status thus deliver the service flow accordingly. Nevertheless, computing and networking is quite different in terms of resource granularity as well as its status stability. It would gain significant benefits to accommodate the computing status to that of networking by employing a hierarchical computing routing segment scheme. The network- accommodated computing status could be maintained at remote CATS nodes while the rest could reside at local CATS nodes. By enabling the network to schedule and route computing services in a compatible way with the current IP routing network, CATS would bring benefits to the industry by both efficiently pooling the computing resources and rendering services through perspective of converged networking and computing.</t>
