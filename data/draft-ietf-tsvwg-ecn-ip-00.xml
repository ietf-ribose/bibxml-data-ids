    <abstract>
      <t>This document contributes to the effort to add explicit congestion notification (ECN) to IP. In the current effort to standardise ECN for TCP it is unavoidably necessary to standardise certain new aspects of IP.However, the IP aspects will not and cannot only be specific to TCP. We specify interaction with features of IP such as fragmentation, differentiated services, multicast forwarding, and a definition of the service offered to higher layer congestion control protocols. This document only concerns aspects related to the IP layer, but includes any aspects likely to be common to all higher layer protocols. Any specification of ECN support in higher layer protocols is expected to appear in a separate specification for each such protocol.</t>
