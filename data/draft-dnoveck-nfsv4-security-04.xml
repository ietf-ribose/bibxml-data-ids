      <t>This document describes the core security features of the NFSv4 family of protocols, applying to all minor versions. The discussion includes the use of security features provided by RPC on a per- connection basis. This preliminary version of the document, is intended, in large part, to result in working group discussion regarding existing NFSv4 security issues and to provide a framework for addressing these issues and obtaining working group consensus regarding necessary changes. When a successor document is eventually published as an RFC, it will supersede the description of security appearing in existing minor version specification documents such as RFC 7530 and RFC 8881.</t>
