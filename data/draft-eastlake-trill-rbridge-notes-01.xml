      <t>This document provides additional informational material related to RBridges, which are devices that implement the TRILL protocol. It is a supplement to the RBridges base protocol specification and includes discussion of tradeoffs in some features and configurations of RBridges. In addition, it provides a sketch of a proof that, with reasonable assumptions, persistent loops do not occur in a TRILL campus.</t>
