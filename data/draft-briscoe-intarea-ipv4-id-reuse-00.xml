      <t>This specification takes a new approach to extensibility that is bothprincipled and a hack. It builds on recent moves to formalise theincreasingly common practice where fragmentation in IPv4 more closelymatches that of IPv6. The large majority of IPv4 packets are now'atomic', meaning indivisible. In such packets, the 16 bits of theIPv4 Identification (IPv4 ID) field are redundant and could be freedup for the Internet community to put to other uses, at least withinthe constraints imposed by their original use for reassembly. Thisspecification defines the process for redefining the semantics ofthese bits. It uses the previously reserved control flag in the IPv4header to indicate that these 16 bits have new semantics. Great careis taken throughout to ease incremental deployment, even in thepresence of middleboxes that incorrectly discard or normalise packetsthat have the reserved control flag set.</t>
