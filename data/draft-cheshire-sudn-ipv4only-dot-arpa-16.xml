    <abstract>
      <t>The specification for how a client discovers its local network's NAT64 prefix (RFC7050) defines the special name 'ipv4only.arpa' for this purpose, but in its Domain Name Reservation Considerations section that specification indicates that the name actually has no particularly special properties would require special handling, and does not request IANA to record the name in the Special-Use Domain Names registry. Consequently, despite the well articulated special purpose of the name, 'ipv4only.arpa' was not recorded in the Special-Use Domain Names registry as a name with special properties. This document describes the special treatment required, formally declares the special properties of the name, adds similar declarations for the corresponding reverse mapping names, and updates RFC7050.</t>
