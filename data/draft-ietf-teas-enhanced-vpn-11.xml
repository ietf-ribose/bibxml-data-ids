    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the framework for Enhanced Virtual Private Network (VPN+). The purpose of VPN+ is to support the needs of new applications (e.g. low latency, bounded jitter, etc.), by utilizing an approach that is based on the VPN and Traffic Engineering (TE) technologies, and adds characteristics that specific services require beyond those provided by existing VPNs. Typically, VPN+ will be used to underpin network slicing, but could also be of use in its own right providing enhanced connectivity services between customer sites. This document also provides an overview of relevant technologies in different network layers, and identifies some areas for potential new work.</t>
