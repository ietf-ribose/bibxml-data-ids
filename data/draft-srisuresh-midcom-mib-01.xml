      <t>Middlebox communication (midcom) was conceived to moveapplication level gateway (ALG) intelligence out of middleboxes into application specific midcom agents. Midcomagents will be assumed to use midcom to control middleboxresources so as to permit applications to traverse amiddlebox. The scope of the middleboxes is limited to NAT andfirewall devices. This document defines SNMP managed midcomobjects to control middlebox resources and justifies adaptingSNMPv3 as the midcom protocol.</t>
