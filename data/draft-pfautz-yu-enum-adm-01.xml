      <t>This document considers administrative processes for ENUM and offers a general administrative model for an environment where number portability has been implemented. The ENUM administrative process is a critical piece in making ENUM operational. The administrative process involves several entities. A telephony user's identity and his/her assignment of a telephone number must be validated before ENUM service can be granted. Therefore, the entity that assigns telephone numbers (often but not always telephony user's telephony service provider) plays an important and sometimes necessary role in making the ENUM administrative process successful.</t>
