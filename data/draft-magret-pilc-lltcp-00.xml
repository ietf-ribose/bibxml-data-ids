      <t>This document specifies a protocol enhancement allowing TCP connec-tions to switch from an active state to an idle state during a wire-less link's outage. Within such state all timers are cancelled andpackets' transmission is suspended. The protocol defines a mechanismby which the mobile station may detect a link failure and changes TCPconnections' state to idle. This same mechanism allows the mobilehost to detect connectivity regain. All TCP connections are thenresumed.The protocol defines how the supervisor host, which can monitor thewireless link quality, can alert the fixed host of a failure of thewireless link. The fixed host can suspend the outgoing activity withthe unreachable mobile node. When the fixed hosts start receivingpackets from the mobile node, the activity can be resumed.This protocol increases the capacity of both parties involved in acommunication that is carried via a wireless link to handled connec-tivity disruption without impacting the overall performance of theTCP connections.</t>
