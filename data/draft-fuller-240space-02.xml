      <t>This memo reclassifies the address block 240.0.0.0/4 as usable address space. While the community has not concluded whether the block should be considered public or private, given the current consumption rate, it is clear that the block should not be left unused. This document also makes several recommendations on ways that current implementations of the IP protocol stack will need to be modified to make this address space usable.</t>
