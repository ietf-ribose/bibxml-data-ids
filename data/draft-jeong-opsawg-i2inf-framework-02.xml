    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a framework to define Interface to In-Network Functions (I2INF) for user services both on the network-level and application-level. In-Network Functions (INF) include In-Network Computing Functions (INCF), defined in the context of Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). INF also includes In-Network Application Functions (INAF) which appear in the context of Internet-of-Things (IoT) Devices, Software- Defined Vehicles (SDV), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). This document describes an I2INF framework, which includes components and interfaces to configure and monitor the INFs that implement applications and services.</t>
