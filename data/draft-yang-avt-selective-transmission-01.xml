      <t>When network congestion occurs or dynamic transient burst streamtransfers on a bandwidth constrained network, it is easy to causebursts of consecutive packet loss. Video streams are very vulnerableto packet loss because of motion compensation predictive coding atthe decoder. In this document, we describe a method of usingselective transmission to decrease the effect of random drop to videostream when necessary. At the same time, this document describes amethod to avoid retransmission request due to selective transmission.</t>
