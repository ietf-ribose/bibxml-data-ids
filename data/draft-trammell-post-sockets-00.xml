      <t>This document describes Post Sockets, an asynchronous abstract programming interface for the atomic transmission of objects in an explicitly multipath environment. Post replaces connections with long-lived associations between endpoints, with the possibility to cache cryptographic state in order to reduce amortized connection latency. We present this abstract interface as an illustration of what is possible with present developments in transport protocols when freed from the strictures of the current sockets API.</t>
