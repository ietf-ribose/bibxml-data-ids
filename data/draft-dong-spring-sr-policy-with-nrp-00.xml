    <abstract>
      <t>Segment Routing (SR) Policy is a set of candidate paths, each consisting of one or more segment lists and the associated information. A Network Resource Partition (NRP) is a subset of the network resources and associated policies in the underlay network, which can be used to support one or a group of Enhanced VPN or RFC 9543 network slice services. In SR networks where there are multiple NRPs, an SR Policy may be associated with a particular NRP. Within an NRP, SR Policy can be used for forwarding traffic which is mapped to the NRP, so that the traffic can be provided with the subset of network resources and policy of the NRP for guaranteed performance. The association between SR Policy and NRP needs to be specified. This document defines extensions to the SR Policy Architecture to allow the association of the SR Policy candidate paths with NRPs.</t>
