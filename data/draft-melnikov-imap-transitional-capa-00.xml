      <t>Software releases can't always wait for some document to become an RFC. As the result some software products are released when they implement a non-final version of an IMAP [IMAP4] extension. This may cause substantial interoperability problems between clients and servers that implement different revisions of the same document, as syntax and semantics of operations may change substantially between revisions of the same IMAP extension draft.</t>
