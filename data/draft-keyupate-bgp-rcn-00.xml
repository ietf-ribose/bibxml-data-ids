      <t>Whenever a prefix is withdrawn using BGP withdrawal mechanism, ittriggers a number of updates in certain scenarios before the prefixis completly withdrawn from the entire BGP network. This phenomenonis popularly known as _path exploration_ or _path hunting_ and occursbecause of path vector property of BGP. It results in a series ofunwanted or redundant transitions that overloads the BGP network.This document describes a mechanism to help limit the amount of suchpath exploration by defining two optional transitive path attributesfor BGP: SPEAKERID_PATH and ROOT_CAUSE.</t>
