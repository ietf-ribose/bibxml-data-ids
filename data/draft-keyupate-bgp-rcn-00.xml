      <t>Whenever a prefix is withdrawn using BGP withdrawal mechanism, it triggers a number of updates in certain scenarios before the prefix is completly withdrawn from the entire BGP network. This phenomenon is popularly known as _path exploration_ or _path hunting_ and occurs because of path vector property of BGP. It results in a series of unwanted or redundant transitions that overloads the BGP network. This document describes a mechanism to help limit the amount of such path exploration by defining two optional transitive path attributes for BGP: SPEAKERID_PATH and ROOT_CAUSE.</t>
