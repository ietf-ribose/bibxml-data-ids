      <t>This specification defines a service that manages a type of disposable Internet mail address known as a proxy address. Proxy addresses conform to the standard addressing scheme [RFC 822] and exist in the same address space, but act as aliases for regular, fixed addresses. Users may own many at a time and allocate and deallocate them at will. The service also defines a distinct command-response interface for use between client and server implementations to conduct management chores.</t>
