    <abstract>
      <t>The goal is to collect the security capabilities of nodes, which will be one of the factors to form the routing topology, and use the routing programming capabilities to form a secure routing path. The BGP-LS protocol is extended to carry the security capabilities of the node. The controller collects topology information, forms a topology path with security capabilities according to security requirements, and supports SRv6 path sending to execute node forwarding through programming.</t>
