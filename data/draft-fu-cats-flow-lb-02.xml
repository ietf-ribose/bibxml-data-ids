    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a flow-level load balancing solution for CATS, and is designed to effectively manage CS-ID traffic by addressing issues like frequent control plane operations and uneven use of computing resources. The approach entails concurrently identifying multiple next-hop choices, factoring in both network pathways and service instances. Traffic is then distributed among these service instances using flow-based load balancing, which relies on the five- tuple characteristics of packets.</t>
