    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes an extension to the base Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol to support bottleneck structures as an efficient representation of the state of a network. Bottleneck structures are efficient computational graphs that allow network operators and application service providers to optimize application performance in a variety of communication problems including routing, flow control, flow scheduling, bandwidth prediction, and network slicing, among others. This document introduces a new abstraction called Bottleneck Structure Graph (BSG) and the necessary requirements to integrate it into the ALTO standard.</t>
