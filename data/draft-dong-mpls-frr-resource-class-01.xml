      <t>This document describes simple and backward compatible extensions to Fast-Reroute (FRR) MPLS Traffic Engineering (TE). The purpose of these extensions include the following. These extensions provide a classification of SRLG to support LSP with differing protection requirements. These extensions allow highly reliable nodes or links, typically resources with redundancy at a lower layer, to be identified to allow LSP to optionally not consider these resources as potential points of failure.</t>
