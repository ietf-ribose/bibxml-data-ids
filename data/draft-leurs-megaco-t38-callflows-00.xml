      <t>This document describes the handling of realtime fax calls inMegaco/H.248 controlled MGs. The call setup and capabilitynegotiation is done with support of the control domain with Megacocommands. The switch over to fax or modem, upon detection of therelevant tones, is done in an autonomous way, without interventionof the control domain.In the Appendix, the Megaco messages for a call setup scenario withcapability negotiation are shown, to point out the structure of theto the transmitting MG. Switching to T.38 is done after reception ofV.21 flags.In the other flows, T.38 is not enabled, both MGs switch to thefallback case, fax pass-through mode.This document is based on the superior framework (reference [2]).The reader should be familiar with [2].SDP sessions in the local and remote descriptors.Call flow diagrams are given as example:In the first flow, a T.30 CNG tone is generated by the transmittingterminal, the transmitting MG signals the detection towards thereceiving MG. Switching to T.38 is done by both MGs as soon aspossible.In the second example, a T.30 CED tone is sent by the receivingterminal. As this tone is no clear indication that a FAX will besent, the receiving MG will switch to VBD after signaling this event</t>
