      <t>This paper discusses some of the issues in addressing plan for IPv7. It is not exhaustive. There are a variety of issues which are not dealt with in this paper and remain topics of future deliberation. This is a general discussion in the sense that it delineates guidelines for addressing under IPv7 and proposes the global infrastructure for addressing, but it explicitly delegates details of the addressing plan to appropriate local authorities.</t>
