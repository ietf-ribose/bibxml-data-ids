      <t>The goal of this document is to facilitate interoperability and automation by profiling the Certificate Management Protocol (CMP) version 2, the related Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) version 2, and the HTTP Transfer for the Certificate Management Protocol. It specifies a subset of CMP and CRMF focusing on typical use cases relevant for managing certificates of devices in many industrial and IoT scenarios. To limit the overhead of certificate management for more constrained devices only the most crucial types of operations are specified as mandatory. To foster interoperability in more complex scenarios, other types of operations are specified as recommended or optional.</t>
