      <t>This document captures initial thoughts about having IETF meetings that are completely virtual. It explores the issues involved with both a "planned" virtual meeting and an "emergency" virtual meeting. The intent is to evolve this document to provide answers to the questions posed throughout the text. This is currently a thought experiment. There are no current plans to hold a completely virtual IETF meeting.</t>
