      <t>The IETF Standards Track solution for MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection is provided in RFCs 6378, 7271, and 7324. This document describes the pre-standard implementation of MPLS-TP Linear Protection that has been deployed by several network operators using equipment from multiple vendors. At the time of publication, these pre-standard implementations were still in operation carrying live traffic. The specified mechanism supports 1+1 unidirectional/bidirectional protection switching and 1:1 bidirectional protection switching. It is purely supported by the MPLS-TP data plane and can work without any control plane.</t>
