      <t>This specification describes a protocol for a Shared Registry System (SRS) that allows multiple registrars to register domain names within a single Top Level Domain (TLD). The protocol is high-level, text-based, and can be used over many underlying transport mechanisms, including email. The semantic content of the protocol is expressed as a set of keyword-value pairs; the semantics and structure of this content is, in this document, loosely described as the 'payload'. The protocol described herein is essentially identical to the SRS version 1.5 protocol, specified by the CORE SRS RFP and developed by Curt Meyer of Emergent Corporation.</t>
