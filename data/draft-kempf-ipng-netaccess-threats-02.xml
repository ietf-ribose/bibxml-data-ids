      <t>The Mobile IP Working Group has been conducting a threat analysis for the purpose of securing specific Mobile IPv6 mechanisms. In the process of conducting the analysis, threats were identified that are not specific to Mobile IP but that are amplified by the nature of mobility. These threats are likely to be more or less of an issue within any Public Multi-Access network, regardless of whether mobility is involved. This document discusses threats associated with Public Multi-Access links in IPv6. The document covers non- Mobile IP specific threats uncovered by the Mobile IPv6 study, threats raised in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery and Stateless Address Autoconfiguration RFCs that have yet to be adequately addressed, and new threats that have not previously been identified.</t>
