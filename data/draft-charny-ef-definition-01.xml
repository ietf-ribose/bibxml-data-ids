      <t>This document proposes text aiming at providing clarification to RFC2598. The primary motivation for this draft is that the definitionof EF PHB given in RFC 2598 does not match the intuition of the EFPHB, and has been determined to be unimplementable in a mannercompliant with the definition. In particular, no work-conservingscheduler, including all of the schedulers listed in theImplementation Examples section of RFC 2598, can comply with thedefinition given in that RFC.This draft gives a rigorous definition of EF PHB which in ouropinion preserves the spirit of the EF PHB as intended by RFC 2598while allowing a number of reasonable compliant implementations. Thedocument also provides implementation guidance and lists severalpossible implementation examples which conform to the definitiongiven in this draft.</t>
