      <t>This document describes a new Phase I mode for IKE [RFC-2409] based on the ISAKMP [RFC-2408] Base Exchange. The purpose of this new exchange is to allow support of all authentication methods with fixed and non-fixed IP addresses, while offering protection against a denial of service attack aimed at costly operations. It also enables negotiation capabilities beyond those offered by Aggressive Mode (DH/EC group). The exchange consists of only four messages and therefor is useful when performance is crucial.</t>
