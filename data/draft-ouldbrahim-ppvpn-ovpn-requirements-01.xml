      <t>This document addresses service requirements for provider provisioned optical virtual private network The intent of this document is to include the OVPN work as part of PPVPN charter. A VPN service model based on optical connectivity has a lot of functional elements in common with other models already chartered in PPVPN. Inclusion of this topic in the charter will facilitate convergence and maximize reusability of common techniques to provide VPN service functions independently of the VPN connectivity level. That is also a global objective of the PPVPN standardization effort.</t>
