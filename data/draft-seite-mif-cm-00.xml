      <t>There is currently a need to present a coherent connection management behaviour for different terminal platforms (e.g. mobile phones, PCs, tablets, etc.). This document discusses how a connection manager can use the MIF API to provide this coherent behaviour and enhance the end user's experience when a terminal is able to connect to multiple interfaces. The goal of this document is not to define a connection manager specification, but to focus on the interaction with the MIF API and suggest relevant generic messages for the interface. This document is for discussion and its intention is to help clarifying the utilization of the MIF API in a connection management context and propose some relevant considerations.</t>
