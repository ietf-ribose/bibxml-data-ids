    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the Open Trust Protocol (OTrP), a protocol to install, update, and delete applications in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and to manage their security configuration. TEEs are used in environments where security services should be isolated from a regular operating system (often called rich OS). This form of compartmentalization grants a smaller codebase access to security sensitive services and restricts communication from the rich OS to those security services via mediated access.</t>
