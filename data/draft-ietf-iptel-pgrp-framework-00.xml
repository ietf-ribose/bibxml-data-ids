      <t>Within the ITU H.323 recommendation, the gatekeeper is a central point of communication for H.323 elements within a zone. All elements within the zone establish a communication channel with the gatekeeper over a registration, admission, and status (RAS) channel. Elements within a zone register with the gatekeeper and are subsequently able to communicate with other elements in the zone, or outside of the zone. What is needed in addition to the normal registration and connection admission procedures of H.323 is a means of acquiring information about elements in other zones. This document describes the framework for a peer gatekeeper routing protocol (pgrp) which allows gatekeepers to exchange information with other gatekeepers about elements in their respective zones. PGRP is a protocol supports the exchange of information among gatekeepers which may be used to make call routing decisions in a network. PGRP attempts to extend reliability concepts from telecommunications by incorporating maintenance state information exchange. This allows call routing decisions to be based upon the operational state of elements in the network. This feature is particularly useful in the H.323 gatekeeper mediated call model where a call may be completed to a pool of connection endpoints. An example of such a scenario is in the use of an H.323 to connect telecom end offices which connect to multiple H.323 gateways. In this context, pgrp is also able to support call distribution to balance the call load among the connection gateways serving an end office.</t>
