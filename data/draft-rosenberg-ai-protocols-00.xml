    <abstract>
      <t>AI Agents are software applications that utilize Large Language Models (LLM)s to interact with humans (or other AI Agents) for purposes of performing tasks. AI Agents can make use of resources - including APIs and documents - to perform those tasks, and are capable of reasoning about which resources to use. To facilitate AI agent operation, AI agents need to communicate with users, and then interact with other resources over the Internet, including APIs and other AI agents. This document describes a framework for AI Agent communications on the Internet, identifying the various protocols that come into play. It introduces use cases that motivate features and functions that need to be present in those protocols. It also provides a brief survey of existing work in standardizing AI agent protocols, including the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the Agent to Agent Protocol (A2A) and the Agntcy Framework, and describes how those works fit into this framework. The primary objective of this document is to set the stage for possible standards activity at the IETF in this space.</t>
