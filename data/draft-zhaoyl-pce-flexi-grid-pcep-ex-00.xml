      <t>Flexi-grid networks overcomes the fixed grid channel of Wavelength Switched Optical Network(WSON) by flexible spectrum to allow non- uniform and dynamic allocation of spectrum based on the demand of the incoming services' LSP. Flexi-grid networks is an effective solution to solve the problem of efficient spectrum utilization. Because the client LSP needs to be assigned contiguous spectrum in flexi-grid networks, there will be two problems that would affect spectrum utilization, i.e. RSA and fragmentation. We introduce two kinds of methods which can improve the spectrum utilization further, and some related PCEP extensions are defined in this document.</t>
