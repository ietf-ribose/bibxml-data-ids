      <t>This document describes the format of the data returned by a TimeStamp Authority and the protocols to be used when communicating with it.The time stamping service can be used as a Trusted Third Party (TTP) asone component in building reliable non-repudiation services (see[ISONR]). In order to reduce the amount of trust required of a TSA weintroduce (in Appendix C) the optional Temporal Data Authority (TDA)whose function is to provide further corroborating evidence of the timecontained in the token. We also give an example of how to place asignature at a particular point in time, from which the appropriatecertificate status information (e.g. CRLs) may be checked.</t>
