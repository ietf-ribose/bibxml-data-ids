      <t>IPv6 mobility [5] has many security requirements which can beroughly divided into security of signaling with commoncorrespondent nodes [6] and security between the mobile node andits home agent. If IPsec [1] is not so usable in the first caseit remains the solution of choice in the second. UnfortunatelyIPsec does not allow reasonable performance in some commonsituations. One of the main problems is the lack of integrationwith a modern network access service security like the one providedby AAA [7].</t>
