      <t>IPv6 mobility [5] has many security requirements which can be roughly divided into security of signaling with common correspondent nodes [6] and security between the mobile node and its home agent. If IPsec [1] is not so usable in the first case it remains the solution of choice in the second. Unfortunately IPsec does not allow reasonable performance in some common situations. One of the main problems is the lack of integration with a modern network access service security like the one provided by AAA [7].</t>
