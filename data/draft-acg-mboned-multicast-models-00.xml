    <abstract>
      <t>The draft provides a high-level overview of multicast service and deployment models, principally the Any-Source Multicast (ASM) and Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) models, and aims to provoke discussion of applicability of the models to certain scenarios. This initial draft is by no means comprehensive. Comments on the initial content, and what further content would be appropriate, or indeed whether the draft is of value, are welcomed.</t>
