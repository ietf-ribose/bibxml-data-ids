      <t>In this memo, we present a new differentiated service scheme called ''User-Share Differentiation (USD)''. The USD scheme is based on the principle of link sharing. The scheme allows ISPs to differentiate traffic flows on a per-user basis, providing minimum bandwidth guar- antee and share-based bandwidth sharing. We first look at the objec- tives of differentiated services, and the problems with the current proposals, then present the details of the USD scheme. Finally we examine the implementation and standardization issues</t>
