    <abstract>
      <t>Various tunnel based methods have been developed to realize BANdwidth Aggregation for interNet Access (BANANA). At the egress point of bonding tunnels, packets that have been delivered through different tunnels are reordered in a bonding reordering buffer. Along each tunnel, network devices may set aside buffers, which are referred as tunnel buffers, to cache packets as well. This document exposes that a time boundary, which is referred as "Discard Timer", imposed on tunnel buffers could improve the throughput and reliability of the bonding tunnels.</t>
