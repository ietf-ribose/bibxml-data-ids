    <title>Administration of SNMP Communities</title>
    <date year="1990" month="July"/>
    <abstract>
      <t>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) specification allows for the authentication of management operations by a variety of authentication algorithms. This memo defines two strategies for administering SNMP communities based upon either the SNMP authentication algorithm or the SNMP authentication and privacy algorithm. Insofar as the administration of SNMP communities based upon the trivial authentication algorithm may be realized by straightforward application of familiar network management techniques, administration of such communities is not directly addressed in this memo.</t>
