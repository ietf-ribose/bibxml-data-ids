      <t>While RFC 2865 defines the Filter-Id attribute, it requires that the Network Access Server (NAS) be pre-populated with the desired filters. However, in situations where the server operator does not know which filters have been pre-populated, it is useful to specify filter rules explicitly. This document defines the NAS-Filter-Rule attribute within the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS). This attribute is based on the Diameter NAS-Filter-Rule Attribute Value Pair (AVP) described in RFC 4005, and the IPFilterRule syntax defined in RFC 3588. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
