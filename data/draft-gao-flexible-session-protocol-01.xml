      <t>FSP is a connection-oriented transport layer protocol that provides mobility and multihoming support by introducing the concept of 'upper layer thread ID', which is associated with some shared secret that is applied to protect authenticity of the origin of the FSP packets. It introduces the concept of transmit transaction to facilitate a quad-party sub-protocol for shared secret installation. It provides transport layer features of zero round-trip connection multiplication and on-the-wire compression, in addition to ubiquitous message authentication with optional encryption service.</t>
