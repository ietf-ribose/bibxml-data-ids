      <t>There is heightened concern about the growth of the global routingtable and the increased frequency of routing table updates. Both isdue to the use of provider-independent addressing space in edgenetworks, which accommodates operators' desire to move trafficquickly and easily from one provider to another. The main recentproposals attempt to solve this problem by hiding provider-independent addressing space through a level of indirection.Unfortunately, indirection requires a non-trivial distribution ofaddress translation information across the Internet. This is eitherslow, or costly in terms of signaling overhead, or both. Securityand transitionability are further issues. This document proposes analternative solution, which is based on a single, provider-dependentaddressing space and hence avoids the problems of indirection. Thesolution meets the objectives of edge network operators whilelimiting the size of the routing table and its update frequency.</t>
