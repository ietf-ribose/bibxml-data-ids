      <t>This document specifies a new mechanism using 6to4 to solve mobility problems in IPv4 and IPv6 interconnected networks. This draft is based on the Architecture of Hierarchical Dual Stack Mobility Agent(HDSMA) that supports the IP version-independent mobility of mobile node and improves the registration efficiency and the performance[3]. The aim is to support 6to4 mechanism for IPv6 transition while mobile node only uses mobile IPv6 capability for mobility services.</t>
