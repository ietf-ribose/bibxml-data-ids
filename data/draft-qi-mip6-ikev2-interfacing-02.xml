    <abstract>
      <t>This draft discusses the issues associated with interfacing between IKEv2/IPsec and MIPv6. When mobile nodes bootstrap in foreign network or handover to a new network, IKEv2/IPsec can not probe the changing of care-of-address, which is related security associations. One simple extension to the SADB_ACQUIRE in PF_KEY framework is proposed to support this interfacing. And the operation modification of IKEv2 and MIPv6 are described in this proposal based on the SADB_ACQUIRE extension. A new mobility security reference database is created to store the temporary mobility parameters.</t>
