      <t>This draft specifies SWAN, a stateless network protocol which uses distributed control algorithms to deliver service differentiation in MANETs. SWAN uses rate control for UDP and TCP best-effort traffic, and source-based admission control for UDP real-time traffic. SWAN also uses explicit congestion control notification (ECN) to dynamically regulate admitted real-time traffic in the face of network dynamics brought on by mobility or traffic overload conditions. SWAN is designed to support real-time services over best effort MACs without the need to install and maintain costly QOS state at MANET nodes. This makes the SWAN approach to MANET QOS simple, scalable, and robust. The ns-2 simulation code is available from the web http://comet.columbia.edu/swan/).</t>
