    <abstract>
      <t>This draft describes some potential new privacy requirements for the future network. We start from the data lifecycle and propose that the privacy needs to be considered during the data is processing. We also introduce some new academic research results. Some use cases are proposed. The goal is to attract IETF working or interest groups in researching to these new requirements in protocol level for the future network.</t>
