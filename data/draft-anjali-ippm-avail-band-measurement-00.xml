      <t>Available bandwidth along a path is an important metric that can beuseful to provide insight into the state and performance of thenetwork. Some methods have been proposed in literature formeasurement of available bandwidth but they face the problems ofscalability and high intrusiveness. In this draft, we propose amethod to measure path available bandwidth using an active approachthat probes the path. The probing mechanism used is based on TCPNew Reno. Once the samples for the available bandwidth measurementare obtained, more accurate results are calculated using aprediction filter.</t>
