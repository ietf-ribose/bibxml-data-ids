      <t>Available bandwidth along a path is an important metric that can be useful to provide insight into the state and performance of the network. Some methods have been proposed in literature for measurement of available bandwidth but they face the problems of scalability and high intrusiveness. In this draft, we propose a method to measure path available bandwidth using an active approach that probes the path. The probing mechanism used is based on TCP New Reno. Once the samples for the available bandwidth measurement are obtained, more accurate results are calculated using a prediction filter.</t>
