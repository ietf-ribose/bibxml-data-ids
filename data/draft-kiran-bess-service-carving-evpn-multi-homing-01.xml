      <t>This document proposes a new approach for the Designated Forwarder (DF) selection algorithm. This is besides the existing algorithm types discussed in RFC7432 and RFC8584. A DF is a PE part of an Ethernet-Segment, forwarding BUM traffic to multi-homed hosts. This document discusses methods to achieve efficient service carving in Evpn Multi-homed networks by extending the DF selection algorithm type in RFC7432 by suggesting a new approach for service carving.</t>
