      <t>The goal of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) is toprovide guidance to applications, which have to select one or severalhosts from a set of candidates, which are able to provide the desiredresource. Now the members in alto group propose many solutions, suchas P4P and PROXIDOR. These solutions still have unsolved problemsregarding privacy and workload. The privacy and load issues arecrucial aspects for the benefits of ISP and P2P.This draft is to do acomparative study to analyze and compare the privacy and workload ofseveral existing solutions, hence to provide guidance in order toimprove, optimize and deploy the protocol.</t>
