      <t>The IPP event notification specification [ipp-ntfy] is an OPTIONALextension to IPP/1.0, IPP/1.1, and future versions. [ipp-ntfy] whichenables IPP clients to request notification of printer and job events.The IPP notification extension gives IPP Printers the flexibility tochoose how many Subscriptions objects (individual requests fornotification), what delivery methods, and what natural languages tosupport, among others. In practice, it's the working environment wherean IPP Printer is deployed what ultimately dictates the notificationrequirements for that printer. Notification Delivery Services exist tohelp event producers, such as IPP Printers, meet the varyingnotification needs of disparate environments. Specifically, an IPPNotification Delivery Service may extend the notification capabilitiesof IPP Printers and help customize the type of notification required ina highly specialized environment. This documents defines the IPPNotification Delivery Protocol (INDP), a protocol for IPP Printers tocommunicate with Notification Delivery Services using 'application/ipp'as the encoding mechanism and HTTP as the transport. The definition ofINDP lends itself nicely for use by IPP Printers and NotificationDelivery Services for dispatching IPP Notifications to NotificationRecipients as well.</t>
