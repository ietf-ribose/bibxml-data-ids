      <t>The United States government has published the NSA Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) Suite, which defines cryptographic algorithm policy for national security applications. This document specifies a profile of the Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) protocol for managing X.509 public key certificates in applications using the CNSA Suite. It is a refinement of RFCs 5272, 5273, and 5274. The profile applies to the capabilities, configuration, and operation of all components of US National Security Systems that manage X.509 public key certificates over CMS. US National Security Systems are described in NIST Special Publication SP-800-59. It is also appropriate for all other US Government systems that process high-value information. It is made publicly available for use by developers and operators of these and any other system deployments.</t>
