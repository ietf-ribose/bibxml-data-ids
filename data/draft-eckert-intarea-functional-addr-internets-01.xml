      <t>Recent work has raised interest in exploring network layer addressing that is more flexible than fixed-length addressing as used in IPv4 (32 bit) and IPv6 (128 bit). The reasons for the interest include both support for multiple and potentially novel address semantics, but also optimizations of addressing for existing semantics such as unicast tailored not for the global Internet but to better support private networks / limited domains. This memo explores in the view of the author yet little explored reasons for more flexible addresses namely the problems and opportunities for Internetworking with Independent Network Address Spaces (IINAS). To better enable such internetworks, this memo proposes a framework for a Functional Addressing model. This model also intends to support several other addressing goals including programmability and multiple semantics.</t>
