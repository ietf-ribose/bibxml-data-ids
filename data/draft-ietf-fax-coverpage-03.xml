      <t>In traditional GSTN-based fax, a coverpage is often sent before the actual document. Some of the uses for a coverpage are: o routing the document to the correct recipient o identifying the sender o providing comments to the recipient about the document o page count o transmission date Current fax-over-SMTP aware applications do not have a standard way to indicate that a coverpage has been included with a message, or that there is a good possibilty that a coverpage is part of the message. This memo provides a mechanism to indicate that a coverpage has been included or has probably incluced in a message.</t>
