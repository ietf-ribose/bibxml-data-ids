Some of the uses for a coverpage are:o routing the document to the correct recipiento identifying the sendero providing comments to the recipient about the documento page counto transmission dateCurrent fax-over-SMTP aware applications do not have a standard wayto indicate that a coverpage has been included with a message, or thatthere is a good possibilty that a coverpage is part of the message.This memo provides a mechanism to indicate that a coverpage has beenincluded or has probably incluced in a message.</t>
