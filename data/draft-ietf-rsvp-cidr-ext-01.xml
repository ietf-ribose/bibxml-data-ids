      <t>This document presents extensions to Version 1 of the Resource Reservation Setup Protocol (RSVP). These extensions ameliorate RSVP support of Large Scale Multicast Applications (LSMA) and Virtual Private Networks (VPN). With these types of applications, several hosts at any particular site are participating in a session. Efficient RSVP use requires aggregation of their addresses into a single entry for classification purposes. The extensions allow such aggregation of state in a simple manner that requires no changes to the base RSVP specification.</t>
