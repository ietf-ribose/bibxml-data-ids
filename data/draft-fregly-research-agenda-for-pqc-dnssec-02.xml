    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a notional research agenda for collaborative multi-stakeholder research related to a future post-quantum DNSSEC ecosystem. It is inspired by the anticipation that adoption of Post- Quantum signature algorithms will have enough operational impact on DNSSEC that either DNS protocol enhancements will be needed, or DNS will move away from UDP as the prevalent DNS transport, or a combination of both will be needed. Some members of the DNS technical community have even suggested evaluating alternatives to DNSSEC and potentially adopting an alternative protocol or practices to assure the integrity of DNS responses. Given the potential impact of such changes on the DNS ecosystem, the authors believe collaborative multi-stakeholder research into the impact of proposed changes should be performed to inform adoption and standardization activities.</t>
