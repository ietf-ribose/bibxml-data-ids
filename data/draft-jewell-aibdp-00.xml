      <t>This document defines the AI Boundary Declaration Protocol (AIBDP), a declarative framework for expressing usage boundaries around web- hosted content in relation to AI systems. It builds on the mechanisms of RFC 2196 and RFC 9116, as well as on the HTTP semantics of RFC 9110 and the robots-style inclusion rules of RFC 7725, to provide machine-readable permissions and denials for indexing, training, mimicry, representation, derivative construction, analytical exploitation, and agentic access. AIBDP supports ethical infrastructure, agentic AI governance, and procedural clarity across the Internet.</t>
