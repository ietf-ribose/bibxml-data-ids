      <t>This document defines an authenticated key agreement method for the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol version 1.3. The authentication method requires that the server (and optionally client) is pre-provisioned with a unique long-term static asymmetric Finite Field Diffie-Hellman (DH) or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) keypair; the peer must be able to obtain the public key of the endpoint via an out-of-band mechanism (e.g. pre-provisioning). The handshake provides ephemeral (EC)DH keys, and a common key schedule is agreed using Double- or Triple-(EC)DH. Confirmation of knowledge of the key schedule provides server (and optionally client) authentication.</t>
