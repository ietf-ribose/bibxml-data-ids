    <abstract>
      <t>Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) control allows each network element (NE) to perform resource discovery, routing and signaling in a distributed manner. On the other hand, with the development of software-defined transport networking technology, central controllers are introduced to transport networks to control a set of NEs. In transport networks, the GMPLS control has many mature mechanisms such as RSVP-TE, OSPF-TE, and LMP, so that GMPLS can be applied for the NE-level control in the centralized controller systems. This document describes how GMPLS control interworks with centralized controller systems (e.g. ACTN) in transport network.</t>
