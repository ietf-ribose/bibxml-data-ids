      <t>The new Smart Energy (SE) Version 2 (SE 2) is aimed at providing end- to-end connectivity between energy providers, energy consumers, and their respective equipment. This effort has been recognized as part of the Smart Grid roadmap by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Whereas SE 1 was based on a proprietary ZigBee stack, SE 2 will is based on IPv6 with support for IEEE 802.15.4, HomePlug and use across the Internet. The work in 6LowApp on application protocols and commissioning is an important component of SE 2. This document introduces SE 2 along with requirements identified for 6LowApp and considerations for future work.</t>
