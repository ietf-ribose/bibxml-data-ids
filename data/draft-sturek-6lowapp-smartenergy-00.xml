This effort has been recognized as partof the Smart Grid roadmap by the US National Institute of Standardsand Technology (NIST). Whereas SE 1 was based on a proprietaryZigBee stack, SE 2 will is based on IPv6 with support for IEEE802.15.4, HomePlug and use across the Internet. The work in 6LowAppon application protocols and commissioning is an important componentof SE 2.
