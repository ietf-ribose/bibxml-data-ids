      <t>In some network topologies, it is preferred to have a trusted networkelement between the DHCP client and the L3 relay agent that adds theDHCP relay-agent-information option but does not set the giaddrfield. They operate in Layer 2 mode and hence act as trusted Layer 2relay agents. The replies from the server are broadcasted by the L3relay agents to these L2 relay agents which must be avoided. Thisdocument defines a new sub-option for the relay-agent-informationoption. With this sub-option, the L3 relay agent will always unicastthe messages towards the trusted layer 2 DHCP relay agent with ahardware address that is known in the network. The new sub-option iscalled the "unicast-address" sub-option.</t>
