      <t>This document defines the format of network news articles. Network news articles resemble mail messages but are broadcast to potentially large audiences, using a flooding algorithm that propagates one copy to each interested host (or group thereof), typically stores only one copy per host, and does not require any central administration or systematic registration of interested users. Network news originated as the medium of communication for Usenet, circa 1980. Since then Usenet has grown explosively, and many Internet sites participate in it. In addition, the news technology is now in widespread use for other purposes, on the Internet and elsewhere. This document defines the format of network news articles in the context of the Internet Message Format, and adds Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) support for multimedia and internationalized message bodies.</t>
