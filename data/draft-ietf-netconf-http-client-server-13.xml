    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines two YANG modules: the first defines a minimal grouping for configuring an HTTP client, and the second defines a minimal grouping for configuring an HTTP server. It is intended that these groupings will be used to help define the configuration for simple HTTP-based protocols (not for complete web servers or browsers).

This text is sourced from a file in a context where it is unknown how many modules a draft defines. The text is not wrong as is, but it may be improved by stating more directly how many modules are defined. The "Relation to other RFCs" section Section 1.1 contains a self- reference to this draft, along with a corresponding Informative Reference in the Appendix. The following Appendix section is to be removed prior to publication: * Appendix A. Change Log</t>
