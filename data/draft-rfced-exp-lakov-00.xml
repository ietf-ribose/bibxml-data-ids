      <t>This document provides a proposal for a new Internet protocol, which should improve the relevance of results of search requests for information in the WWW. It contains a description of the basic model and the minimum set of commands necessary to run properly. It is neither meant to nor should be regarded as a definitive version, but rather as a suggestion to a new way of looking at the relations between the search engines on one hand and hosts running WEB servers on the other.</t>
