    <abstract>
      <t>The evolution from Level 3 (assisted automation) to Level 4 (autonomous self-optimization) in Autonomous Networks (AN) introduces requirements for Agentic capabilities, including intent-based reasoning, autonomous planning, and context-aware decision-making, which transcend the static, rule-based logic of traditional SDN Controllers. This document defines the concept of the Network Management Agent (NMA), an AI-driven entity designed to embody these cognitive functions and bridge the gap between service intent and network operations. This document also specifies how the NMA utilizes the existing capabilities of SDN Controllers—such as topology management, telemetry, and enforcement—to achieve Autonomous L4 without duplicating policy control functions. It further details the architectural integration modes and defines the interface requirements necessary for SDN Controllers to interoperate with NMAs.</t>
