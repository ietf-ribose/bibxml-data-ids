      <t>This document extends PASSporT, a token for conveying cryptographically-signed call information about personal communications, to include rich data that can be transmitted and subsequently rendered to users, extending identifying information beyond human-readable display name comparable to the "Caller ID" function common on the telephone network. The element defined for this purpose, Rich Call Data (RCD), is an extensible object defined to either be used as part of STIR or with SIP Call-Info to include related information about calls that helps people decide whether to pick up the phone. This signing of the RCD information is also enhanced with an integrity mechanism to optionally protect the handling of this information between authoritative and non- authoritative parties authoring and signing the Rich Call Data for support of different usage and content policies.</t>
