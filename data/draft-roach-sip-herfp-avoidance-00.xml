      <t>The processing of SIP reqeusts by certain types of proxies can lead to situations in which multiple non-sucessful responses are generated, only one of which is ultimately reported to the originator of the response. In many cases, these non-successful responses indicate conditions that can be addressed by the requestor, and then retried; therefore, the elision of them by proxies can lead to a decrease in the rechability of certain network entites. This document defines a mechanism that can be employed to avoid the dropping of such requests with minimal implementation complexity.</t>
