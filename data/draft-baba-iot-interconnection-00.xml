      <t>This paper describes issues for solutions through cloud inter- connection to structural problems, which are called as "silo effects" found in cloud-connected electric home appliances, housing equipment and sensors in the face of increasingly accelerated connection of them. Specifically, this paper explains an inter-connection agreement considered to be required for enhancement of cloud inter- connection, what performance guarantee as well as IoT supervising and management should be, necessity of inter-connection HUB which is able to provide inter-connection amongst the preponderance of private cloud groups.</t>
