      <t>Autonomous agents such as LLM-powered crawlers, browser-integrated assistants, and task-oriented bots are rapidly becoming first-class HTTP clients on the Web. Today’s infrastructure largely assumes a human behind a browser and monetizes content through advertising and coarse subscriptions. Automated agents consume content at scale without rendering pages or viewing ads, exacerbating bot-mitigation arms races and economic misalignment between content providers and AI systems. This document describes an HTTP Agent Profile (HAP) that enables: (1) cryptographic authentication of agent traffic using HTTP Message Signatures; (2) clear separation between human and agent traffic using privacy-preserving human tokens; and (3) protocol-level value exchange for agents via HTTP status code 402 ("Payment Required") and pluggable micropayment mechanisms. The profile reuses existing HTTP features and is designed for incremental deployment via reverse proxies, CDNs, and agent libraries.</t>
