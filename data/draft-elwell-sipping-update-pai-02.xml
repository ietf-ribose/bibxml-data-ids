      <t>SIP has a mechanism for conveying the asserted identity of theoriginator of a request by means of the P-Asserted-Identity headerfield. This header field is specified for use in requests using anumber of SIP methods, in particular the INVITE method. However, RFC3325 does not specify the insertion of this header field by a trustedUAC, does not specify the use of this header field with the SIPUPDATE, MESSAGE or PUBLISH methods, and is unclear on the use of thisheader field in responses. This document extends RFC 3325 to coverthese situations.This work is being discussed on the sipping@ietf.org mailing list.</t>
