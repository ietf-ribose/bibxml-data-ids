      <t>This document describes a unified IPv6 transition framework. This framework makes use of the flow-based packet forwarding technology, which can simplify the implementation of both control plane and data plane operations of transition mechanisms. The purpose of this work is to provide an integrated and flexible framework to implement and deploy the most popular translation and tunneling mechanisms, such as NAT64, DS-Lite, Lightweight 4over6 and MAP-E. This framework can benefit the industry by reducing the cost of implementation, providing flexibility for deployment, and enabling transition mechanisms to coexist and cooperate in the common infrastructure.</t>
