      <t>This document describes the general problem of network stratum queryfor application optimization. Network Stratum query is an ability toquery the network from an application controller such as those usedin Data Centers so that application controller decisions such asserver assignment or virtual machine instantiation/migration could beperformed with better knowledge of the underlying network conditions.As application servers are distributed geographically across DataCenters, many application-related decisions such as which server toassign a new client or where to instantiate/migrate virtual machineswill suffer from sub-optimality unless the underlying networkconditions are factored in the decision process. The lack of networkawareness may result in not meeting the end-user service objectivefor some key applications like video gaming/conferencing that requirestringent latency and bandwidth requirement.</t>
