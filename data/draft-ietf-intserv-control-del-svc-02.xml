      <t>This memo describes the network element behavior required to deliver Controlled Delay service in the Internet. Controlled delay service provides three levels of delay control; network elements, when overloaded, are required to control delay by denying service requests. However, there are no quantitative assurances about the absolute level of delay provided. The controlled delay service is designed for service-adaptive and delay-adaptive applications; i.e., applications that are prepared to dynamically adapt to changing packet transmission delays and to dynamically change the level of packet delivery delay control they request from the network when their current level of service is not adequate. The controlled delay service imposes relatively minimal requirements on network components that implement it, and is intended to be usable in situations ranging from small centrally managed private IP networks to the global Internet. This specification follows the service specification template described in [1].</t>
