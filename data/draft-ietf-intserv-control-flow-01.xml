      <t>Controlled-Load Service provides data flows with an enhanced quality of service, in the form of low packet delay and a low probability of packet loss even under congestion. A network element providing Controlled-Load Service can use an admission control algorithm to limit the number of data flows receiving the service. In this document we describe an admission control algorithm for Controlled- Load Service. This algorithm is not intended for IETF standardization. Rather, it is presented for informational purposes only. We also present a reference implementation framework for the measurement-based admission control algorithm. Our implementation separates the measurement from the actual admission control decision to provide the flexibility of using different algorithms in bandwidth estimation and admission control.</t>
