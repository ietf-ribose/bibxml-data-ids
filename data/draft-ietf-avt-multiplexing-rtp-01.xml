    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes a light-weight data driven approach for multiplexing low bit rate RTP streams at the edge router of the Internet in order to reduce the RTP/UDP/IP header overhead associated with each RTP stream. Audio packets from different sources in a local access network destined to different users in the same remote access network are multiplexed into one packet, with the original RTP/UDP/IP header of each packet replaced with a mini-header (2 bytes), resulting in a reduction of the overhead. Access routers can use the IP telephony Border Gateway Protocol (TBGP) to exchange the reachability of IP destinations in their domains.</t>
