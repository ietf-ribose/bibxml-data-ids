      <t>This document describes a fully-specified simple FEC scheme for LDPC-staircase codes that can be used to protect media streams along thelines defined by the FECFRAME framework. These codes have manyinteresting properties: they are systematic codes, they perform closeto ideal codes in many use-cases and they also feature very highencoding and decoding throughputs. LDPC-Staircase codes aretherefore a good solution to protect a single high bitrate sourceflow, or to protect globally several mid-rate flows within a singleFECFRAME instance. They are also a good solution whenever theprocessing load of a software encoder or decoder must be kept to aminimum.</t>
