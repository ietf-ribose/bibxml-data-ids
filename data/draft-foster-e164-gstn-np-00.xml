      <t>This document provides an overview of E.164 telephone numberportability (NP) in the Global Switched Telephone Network (GSTN).There are three types of number portability: service provider numberportability (SPNP), location portability, and service portability.Service provider portability, the focus of the present draft, is aregulatory imperative in many countries seeking to liberalize localtelephony service competition, by enabling end-users to retain pre-existing telephone numbers while changing service providers.Implementation of NP within national GSTN entails potentiallysignificant changes to numbering administration, network elementsignaling, call routing and processing, billing, service management,and other functions. NP changes the fundamental nature of a dialedE.164 number from a hierarchical physical routing address to avirtual address, thereby requiring the transparent translation ofthe later to the former. In addition, there are various regulatoryconstraints which establish relevant parameters for NPimplementation, most of which are not network technology specific.Consequently, the implementation of NP behavior consistent withapplicable regulatory constraints, as well as the need forinteroperation with the existing GSTN NP implementations, arerelevant topics for numerous areas of IP telephony work-in-progressat IETF.</t>
