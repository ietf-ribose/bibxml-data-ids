      <t>A Traffic Engineering (TE) mesh-group is defined as a group of Label Switch Routers (LSRs) that are connected by a full mesh of TE LSPs. Routing (OSPF and IS-IS) extensions for discovery Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) LSR TE mesh membership has been defined to automate the creation of mesh of TE LSPs. This document introduces a role-based TE mesh-group that applies to the scenarios where full mesh TE LSPs is not necessary and TE LSPs setup depends on the roles of LSRs in a TE mesh-group. Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) routing extensions for automatic discovery of role-based TE mesh membership are defined accordingly.</t>
