      <t>This draft proposes a naming convention for encoding CIDR address blocks into the reverse DNS namespace. The reverse DNS naming method is commonly used to specify a complete IP address. This document describes how to encode an IPv4 or IPv6 CIDR address block such as 129.82.128.0/17. By defining a common naming convention, one can associate information with a prefix. The convention builds on past work in RFC 1101 that associates network names with prefixes. However, this previous work pre-dated the introduction of CIDR and has several critical ambiguities. This convention corrects the ambiguities and enables new applications ranging from routing information to geolocation.</t>
