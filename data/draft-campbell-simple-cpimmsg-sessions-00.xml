      <t>Instant Messaging (IM) refers to the transfer of messages betweenusers in near real-time. These messages are usually, but notrequired to be, short. IMs are often used in a conversational mode,that is, the transfer of messages back and forth is fast enough forparticipants to maintain an interactive conversation. Each messagecan be sent independently using the SIP MESSAGE method, or messagescan be associated into sessions that are initiated using SIP. Thefirst approach is often referred to as pager-mode messaging, due toits similarity to the behavior of two way pager devices. The secondapproach is often called session-mode messaging, or simply messagesessions. This document describes a message session mechanism basedon the Common Presence and Instant Messaging message format.</t>
