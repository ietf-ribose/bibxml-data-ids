      <t>The HTTP/2 spec requires that TLS renegotiation not be employed when the negotiated application protocol is HTTP/2. This document defines an extension to HTTP/2 which permits renegotiation to be employed by peers which mutually consent to do so, while allowing peers to understand whether renegotiation is permitted before attempting it.</t>
