      <t>Federated identity is typically associated with Web-based services at present, but there is growing interest in its application in non Web- based contexts. The goal of this document is to document a selection of the wide variety of these contexts whose user experience could be improved through the use of technologies based on the ABFAB architecture and specifications.</t>
