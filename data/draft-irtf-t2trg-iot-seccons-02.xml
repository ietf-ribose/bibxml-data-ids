      <t>The Internet of Things concept refers to the usage of standard Internet protocols to allow for human-to-thing or thing-to-thing communication. The security needs are well-recognized and and many standardization steps have been taken, for example, specification of CoAP over DTLS. However, security challenges still exist and there are some use cases that lack a suitable solution. This document first provides an overview of security architecture, its deployment model, security needs in the context of the lifecycle of a thing, as well as the state of the art on IoT security. Then, we discuss the concept of security profiles for the successful roll-out of secure IoT applications and describe remaining security challenges in the IoT.</t>
