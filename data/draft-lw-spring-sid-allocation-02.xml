      <t>Segment Routing (SR) allows for a flexible definition of end-to-end paths within IGP topologies by encoding paths as sequences of topological sub-paths, called "segments". These segments are advertised by the link-state routing protocols (IS-IS and OSPF). And a segment is identified by a Segment Routing ID (SID). This document proposes a method to reduce the SID configuration in a SR domain. Only the selected SR nodes which named Segment Routing Management Nodes (SRMNs) are configured by NMS, while other SRs in the domain need zero-SR-configuration.</t>
