      <t>Mechanism to discover a destination used to deliver user-supplied FBL reports to an original DKIM signer or other responsible parties. This should allow the reporting entity to deliver reports via email for each party which has affixed a validating DKIM signature. The discovery is made via DNS and the record is constructed using items within the DKIM signature in the message.</t>
