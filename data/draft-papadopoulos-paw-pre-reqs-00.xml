    <abstract>
      <t>Packet Replication and Elimination mechanism consists in duplicating data packets into several paths in the network to increase reliability and provide low jitter. Over a wireless medium, this technique can take advantage of communication overhearing, when parallel transmissions over two adjacent paths are scheduled. This document presents the concept and details the required changes to the current specifications that will be necessary to enable this.</t>
