      <t>This document specifies the changes that need to be made to the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to support SIPP hosts, and describes how a host makes use of this protocol and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Router Discovery messages to form locally and globally routable address sequences automatically. The changes to DHCP are intended to be minimal and compatible with existing BOOTP and DHCP clients. Modifications include a new message format and updated operation definitions. Communication between a SIPP client and server is made significantly simpler since relay agent functionality is not required.</t>
