    <abstract>
      <t>Instant Messaging has recently emerged as a new and highly popular medium of communication over the Internet, driven by the desire of individuals to know instantly whether another individual is online, to be notified when another individual arrives online, and to send messages in ‘real time’. These are all special cases of the more general problem of Internet-wide notification. The RVP protocol, is designed to enable such notifications and messages across a loosely coupled (federated) constellation of servers. RVP is designed to address the need for notification in a secure, reliable and scaleable fashion. RVP encompasses the client-server and server-server interactions. RVP is related to the work done by the IETF Instant Messaging and Presence Protocol Working group (IMPP). This protocol is not intended to compete with the IMPP effort, but to inform the design process with an existing implementation. This document reflects the actual Microsoft Exchange 2000 implementation.</t>
