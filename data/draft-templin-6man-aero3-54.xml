    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies an Automatic Extended Route Optimization (AERO) and mobility service for IP internetworking over Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI) Interfaces. AERO/OMNI use IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) control plane messaging over the OMNI virtual link to support secured network admission and OMNI link forwarding. Flow-based secure multilink path selection, multinet traversal, mobility management, multicast forwarding, multihop operation and route optimization are naturally supported through dynamic neighbor cache updates. AERO is a widely-applicable service well-suited for air/land/sea/space secure global mobile Internetworking applications including aviation, intelligent transportation systems, mobile end user devices, space exploration and many others.</t>
