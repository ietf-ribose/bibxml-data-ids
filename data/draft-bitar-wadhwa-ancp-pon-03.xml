      <t>The purpose of this document is to provide applicability of Access Node Control Mechanism, as described in [ANCP-FRAMEWORK], to PON based broadband access. The need for an Access Node Control Mechanism between a Network Access Server (NAS) and an Access Node Complex (a combination of Optical Line Termination (OLT) and Optical Network Termination (ONT) elements), is described in a multi-service reference architecture in order to perform QoS-related, service- related and Subscriber-related operations. The Access Node Control Mechanism is also extended for interaction between components of the Access Node Complex (OLT and ONT). The Access Node Control mechanism will ensure that the transmission of the information does not need to go through distinct element managers but rather uses a direct device- device communication. This allows for performing access link related operations within those network elements to meet performance objectives.</t>
