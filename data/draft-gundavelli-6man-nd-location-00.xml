    <abstract>
      <t>The physical location of a network device plays a crucial role in various applications, particularly in emergency calling, where precise caller location information is essential for prompt and effective emergency response. RFC 4676 has standardized DHCP options for delivering the Civic Location of the client, while RFC 6225 has defined DHCP options for delivering the Geospatial coordinates of the client. However, these corresponding options are missing in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocols. This proposal aims to address this gap by introducing the necessary options for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery to provide accurate location information.</t>
