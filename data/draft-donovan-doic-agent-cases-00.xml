    <abstract>
      <t>The Diameter Overload Information Conveyance (DOIC) solution describes a mechanism for exchanging information about Diameter Overload among Diameter nodes. A DOIC node is a Diameter node that acts as either a reporting node are a reacting node. A reporting node originates overload reports, requesting reacting nodes to reduce the amount of traffic sent. DOIC allows Diameter agents to act as reporting nodes, reacting nodes, or both, but does not describe agent behavior. This document explores several use cases for agents to participate in overload control, and makes recommendations for certain agent behaviors to be added to DOIC.</t>
