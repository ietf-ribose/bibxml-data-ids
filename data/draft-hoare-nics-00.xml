      <t>NICS is a proposed system which meets the requirements of large-scale, unique principal identification, for use in conjunction with an arbitrary set of security systems such as have been proposed by members of the IETF. This proposal outlines the motivation for the development of NICS, and gives a general description of its internal workings and interfaces with higher-level protocols. It should be emphasized up front that NICS is not a complete security system, nor does it aim to replace any existing components of the internet which already work. The design draws off the fact that many security systems already have flexible name schemes, and are therefore considered components which are used in conjunction with NICS to achieve an improved level of service, flexibility and reliability, while introducing many desirable features such as anonymous identifiers, self-optimization, and low-overhead operation. For the purpose of initial evaluation, the remainder of this paper is short and to the point, and requires a little work on the reader's side to understand the reasoning. Additional discussion is welcome on the mailing list.</t>
