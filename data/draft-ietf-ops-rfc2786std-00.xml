      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.In particular, it defines a textual convention for doing Diffie-Hellman key agreement key exchanges and a set of objects which extendthe usmUserTable to permit the use of a DH key exchange in additionto the key change method described in [14]. In other words, this MIBadds the possibility of forward secrecy to the USM model. It alsodefines a set of objects that can be used to kick start security onan SNMPv3 agent when the out of band path is authenticated, but notnecessarily private or confidential.The author is submitting this draft at the request of the O&amp;M areadirector. This memo revises and updates RFC 2786 [19] with the goalof moving the described protocol and MIB from Experimental toStandards Track. The one minor substantive change from theExperimental RFC is a restatement of the conditions on the selectionof the DH public number (see DHKeyChange and usmDHKickstartMyPublicin the body of the MIB as well as the MIBs revision history). Thespelling of 'Hellman' was corrected throughout. Author contactinformation was updated. Slight structural modifications were madeto more cleanly seperate boilerplate from substantive text.</t>
