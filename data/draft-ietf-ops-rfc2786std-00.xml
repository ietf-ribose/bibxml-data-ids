      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it defines a textual convention for doing Diffie- Hellman key agreement key exchanges and a set of objects which extend the usmUserTable to permit the use of a DH key exchange in addition to the key change method described in [14]. In other words, this MIB adds the possibility of forward secrecy to the USM model. It also defines a set of objects that can be used to kick start security on an SNMPv3 agent when the out of band path is authenticated, but not necessarily private or confidential. The author is submitting this draft at the request of the O&amp;M area director. This memo revises and updates RFC 2786 [19] with the goal of moving the described protocol and MIB from Experimental to Standards Track. The one minor substantive change from the Experimental RFC is a restatement of the conditions on the selection of the DH public number (see DHKeyChange and usmDHKickstartMyPublic in the body of the MIB as well as the MIBs revision history). The spelling of 'Hellman' was corrected throughout. Author contact information was updated. Slight structural modifications were made to more cleanly seperate boilerplate from substantive text.</t>
