      <t>In the March of 2006 the IAB held a workshop on the topic of"Unwanted Internet Traffic". The report from that workshop isdocumented in RFC 4948 [RFC4948]. Section 8.2 of RFC 4948 calls for"[t]ightening the security of the core routing infrastructure." Fourmain steps were identified for improving the security of the routinginfrastructure. One of those steps was "securing the routingprotocols' packets on the wire," also called the routing protocoltransport. One mechanism for securing routing protocol transports isthe use of per-packet cryptographic message authentication, providingboth peer authentication and message integrity. Many differentrouting protocols exist and they employ a range of differenttransport subsystems. Therefore there must necessarily be variousmethods defined for applying cryptographic authentication to thesevarying protocols. Many routing protocols already have some methodfor accomplishing cryptographic message authentication. However, inmany cases the existing methods are dated, vulnerable to attack,and/or employ cryptographic algorithms that have been deprecated.The "Keying and Authentication for Routing Protocols" (KARP) effortaims to overhaul and improve these mechanisms. This document has twomain parts. The first describes the threat analysis for attacksagainst routing protocols' transports. The second enumerates therequirements for addressing the described threats. This document,along with the KARP Design Guide and KARP Framework documents, willbe used by KARP design teams for specific protocol review andoverhaul. This document reflects the input of both the IETF'sSecurity Area and Routing Area in order to form a jointly agreed uponguidance.</t>
