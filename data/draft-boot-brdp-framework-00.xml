      <t>This document describes the Border Router Discovery Protocol (BRDP)framework. This framework enables multi-homing for small to mediumsites, using Provider Aggregatable IPv6 addresses. It describes amechanism for automated IP address configuration and renumbering, amechanism for optimized source address selection and a new paradigmfor packet forwarding. The BRDP framework prevents ingress filteringproblems with multi-homed sites and supports load-balancing formulti-path transport protocols. This work also prevents routingscalability problems in the provider network and Internet DefaultFree Zone because small to medium multi-homed size sites would notneed to request Provider Independent address blocks.</t>
