      <t>The MPLS transport profile (MPLS-TP) is being standardized to enable carrier-grade packet transport. This document provides texts proposal which should be discussed and included in draft-fbb-mpls-tp-p2mp-framework, particularly focusing on p2mp OAM framework in case that return paths don't exist. Other requirements of p2mp transport path such as protection will also be discussed. Note: This I-D was made based on the result of discussion in ITU-T SG15 which is described in a Liaison Statement: Request advance work on the p2mp framework in MPLS-TP (https://datatracker.ietf.org/liaison/1163/) This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) / International Telecommunications Union Telecommunications Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.</t>
