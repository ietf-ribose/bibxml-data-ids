      <t>The migration feature of NFSv4 provides for moving responsibility for a single filesystem from one server to another, without disruption to clients. Implementation experience has shown problems in specification for this feature in RFC7530. This document explains the choices made to address these issues by updating the NFSv4.0 specification in RFC7931 and those to be made with regard to the NFSv4.1 specification, in order to properly address migration.</t>
