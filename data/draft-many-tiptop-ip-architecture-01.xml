    <abstract>
      <t>Deep space communications involve long delays (e.g., Earth to Mars is 4-24 minutes) and intermittent communications, because of orbital dynamics. The IP protocol stack used on Earth's Internet is based on assumptions of shorter delays and mostly uninterrupted communications. This document describes the architecture of the IP protocol stack tailored for its use in deep space. It involves buffering IP packets in IP forwarders facing intermittent links and adjusting transport protocol configuration and application protocol timers. This architecture applies to the Moon, Mars, or general interplanetary networking.</t>
