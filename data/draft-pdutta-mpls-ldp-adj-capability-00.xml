      <t>This document defines method for negotiation of a set of capabilities specific to a Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) Hello Adjacency. The document uses the TLVs for the LDP Capabilities defined in [RFC5561] to be used for exchanging capabilities over LDP Hello Adjacencies. The Hello Adjacency capabilities can be thought of as "Traffic Forwarding Capabilities" (TFC). Some capabilties already exist that can be re-used for hello adjacency specific capabilities and it is likely that some may be defined in future. This document defines the mechanism to advertise LDP TFCs for a hello adjacency as well as mechanism to enable and disable TFCs after a hello adjacency is formed between LDP peers.</t>
