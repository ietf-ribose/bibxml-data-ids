      <t>The Proxy Mobile IPv6 allows a mobile node's IPv4 and IPv6 trafficbetween a Local Mobility Anchor(LMA) and a Mobile Access Gateway(MAG) to be tunneled using IPv6, IPv4 or IPv4-UDP encapsulationheaders. In this document, Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)tunneling is proposed as an alternative tunnel technology which isused between a MAG and a LMA. MPLS is now become more and morepopular, and MPLS support is an important function for edge and corerouters. Integrating MPLS and Proxy IP Mobility can leverage ProxyIP Mobility deployment in the industry.</t>
