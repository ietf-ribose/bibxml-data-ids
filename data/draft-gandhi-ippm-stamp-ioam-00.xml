      <t>Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) defined in RFC 8762 and its optional extensions defined in RFC 8972 can be used for Edge-To-Edge (E2E) active measurement. In Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) data fields defined in RFC 9197 and RFC 9326 can be used for recording and collecting Hop-By-Hop (HBH) and E2E operational and telemetry information. This document extends STAMP to carry IOAM data fields for HBH and E2E two-way active measurement and telemetry. The STAMP extensions are generic and allow to carry and reflect any type of IPv6 option and MPLS Network Action Sub-Stacks for two-way active measurement.</t>
