      <t>Load balancing in structured (DHT-based) Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems has been thoroughly studied during the past years. This draft provides a review of the existing and proposed load balancing mechanisms for structured P2P systems, categorizes them to four fundamental load balancing models, and introduces their main characteristics.</t>
