      <t>This document provides environment security requirements for the I2RS architecture. Environment security requirements are independent of the protocol used for I2RS. The I2RS protocol security requirements set the security for the communication between I2RS client and agent while the security environment requirements are rather intended for deployment or implementations features independent of the I2RS protocol. The environmental security requirements described in this document provide the good security practices to be used with the I2RS protocol so that I2RS protocol implementations can be securely deployed and operated.</t>
