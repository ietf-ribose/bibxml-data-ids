      <t>This document specifies a method and its architecture for proxy application based on the PKI environment with X.509 certificate [X.509]. This kind of proxy service is applicable in the occasions that a proxy entity is authorized by the client to implement the tasks with the service provider. As a typical application, this method can be used on DRM service regardless the specific DRM standard which is implemented on the interface between the Client Device and Service Server. An DRM instance of the PKI proxy service is given in the appendix of this document and is fully addressed to support the proxy architecture defined in this document.</t>
