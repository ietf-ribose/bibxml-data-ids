      <t>This document describes a data format, the Lightweight Presence Information Data Format (LPIDF) for conveying presence information. The format is based on RFC822 encoding of presence data. In fact, this encoding is exactly identical to the encoding used by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in its registration messages. This simplifies the process of parsing and processing presence data in clients which use SIP for presence or communications services. LPIDF is one instantiation of an abstract presence data model also described here.</t>
