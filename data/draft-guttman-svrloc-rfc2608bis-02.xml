    <abstract>
      <t>The Service Location Protocol provides a scalable framework for the discovery and selection of network services. Using this protocol, computers using the Internet need little or no static configuration of network services for network based applications. This is especially important as computers become more portable, and users less tolerant or able to fulfill the demands of network system administration. This document updates SLPv2, adding clarifications and removing features which were neither widely implemented or deemed useful.</t>
