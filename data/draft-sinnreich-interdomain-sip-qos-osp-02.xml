      <t>Commercial grade IP telephony requires linkage between call setup,end-to-end QoS setup, interdomain authorization and accounting. Thisdraft considers the network model for inter-domain QoS for access andtransit networks, the service models and policy implementationoptions. Also, interdomain authorization and accounting may requirethe trust services of a clearinghouse, to which the local policyserver may outsource authorization for support for inter-domainaccounting.The draft defines two options for QoS support for telephony: PSTN-style 'QoS Assured' or Internet-style 'QoS Enabled' service.Implementing the local policy or QoS deployment can also have twooptions: The more usual policy 'Pull Model' and the policy 'PushModel' that may be advantageous for large IP telephony gatewaydeployments. The draft illustrates the various combinations of QoSservice and policy implementation for interdomain QoS withauthorization and accounting.The inter-process communications between the SIP, SDP, RSVP and OSPprotocol engines is illustrated. Future work for SIP/SDP and otherextensions, QoS metric and policy is outlined to make interdomain QoSfor IP telephony possible.</t>
