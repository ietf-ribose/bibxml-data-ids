      <t>A mechanism is needed to permit web clients to locate nearby(caching) web proxy. Current best practice is for end users to handconfigure their web client (i.e., browser) with the URL of an 'autoconfiguration file'. In large environments this presents aformidable support problem. It would be much more manageable forthe web client software to automatically learn the configurationinformation for its web proxy settings. This is typically referredto as a resource discovery problem.</t>
