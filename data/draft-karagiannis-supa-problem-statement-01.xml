    <abstract>
      <t>As modern network management applications grow in scale and complexity, their demands and requirements on the supporting communication network increase. In particular, network operators are challenged to create a simplified view of their network infrastructure and help service developers on using and programming this simplified view rather than manipulating individual devices. In this context, providing service developers with a set of standard interfaces to configure and set policies on the network is essential. This document describes what has to be addressed in order to equip service providers with a vendor neutral standardized application- based interfaces used to expose and define policies and n abstract view of network infrastructure.</t>
