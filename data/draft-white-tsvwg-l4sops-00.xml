      <t>This is an early, work-in-progress draft - a start at getting some of the ideas from the mailing list and email exchanges on paper. This draft is intended to provide guidance to operators of end- systems, operators of networks, and researchers in order to ensure reasonable fairness between L4S and Classic flows sharing a single- queue RFC3168 bottleneck link. This draft identifies opportunites to prevent and/or detect and resolve fairness problems in such networks.</t>
