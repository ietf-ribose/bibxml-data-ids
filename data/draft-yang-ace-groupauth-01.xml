      <t>Constrained devices have a limitation in adapting various general cryptography mechanisms since they have limited processing power, storage space and transmission capacities. Moreover, in an environment that has a large number of constrained devices, the device authentication and authorization procedure causes serious burdens. Therefore, this draft proposes a group authentication mechanism to solve existing problems.</t>
