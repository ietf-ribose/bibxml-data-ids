      <t>The proposed [I-D.kucherawy-sender-auth-header] defines a headerfield used to capture email verification results obtained at borderreceptions has been approved for publication. However, seriousdeficiencies remain in its secure use and has prompted an appeal ofthe publication decision. This new header field is to convey to MailUser Agents (MUA) and downstream processes the verification resultsthat are intended to augment handling decisions and messageannotations that might be made visible to recipients. For such use,it is crucial to include within an "authenticated-results" header, atruly authenticated identity.The draft acknowledges that it confuses authorization withauthentication in section 1.5.2. This confusion has lead the draftto incorrectly elevate the authorization of an SMTP client into theauthentication of an email-address domain. Elevating the*authorization* of the SMTP client into the *authentication* of anemail-address domain incorrectly assumes current email practicesadequately restrict the use of an email-address domain based upon theoriginating IP address of the SMTP client. In an era of carriergrade NATs, virtual servers, aggregated services, and othertechniques that overload the IP address, this assumption is neithersafe nor practical.Although the draft explicitly declares Sender-ID and SPF as theauthorization of the transmitting SMTP client, it fails to offer theauthenticated identity being trusted. A truly authenticated identityis essential for reputation assessments which section 4.1 indicatesshould be made prior to results being revealed. A reputation checkof a truly authenticated identifier is often a necessary step neededto mitigate fraud and abuse. In addition, it is unfair to attributefraud or abuse to the unauthenticated identifiers. Even so, theheader offers no assurance that any reputation check has been made,nor does it ensure that an authenticated identity, the IP address ofthe SMTP client, can be determined by the MUA or downstream process.The goal of the appeal is to ensure adequate information is availablewhen annotating email.</t>
