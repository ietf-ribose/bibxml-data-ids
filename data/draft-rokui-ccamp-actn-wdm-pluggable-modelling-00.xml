    <abstract>
      <t>This draft outlines the modeling of optical pluggables within a host packet device in the context of a packet over optical network. The model encompasses all pertinent properties of the pluggable for various packet over optical use cases and is partitioned into three primary areas: the optical media interface, the electrical plug to host interconnect, and the physical equipment of the pluggable. Included in the model are representations of configuration, states, and telemetry data, as well as of profiles and coherent plug capabilities. Emphasizing the importance of considering both vendor- agnostic and vendor-specific attributes in modeling coherent pluggables. Drawing from existing models in IETF, OpenConfig, ITU-T, OIF, and TAPI, this model offers enhanced uniform structuring and naming. Additionally, it provides insight into the mapping to plug interface structures defined in CMIS. This draft introduces the concpet of "Coherent Pluggable Manifest", where a represents the capabilities of a type&amp;version of pluggable, maintained in a public repository of all pluggables. This document also covers gap analysis of current IETF drafts and other SDOs on coherent pluggables attributes and provides the complete lifecycle of a coherent pluggable from operators' approval through viability assessment to deployment.</t>
