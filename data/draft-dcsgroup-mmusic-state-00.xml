      <t>This document describes extensions to the Session InitiationProtocol RFC(2543) for supporting telephony services using theDistributed Call Signaling architecture described in [2]. Thisdocument discusses extensions to the host parameter in the SIP URLfor supporting the following: (a) a call signaling architecturewhere call state is distributed to the clients during call setup andstored there for the duration of the call, (b) support for localnumber portability and (c) relaxation of the strong coupling betweenthe phone number and its gateway in the telephony subscriber URL asdefined in RFC 2543. Additional headers in SIP messages for passingcall state information between the clients and their proxies, andsupport for PSTN-based operator services are also discussed in thisdocument. In addition, the need for the Also and Replaces headerspreviously discussed in [3]) are mentioned here.</t>
