      <t>Domains can authenticate their outgoing mail using DKIM or othertechniques. In some cases where miscreants frequently use a domainwithout authorization in the Author address in e-mail messages, itmay be prudent for recipient mail systems to discard unauthenticatedmail as likely to be fraudulent. This specification defines anextension to Vouch by Reference (VBR) that allows a certifier toidentify such domains, and that recipients can use either inconjunction with or independently of VBR.</t>
