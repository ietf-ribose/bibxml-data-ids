      <t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides a framework for performing authentication and key management using the AAA infrastructure. The framework deals with a model which includes a peer, a pass-through authenticator and a backend authentication server. Some of the emerging mobile networks use EAP in handover scenarios in ways that go beyond currently defined EAP keying framework. This document provides a problem statement for the usage of EAP in these emerging mobile networks.</t>
