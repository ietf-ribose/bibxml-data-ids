      <t>If Internet Telephony is to offer a full replacement for traditionaltelephone services, it needs to provide emergency call services. Inthe United States, emergency calls are known as 911 services, basedon the number dialed. This note desccribes some options for providingenhanced emergency service, i.e., emergency calls that allowemergency response centers to determine the address where the calleris located. This is made more difficult by the temporary nature of IPaddresses, the large number of ISPs and their lack of legalresponsibility for emergency services and the ability of manyInternet terminals to be connected to the Internet at differentlocations. This note explores some of the requirements and designchoices.</t>
