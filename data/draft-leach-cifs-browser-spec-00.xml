      <t>The CIFS/E (CIFS extensions for enterprise networks) family of protocols includes a protocol for browsing. Browsing is a mechanism for discovering servers that are running particular services (not just CIFS file services). Servers are organized into named groups called domains, which form browsing scopes. This document specifies version 1.15 of the browsing protocol. It also specifies the mailslot protocol, because the browsing protocol depends on it (and is the only CIFS/E protocol which does).</t>
