      <t>This memo presents IP extension for recovering multicast packets fromcongestion. Dropped packets can be recovered far faster by IP routerswith extension of this memo than by group member end-hosts. Becausenecessary interactions are limited among adjacent routers, this schemesubstantially reduces overall signaling overhead among group membersfor packet recovery.</t>
