      <t>This memo presents IP extension for recovering multicast packets from congestion. Dropped packets can be recovered far faster by IP routers with extension of this memo than by group member end-hosts. Because necessary interactions are limited among adjacent routers, this scheme substantially reduces overall signaling overhead among group members for packet recovery.</t>
