    <abstract>
      <t>COSE (STD 96, RFC 9052 and RFC 9338) defines a number of registries that allow registrants to exercise the numerous extension points defined in COSE. Section 11.6 of RFC 9052 gives the Designated Experts for these registries considerable leeway in deciding about registration requests. The present document is intended to collect information that has been the basis for initial population of and further registration in these registries. It is intended to be shaped by the Designated Experts and serve them as a collective memorandum and a checklist. As a secondary function, it is also intended to help registrants create registrations that are acceptable to the Designated Experts. // Revision -00 of this draft is an early skeleton that should allow // us to decide whether such a collection of information is useful // and whether we want to flesh out this document.</t>
