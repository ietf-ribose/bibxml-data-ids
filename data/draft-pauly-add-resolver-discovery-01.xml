      <t>This document defines a method for dynamically discovering resolvers that support encrypted transports, and introduces the concept of designating a resolver to be used for a subset of client queries based on domain. This method is intended to work both for locally- hosted resolvers and resolvers accessible over the broader Internet.</t>
