    <abstract>
      <t>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) can operate in several modes. Some of these modes are based on the receipt of unsolicited packets and therefore require the use of a well-known port as the local port. However, in the case of NTP modes where the use of a well-known port is not required, employing such a well-known port unnecessarily facilitates the ability of attackers to perform blind/off-path attacks. This document formally updates RFC 5905, recommending the use of transport-protocol ephemeral port randomization for those modes where use of the NTP well-known port is not required.</t>
