      <t>Mobile IPv6 and Dual-stack Mobile IPv6 protocols require the signaling messages between the mobile node and home agent to be secured. However security for the user plane/traffic is optional and is a choice left to the mobile node. This document proposes extensions to Mobile IPv6 signaling which enables the user plane traffic to be secured on a need or on-demand basis. The mobile node or the home agent can request at any time security for the user plane traffic. Security for user plane traffic can be triggered as a result of policy or, mobility or, at the user's choice.</t>
