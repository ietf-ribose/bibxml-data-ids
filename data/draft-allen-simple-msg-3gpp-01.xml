      <t>The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) is using SIP RFC 3261 [1] as the session establishment protocol for the 3GPP IP Multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IM CN Subsystem, IMS). 3GPP has recently started working on messaging over the IM CN Subsystem. It is intended that this will utilize the IM CN Subsystem for delivery and may be based on IETF protocols including the work being performed in the SIMPLE working group. In this document is provided an outline and areas of interest of the 3GPP work on IMS messaging for the information of the SIMPLE working group.</t>
