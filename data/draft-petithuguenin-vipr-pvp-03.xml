      <t>One of the main challenges in inter-domain federation of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) calls is that many domains continue to utilize phone numbers, and not email-style SIP URI. Consequently, a mechanism is needed that enables secure mappings from phone numbers to domains. The main technical challenge in doing this securely is to verify that the domain in question truly is the "owner" of the phone number. This specification defines the PSTN Validation Protocol (PVP), which can be used by a domain to verify this ownership by means of a forward routability check in the PSTN.</t>
