      <t>In order for DNSSEC to be deployed operationally, there needs to be a mechanism that allows for unsigned RRsets in a secure zone. In the current definition of DNSSEC [RFC 2535], it is allowed to have 2 types of unsigned records, i.e. glue address RRsets and delegation point NS RRsets. There exists several reasons to allow other unsigned RRsets, all related to the scalability and maintenance of a secure zone.</t>
