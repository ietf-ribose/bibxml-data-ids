      <t>Consider a BGP free core scenario where traffic is tunneled betweenedge routers. Suppose the edge BGP speakers PE1, PE2,..., PEn knowabout a prefix P/m via the external routers CE1, CE2,..., CEm. Ifthe edge router PEi crashes or becomes totally disconnected from thecore, it desirable for a core router "P" that is carrying traffic tothe failed edge router PEi to immediately restore traffic by re-routing packets originally tunneled to PEi and destined to the prefixP/m to one of the other edge routers that advertised P/m, say PEj,until BGP re-converges. If the packets originally flowing to thefailed edge router PEi are labeled, then the repairing core router Prouter may need to swap, push, or pop the label advertised by thefailed edge router PEi with another label before re-routing thepacket through an LSP terminating PEj so that PEj can correctlyforward the packet. The document proposes an extension to IS-ISprotocol to inform core routers about the repair edge router PEj and,for labeled packets, the label that needs to be pushed/swapped beforesending the packet into the tunnel terminating on PEj</t>
