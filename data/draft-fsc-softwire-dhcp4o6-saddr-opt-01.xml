      <t>DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341] describes a mechanism for dynamically configuring IPv4 over an IPv6-only network. For DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 to function with some IPv4-over-IPv6 softwire mechanisms, the operator must obtain information about the IPv4 address and Port Set ID allocated to the DHCP 4o6 client, as well as the /128 IPv6 prefix that the client will use as the source of IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel. This memo defines a DHCPv6 container option and two DHCPv6 sub-options used to communicate the source tunnel IPv6 address between the DHCP 4o6 client and server. It is designed to work in conjunction with the IPv4 address allocation process.</t>
