      <t>With the proliferation of IP based internetworking services to massbusiness and consumer markets carriers are faced with operationalchallenges in an extent never before experienced in previous LAN MANor WAN environments. To accommodate these new internetworking envi-ronments, carrier workflow management applications for service Ful-fillment, Assurance, and Billing (FAB) need to undergo major a tran-sition. In essence applications need to transition from being pertechnology centric to being service centric, as historic correspon-dence between technology and service is no longer true. Applicationsdo not need to change in nature, since they still need to supportinventory, CRM, order and other workflows. However, applicationsneed to include a service centric aspect as basis for these work-flows.Service Centric solutions can be shared by a wide range of managementand workflow applications, rather than be re-invented by each one.Service Centric Management solutions must be distributed in order tocope with the massive scale and complexity challenges of the underly-ing networks. Service Centric Management Protocol (SCMP) and distri-bution should be standardized to facilitate multi-vendor interoper-ability in this emerging space, allow for potential future embeddingwithin NE, and to allow for Service Centric Management primitives toextend across Inter Carrier Interfaces (ICI) and inner carrier regu-latory bounds.</t>
