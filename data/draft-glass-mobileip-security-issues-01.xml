      <t>Mobile IP is designed to provide IP services to roaming nodes, allowing them access to services, and enabling other nodes to reach them, as if they were on their home domain. By definition this functionality must be deployed on multiple subnets, and in many cases across domains, and while services which enable Mobile IPMUST be present on a subnet in order for a mobile node to have thisreachability, deploying Mobile IP can introduce some securityissues which may need to be addressed, by any network administratoroverseeing Mobile IP subnets.</t>
