    <abstract>
      <t>Stateful Hash-Based Signature Schemes (S-HBS) such as LMS, HSS, XMSS and XMSS^MT combine Merkle trees with One-Time Signatures (OTS) to provide signatures that are resistant against attacks using large- scale quantum computers. Unlike conventional stateless digital signature schemes, S-HBS have a state to keep track of which OTS keys have been used, as double-signing with the same OTS key allows forgeries. This document provides guidance and documents security considerations for the operational and technical aspects of deploying systems that rely on S-HBS. Management of the state of the S-HBS, including any handling of redundant key material, is a sensitive topic, and we discuss some approaches to handle the associated challenges. We also describe the challenges that need to be resolved before certain approaches should be considered.</t>
