      <t>When multiple congestion controlled RTP sessions traverse the same network bottleneck, combining their controls can improve the total on-the-wire behavior in terms of delay, loss and fairness. This document describes such a method for flows that have the same sender, in a way that is as flexible and simple as possible while minimizing the amount of changes needed to existing RTP applications. It specifies how to apply the method for the NADA congestion control algorithm, and provides suggestions on how to apply it to other congestion control algorithms.</t>
