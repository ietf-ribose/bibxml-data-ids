    <abstract>
      <t>JMAP (RFC8620) is a generic, efficient, mobile friendly and scalable protocol that can be used for data of any type. This makes it a good fit for migrations or data portability use cases that are focusing on data import and export. However, due to its large set of features, it is also quite complex, which makes it difficult to explore new application domains in practice. The goal of this document is to provide guidelines on implementing essential parts of JMAP for a much lower entry barrier and more efficient implementation of the protocol.</t>
