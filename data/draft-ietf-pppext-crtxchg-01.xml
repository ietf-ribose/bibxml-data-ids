      <t>The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point links PPP also defines an extensible Link Control Protocol, which allows negotiation of an Authentication Protocol for authentication of its peer before allowing Network Layer protocols to transmit over the link. The Certificate exchange protocol is an extension to PPP that is in the form of an additional phase, called the certificate exchange phase, that would allow for a PPP entity to request certificates from a peer. If configured, this phase would be negotiated during the LCP exchange. This exchange of certificates is aimed at easing configuration issues by providing for the exchange of certificate path information in a standard manner across different strong, or public-key certificate-based, authentication protocols. The certificate exchange protocol accomodates arbitrary sized certificates.</t>
