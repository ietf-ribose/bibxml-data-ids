      <t>In Information-centric network (ICN), everything is an identifiable object with a name such as named data chunks, services and mobile devices. Different from host-centric connectivity, ICN connects these named entities using name-based routing and forwarding. At the same time, network entities, end devices, and applications have variant demands to verify the integrity, authenticity, and validation of these entities through names. This document proposes a generic naming schema, called PID (Principal, Identifier, and Domain), which supports security provenance, content lookup, routing and inter- domain resolution for ICN. With P:I:D (or simply PID) schema, a name consists of three components: Principal, Identifier, and Domain. In this specification, we only illustrate the principles and concepts of PID schema and the functional role of each component, and leave the encoding approaches as implementation options.</t>
