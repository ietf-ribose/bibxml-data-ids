      <t>This document describes the functional requirements for a protocol used by a call processing agent in a packet network to control an interactive voice response function located in the same packet net- work or at the interface of the packet network and the traditional telephone network. These requirements focus primary on audio, however the protocol could be extended in the future to support other media streams such as video.</t>
