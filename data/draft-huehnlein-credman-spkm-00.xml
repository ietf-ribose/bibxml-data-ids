      <t>The GSS-API [GSS-API1,2] offers security services independent of underlying mechanisms. A possible GSS-mechanism is the Simple Public Key Mechanism [SPKM]. This paper complements [SPKM] by providing concrete rules for the Credential Management. Our proposal allows beside the standard Credential Management based on X.509v3 [X509v3] and PKIX [PKIX] the self certification of temporary public keys, which may be used to implement a Secure Single Login variant, which works with temporary keys instead of the sensitive long term keys. The benefits of this approach are discussed in [SSLogin] more detailed. Since DL-based signature- and encryption algorithms are very well suited for the efficient generation of the temporary keys we propose two new RECOMMENDED algorithms for SPKM.</t>
