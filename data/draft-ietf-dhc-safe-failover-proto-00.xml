      <t>The DHCP protocol [RFC 2131] [1] allows multiple DHCP servers. A recent draft, the DHCP Failover Protocol [3], has been distributed which is designed to provide a redundant DHCP solution. While clearly a work in progress, it is equally clear that it can be made to work and meet the goals that the authors have set for it. One of the goals of the Failover protocol is that it should avoid duplicate IP address allocations, except under some rare circumstances. While this approach may be quite reasonable in a wide variety of environ- ments, some environments require a DHCP redundancy solution which can (optionally) ensure that no possibility of duplicate IP address allo- cation exists. The Safe Failover protocol is designed to build on top of the Failover protocol, and add to it certain protocol exchanges, prac- tices and algorithms which will create a DHCP redundancy solution which avoids duplicate IP address allocation.</t>
