      <t>There are occasions where it is advantageous to put authenticity and privacy features at the network layer. The vast majority of the privacy and authentication protocols in the literature deal with session oriented key-management schemes. However, many of the commonly used network layer protocols (for example, IPv4 and IPv6) are session-less datagram oriented protocols. We describe a key-management scheme that is particularly well suited for use in conjunction with a session-less datagram protocol like IPv4 or IPv6. SKIP has been designed to work with the IP Security Protocols AH and ESP [8, 9, 10] which are specified for both IPv4 and IPv6.</t>
