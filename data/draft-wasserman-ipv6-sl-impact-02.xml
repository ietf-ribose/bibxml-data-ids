      <t>Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) introduces a scoped unicastaddressing architecture, including the concept of site-localaddressing. Although site-local addresses were originally definedfor use in networks that were not yet connected to the Internet,there has been work underway for several years to expand the use ofsite-local addresses to globally connected IPv6 networks and nodes.The use of site-local addresses on globally connected networks andnodes raises complex technical issues for many parts of the TCP/IPprotocol suite. Many of these issues are caused by the fact thatIPv6 sites are private address spaces, and site-local addresses areunreachable or ambiguous outside the borders of their originatingsite. Site-local addresses also add significant complexity at theIP layer and at other layers of the protocol stack. In addition,many of the benefits of site-local addressing can be achieved usingmechanisms that are significantly less complex and that cause fewerproblems than IPv6 site-local addressing.This document makes a recommendation to limit the use of site-localaddresses to isolated, single-site networks, and offers suggestionsfor less complicated mechanisms to achieve many of the benefitscurrently attributed to IPv6 site-local addressing.</t>
