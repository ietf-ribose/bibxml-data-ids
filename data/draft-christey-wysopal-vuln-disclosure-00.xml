      <t>New vulnerabilities in software and hardware products are discovered and publicized on a daily basis. The disclosure of vulnerability information has been a divisive topic for years. During the process of disclosure, many vendors, security researchers, and other parties follow a variety of unwritten or informal guidelines for how they interact and share information. Some parties may be unaware of these guidelines, or they may intentionally ignore them. This state of affairs can make it difficult to achieve a satisfactory outcome for everyone who uses or is affected by vulnerability information.</t>
