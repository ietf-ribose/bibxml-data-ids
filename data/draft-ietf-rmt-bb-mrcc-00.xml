      <t>This document describes MRCC, a scalable multirate congestion control building block for multicast. MRCC is an approach that allows multiple receivers to concurrently receive packets from a single sender at vary- ing rates depending on individual bandwidth connections and network con- ditions. Two basic goals of the approach are to allow each receiver to obtain the full benefit of the available bandwidth to the sender and to be fair to other flows in the network.</t>
