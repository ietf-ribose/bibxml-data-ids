      <t>This document describes MRCC, a scalable multirate congestion controlbuilding block for multicast. MRCC is an approach that allows multiplereceivers to concurrently receive packets from a single sender at vary-ing rates depending on individual bandwidth connections and network con-ditions. Two basic goals of the approach are to allow each receiver toobtain the full benefit of the available bandwidth to the sender and tobe fair to other flows in the network.</t>
