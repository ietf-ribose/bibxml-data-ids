      <t>Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is an authorization strategy in which an entity's permission to access and manipulate targeted resources is determined by the entity's role or function within a certain organizational context. RBAC's principal motivation is to streamline security policy administration. Many discrete authoriza- tions can be aggregated within a defined role. One or many roles may be assigned or attributed to individuals. This draft describes LDAP object classes and attributes which support RBAC. Adoption of this schema across multiple LDAP implementations will enable RBAC intero- perability among heterogeneous underlying directory services.</t>
