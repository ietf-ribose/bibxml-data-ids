    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes policy-based accounting which is an approachto provide flexibility to accounting architectures. Accountingpolicies describe the configuration of an accounting architecture ina standardized way. They are used to instrument the accountingarchitecture and can be exchanged between AAA entities in order toshare configuration information.This document describes building blocks and message sequences forpolicy-based accounting in the generic AAA architecture [RFC2903].Examples are given for the usage of accounting policies in differentscenarios. Furthermore it is shown how accounting components can beintegrated into the AAA authorization framework [RFC2904]. Thisdocument does not propose a language for the description ofaccounting policies. It is rather assumed that a suitable policylanguage can be chosen from existing or upcoming standards.</t>
