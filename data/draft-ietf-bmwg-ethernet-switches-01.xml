      <t>This initial draft sets out to define a methodology designed specifically for Ethernet switches. Although the roots of these devices are clearly to be found in bridging, switches have matured enough in the last few years to deserve some special attention. The test methodology described here concentrates on four areas: throughput, address handling, latency and behavior in abnormal conditions. This draft will attempt to make clear why switch specific tests are needed in each of these four areas and will define a number of tests in each area. In addition to defining the tests this document also describes specific formats for reporting the results of the tests. Appendix A lists the tests and conditions that we believe should be included for specific cases and gives additional information about testing practices. Appendix B is a reference listing of maximum frame rates to be used with specific frame sizes on Ethernet.</t>
