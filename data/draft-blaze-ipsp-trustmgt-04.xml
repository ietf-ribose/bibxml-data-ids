      <t>This draft describes an architecture for security policy management for IPSEC based on the principle of ``compliance checking.'' We describe a two-level policy hierarchy, in which security association policy is managed by a highly flexible policy language, which in turn provides input to packet policies that are managed by a fast packet filtering language. We provide a sample SA policy language, based on KeyNote, and describe interoperability issues for this architecture.</t>
