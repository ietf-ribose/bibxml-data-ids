      <t>This document defines an SNMP Usage for REsource LOcation And Discovery(RELOAD). The objective of SNMP Usage is to provide the functionality of managing the RELOAD network. In particular, the SNMP Usage provides the following functions: (a) defining the method that allow the registrations to map a network manager's name to a host node reachable in the overlay, and (b) providing lookup service for the node hosts the network manager in the overlay. Then the AppAttach method is used to exchange addresses between nodes to establish a direct connection through which SNMP messages are exchanged.</t>
