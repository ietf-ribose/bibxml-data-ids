      <t>This document takes a look at various aspects of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) used in embedded sensors and controller applications such as IP Smart Objects and IP based Wireless Sensor Networks. These devices may be interconnected via many different types of media, including 802.15.4 (lowpans), power line control (PLC), RS485, but the common characteristic is that the devices have extremely limited code space and memory space for both the stack and application. Just as there is no one single API for IP networking stacks today (though the "Berkeley sockets" might be considered de- facto standard) there is not likely to be a single standard in the embedded space, but there can be some common understanding about facilities that can and should be provided to the application developer.</t>
