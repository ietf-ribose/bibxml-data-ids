      <t>Naive Distance Vector-based routing protocols like the Routing Information Protocol [RFC_1058] suffer from a phenomena called the "count to infinity problem" in the event of a network topology change. This Internet Draft extends a naive Distance Vector routing implementation with a simple flag that allows the network to recover quickly and reliably, with no chance of routing loops to occur.
