      <t>The Internet exhibits certain specific types of behavior (e.g.,bursty packet loss) that can affect the performance seen by the usersas well as the operators. The loss pattern or loss distribution is akey parameter that determines the performance observed by the usersfor certain real-time applications such as packet voice and video.For the same loss rate, two different loss distributions couldpotentially produce widely different perceptions of performance.Using the base loss metric defined in RFC 2680, this document defines two derived metrics 'loss distance' and 'loss period', and the associated statistics that together capture loss patterns experiencedby packet streams on the Internet.</t>
