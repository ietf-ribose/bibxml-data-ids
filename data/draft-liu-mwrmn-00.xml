      <t>This paper describes a cooperative communication method of theconverged multi-media wireless resource management network.It can maximize the utilization of heterogeneous network resources and optimize the access to wireless resources of the network in the form of Mesh, which solves the problem of collaborative wireless resource management in multi-media converged networks. Through the overall consideration of multi-media converged networks including wired network, wireless network, broadband network, and narrowband network, joint access control and resource scheduling for network devices with different characteristics in heterogeneous networks are realized.</t>
