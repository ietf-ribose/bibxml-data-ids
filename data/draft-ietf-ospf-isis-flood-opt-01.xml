      <t>The flooding algorithm is one of the most important parts of any link state routing protocol. It ensures that all routers within a link state domain converge on the same topological information within a finite period of time. To ensure reliability, typical implementations of the flooding algorithm send new information via all interfaces other than the one the new piece of information was received on. This redundancy is necessary to guarantee that flooding is performed reliably, but implies considerable overhead of utilized bandwidth and CPU time if neighboring routers are connected with more than one link. This document describes a method that reduces this overhead.</t>
