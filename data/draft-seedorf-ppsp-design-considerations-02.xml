      <t>Streaming video on P2P overlays puts extremely high demands andstress on the underlying network, especially in case of TV and livestreaming. The EU research project NAPA-WINE has devised an overallarchitecture for live video streaming that supports the needs of theusers and content providers, while being respective of network-levelneeds, as reducing inter-AS traffic using ALTO-like services.
