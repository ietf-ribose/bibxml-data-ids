      <t>This document reports on experience and simulations of dynamic probing of alternate paths between two IPv6 hosts when network failures occur. Two models for such probing were investigated: the SHIM6 REAchability Protocol (REAP) and the Multipath Transmission Control Protocol (MPTCP). The motivation for this document is to identify some aspects of path probing at large or very large scale that may be broadly relevant to future protocol design.</t>
