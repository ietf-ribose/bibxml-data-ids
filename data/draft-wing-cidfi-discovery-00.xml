    <abstract>
      <t>Host-to-network signaling and network-to-host signaling can improve the user experience to adapt to network's constraints and share expected application needs, and thus to provide differentiated service to a flow and to packets within a flow. The differentiated service may be provided at the network (e.g., packet prioritization), the server (e.g., adaptive transmission), or both. Such an approach is called CIDFI, for Collaborative and Interoperable Dissemination of Flow Indicators. A key component in a CIDFI system is to discover whether a network is CIDFI-capable, and if so discover a set of CIDFI-aware Network Elements (CNEs) that will be involved in the Host-to-network signaling and network-to-host signaling. This document discusses a set of discovery methods.</t>
