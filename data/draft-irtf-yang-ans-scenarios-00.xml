      <t>This document examines some common wireless ad hoc network usage scenarios that have the potential of being deployed as medium or large scale networks. The scenarios include both pure ad hoc networks without any infrastructure support and the hybrid networks with some infrastructure in place. This document is motivated by the effort in the IRTF ANS (Ad hoc Network Scalability) research group. The aim of this document is to provide some common network scenarios that are rooted in the real world deployment to facilitate meaningful investigation and research of scalability in ad hoc networks.</t>
