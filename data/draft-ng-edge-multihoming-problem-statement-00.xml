      <t>This document analyzes multihoming from the perspective of the Internet edge: i.e. hosts and other edge networks. We built on top of the previous work that describes goals and benefits of multihoming, and identify problems for the provisioning of multihoming at the edge level. In this memo, we first look at the problem of multihoming for a generic IPv6 node, followed by narrowing the analysis down to mobile hosts and networks.</t>
