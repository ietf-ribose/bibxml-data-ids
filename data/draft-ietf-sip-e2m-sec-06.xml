    <abstract>
      <t>Some services provided by intermediaries depend on their ability to inspect a message body in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). When sensitive information is included in the message body, a SIP User Agent (UA) needs to protect it from other intermediaries than those that the UA agreed to disclose it to. This document proposes a mechanism for securing information passed between an end user and intermediaries using S/MIME. It also proposes mechanisms for a UA to discover intermediaries which need to inspect an S/MIME-secured message body, or to receive the message body with data integrity This specification is approved at the proposed standards level due to the IANA registration requirements. Is is of sufficient quality for that level, however, the use of this mechanism in this specification are considered experimental.</t>
