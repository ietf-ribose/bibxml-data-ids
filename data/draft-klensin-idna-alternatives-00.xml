      <t>The Internet protocol for internationalized domain names (IDNs) isdocumented in RFC 3490 and associated documents and commonly known asIDNA. While that protocol was being developed (and more recently),there were a number of alternate proposals and suggestions fordifferent ways to do IDNs. IDNA was favored over those alternatives,but variations on them seem to keep reappearing with the suggestionthat they are novel ideas. This memo describes some of thosesuggested alternatives and summarizes the reasons why they were notfavored over IDNA.</t>
