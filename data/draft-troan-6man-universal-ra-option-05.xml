      <t>One of the original intentions for the IPv6 host configuration, was to configure the network-layer parameters only with IPv6 ND, and use service discovery for other configuration information. Unfortunately that hasn't panned out quite as planned, and we are in a situation where all kinds of configuration options are added to RAs and DHCP. This document proposes a new universal option for RA and DHCP in a self-describing data format, with the list of elements maintained in an IANA registry, with greatly relaxed rules for registration.</t>
