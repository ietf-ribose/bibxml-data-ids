      <t>This document describes an architectural framework for deployinginterdomain multicast for IPv6 with simplicity, scalability,efficiency and security as the primary goals, applying the lessonslearned from deploying IPv4 multicast. In order to achieve thisobjective, the deprecation of network-based source discovery, andtherefore Any Source Multicast, is proposed. Source-SpecificMulticast is proposed as the service model supported for deployinginterdomain IPv6 multicast. The architectural components responsiblefor providing source discovery are also discussed.</t>
