      <t>TRILL supports multi-access TRILL links that can have multiple RBridges attached. This draft specifies RBridge Aggregation that enables concurrent data forwarding by multiple RBridges for the end stations in the same VLAN on a TRILL link without partition. RBridge Aggregation offers active/active multi-homing to multi-access TRILL links, which improves their reliability and increases the access bandwidth of RBridge campus.</t>
