    <abstract>
      <t>RFC 5019 defines a lightweight profile for OCSP that makes the protocol more suitable for use in high-volume environments. The lightweight profile specifies the mandatory use of SHA-1 when calculating the values of several fields in OCSP requests and responses. In recent years, weaknesses have been demonstrated with the SHA-1 algorithm. As a result, SHA-1 is increasingly falling out of use even for non-security relevant use cases. This document obsoletes the lightweight profile as specified in RFC 5019 to instead recommend the use of SHA-256 where SHA-1 was previously required. An RFC 5019-compliant OCSP client is still able to use SHA-1, but the use of SHA-1 may become obsolete in the future.</t>
