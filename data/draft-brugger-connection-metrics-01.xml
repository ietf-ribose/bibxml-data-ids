      <t>Numerous metrics, or features, have been used to describe TCPconnections. These features are frequently of interest to the networkintrusion detection community, and occasionally the networkengineering community. While researchers may understand these termswhen used by others, there are no formal definitions of these termssuch that two researchers looking at the same connection willnecessarily calculate the same values for all the metrics. This paperwill propose a potential set of connection metrics with formaldefinitions of each.</t>
