      <t>Numerous metrics, or features, have been used to describe TCP connections. These features are frequently of interest to the network intrusion detection community, and occasionally the network engineering community. While researchers may understand these terms when used by others, there are no formal definitions of these terms such that two researchers looking at the same connection will necessarily calculate the same values for all the metrics. This paper will propose a potential set of connection metrics with formal definitions of each.</t>
