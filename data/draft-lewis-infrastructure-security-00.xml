      <t>This RFC defines best current practices for implementing ServiceProvider network infrastructure protection for network elements.This RFC complements and extends RFC 2267 and RFC 3704. RFC 2267provides guidelines for filtering traffic on the ingress to serviceprovider networks. RFC 3704 expands the recommendations described inRFC 2267 to address operational filtering guidelines for single andmulti-homed environments. The focus of those RFCs is on filteringingress packets ingress, regardless of destination, if those packetsare have spoofed source address or fall within "reserved" addressspace. Deployment of RFCs 2267 and 3704 has limited the effects ofdenial of service attacks by dropping ingress packets with spoofedsource addresses, which in turn offers other benefits by ensuringthat packets coming into a network originate from validly allocatedand consistent sources.This document focuses solely on traffic destined to the networkinfrastructure itself to protect the network from denial of serviceand other attacks. This document presents techniques that, togetherwith network edge ingress filtering and RFC 2267 and RFC 3704, createa layered approach for infrastructure protection.This document does not present recommendations for protocol validation (i.e. "sanity checking") nor does it address guidelinesfor general security configuration.</t>
