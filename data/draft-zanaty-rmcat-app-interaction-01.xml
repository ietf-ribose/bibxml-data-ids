      <t>Interactive real-time media applications that use the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) must use congestion control techniques above the UDP layer since it provides none. This memo describes the interactions and conceptual interfaces necessary between the application components that relate to congestion control, including the RTP layer, the higher-level media codec control layer, and the lower-level transport interface, as well as components dedicated to congestion control functions.</t>
