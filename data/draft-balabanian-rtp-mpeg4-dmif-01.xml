      <t>This draft technical proposal describes how RTP carrying MPEG-4payloads interacts with the MPEG-4 Sync layer through the MPEG(Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework) DMIF. Single or multipleMPEG-4 streams can be carried over one RTP session. MPEG-4 informationessential for the efficient packing and unpacking of MPEG-4 streamsinto/from RTP is identified. The DMIF end-to-end signaling protocol is applied to identify the MPEG-4RTP payload types and ensure stack compatibility at both sender andreceiver locations. DMIF also interprets the RTCP reports by comparingits statistics to the requested MPEG-4 media based QoS. If thestatistics fail to meet the requested QoS then action is taken to eithercontinue with the impaired performance, upgrade the network serviceclass, scale down the stream or delete the stream. This action is apartfrom scalability using the stream back-channel flow control which maybe present between an encoder and its decoder. This is an update of the draft-ietf-avt-rtp-mpeg4-dmif-00. It reflectsthe latest MPEG-4 specs. In addition some clarifications are includedand an open issues section is established based on feedback received.</t>
