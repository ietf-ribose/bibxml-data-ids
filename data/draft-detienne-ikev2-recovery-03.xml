      <t>The Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) suffers from thelimitation of not having a means to quickly recover from a stalestate known as dangling Security Associations (SA's) where one sidehas SA's that the corresponding party does not have anymore.This Draft proposes to address the limitation by offering animmediate, DoS-free recovery mechanism for IKE that can be used inall failover or post-crash situations.</t>
