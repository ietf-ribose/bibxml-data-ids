      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) only supports session continuity for one basic scenario of vertical handoff -- the transfer of all prefixes assigned from one interface to another. However, there are some other advanced scenarios associated with vertical handoff that involves only transferring one (or some, but not all) of the prefixes that are allocated to an existing interface to a newly powered on interface. This draft outlines extensions to PMIPv6 protocol in order for a multiple interfaced mobile node to achieve such partial vertical handoff of selected prefix(es).</t>
