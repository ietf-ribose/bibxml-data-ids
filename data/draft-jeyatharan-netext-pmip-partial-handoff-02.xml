      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) only supports session continuity for onebasic scenario of vertical handoff -- the transfer of all prefixesassigned from one interface to another. However, there are someother advanced scenarios associated with vertical handoff thatinvolves only transferring one (or some, but not all) of the prefixesthat are allocated to an existing interface to a newly powered oninterface.
