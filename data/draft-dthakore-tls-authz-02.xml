      <t>This document specifies the use of DTCP certificate as an authorization extension in the Transport Layer Security Handshake Protocol, according to guidelines in RFC 5878. Extensions carried in the client and server Hello messages confirm that both parties support the desired authorization data types. Then if supported by both the client and server, DTCP certificates are exchanged in the supplemental data handshake TLS handshake message as specified in RFC4680.</t>
