      <t>The MITRE Corporation released a open source Instant Messaging system in March of 2000 called Simple Instant Messaging and Presence Service. This document describes an update to the protocol used by that system. In this version of the protocol, messages can be digitally signed. While the system does not meet many of the requirements of the IMPP working group, it is provided as background information on existing Instant Messaging implementations.</t>
