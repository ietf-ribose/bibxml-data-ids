      <t>Mobile IPv6 describes how a Mobile Node can change its point of attachment to the Internet. While MIPv6 focuses on unicast communications, it also proposes two basic mechanisms, known as bidirectionnal tunneling and remote subscription, to handle multicast communications with mobile members. In the mean time, the deployment of Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) is of great consideration, using the PIM-SM and MLDv2 protocols.</t>
