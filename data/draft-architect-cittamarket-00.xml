      <t>This document specifies the CITTAMARKET Protocol v1.0, an open standard for the immutable identification and timestamping of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems. The protocol leverages the Bitcoin blockchain's Proof-of-Work to solve the architectural problem of coordinating distributed autonomous systems without centralized control. It defines a four-layer architecture for creating unforgeable "Sovereign Identity" records. Priority of this invention is cryptographically anchored in Bitcoin blocks #927277, #927579, #928154, and #928185.</t>
