    <abstract>
      <t>vCon is a standardized framework for the exchange of conversational data. Conversations, which may involve one or more participants, occur across a wide variety of modes and application platforms. This document defines a JSON format for representing conversational data, encompassing metadata, conversation media, related documents, and analysis. The goal of this standard is to provide an abstracted, platform-independent data format for conversations, regardless of the mode or application platform. By doing so, it facilitates the integration and seamless exchange of conversational data across application platforms, enterprises, and trust boundaries.</t>
