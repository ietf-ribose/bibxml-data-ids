      <t>This memo specifies URI (Universal Resource Identifier) schemes used in Multimedia Messaging, as specified by the 3GPP. The 'mmsto' URI scheme is used to designate the MMS address of an individual or service. In its simplest form, an 'mmsto' URI contains either an E.164 phone number or an Internet mail address. For greater functionality, because interaction with some resources may require message headers or message bodies to be specified as well as the MMS address, the 'mmsto' URI scheme may optionally include MMS header fields and the message body. The 'mms' URI scheme is used to designate an MMS message and the sending of that message from the message originator.</t>
