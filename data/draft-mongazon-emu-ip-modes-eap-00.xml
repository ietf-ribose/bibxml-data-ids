      <t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is defined in [RFC3748].This document defines a mechanism that allows an access network toprovide IP connectivity modes hints to an EAP peer -- the end of thelink that responds to the authenticator. The purpose is to allow theEAP peer in executing in a reliable and efficient manner the IPconnectivity step as soon as the authentication phase completes.This is useful in situations where a peer and the networks it visitssupport various IP connectivity modes. Without the hint, such a peermight fail or take some time to select a valid IP connectivity modeon the visited network. With the help of the hint, a visited networkprovides the peer with a list of supported IP connectivity modes andallows it to execute successfully the convenient IP connectivity assoon as the authentication is complete. The hint is particularlyuseful when users are performing vertical handovers through differentnetwork technologies such as wireless ones.</t>
