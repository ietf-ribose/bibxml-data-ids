      <t>Data Distribution Protocol (DDP) provides a fault tolerant data transfer mechanism over IP networks. DDP uses a name-based addressing model which isolates a logical communication endpoint from its IP address(es), thus effectively eliminating the binding between the communication endpoint and its physical IP address(es) which normally constitutes a single point of failure. In addition, DDP defines each logical communication destination as a named group, providing full transparent support for server-pooling and load sharing. It also allows dynamic system scalability - members of a server pool can be added or removed at any time without interrupting the service. DDP is designed to take full advantage of the network level redundancy provided by the Simple Transmission Control Protocol (SCTP) [1]. But it can also use other transport protocol like TCP. Internally, DDP is made up of two parts, namely the Data Distribution Control Part (DDCP) and the Endpoint Name Resolution Part (ENRP). DDCP provides the user interface for name to address translation, load sharing management, and fault management. ENRP defines the fault tolerant name translation service.</t>
