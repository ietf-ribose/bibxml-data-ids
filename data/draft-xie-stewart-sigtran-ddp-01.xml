      <t>Data Distribution Protocol (DDP) provides a fault tolerant datatransfer mechanism over IP networks. DDP uses a name-based addressingmodel which isolates a logical communication endpoint from its IPaddress(es), thus effectively eliminating the binding between thecommunication endpoint and its physical IP address(es) which normallyconstitutes a single point of failure.In addition, DDP defines each logical communication destination as anamed group, providing full transparent support for server-pooling andload sharing. It also allows dynamic system scalability - members of aserver pool can be added or removed at any time without interruptingthe service.DDP is designed to take full advantage of the network level redundancyprovided by the Simple Transmission Control Protocol (SCTP) [1]. Butit can also use other transport protocol like TCP.Internally, DDP is made up of two parts, namely the Data DistributionControl Part (DDCP) and the Endpoint Name Resolution Part (ENRP).DDCP provides the user interface for name to address translation, loadsharing management, and fault management. ENRP defines the faulttolerant name translation service.</t>
