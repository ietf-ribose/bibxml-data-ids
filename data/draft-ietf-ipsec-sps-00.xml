      <t>This document describes a distributed system that provides the mechanisms needed for discovering, accessing and processing security policy information of hosts, subnets or networks of a security domain. In this system policy clients and servers exchange information using the Security Policy Protocol. The protocol defines how the policy information is exchanged, processed, and protected by clients and servers. The system accommodates topology changes, hence policy changes, rather easily without the scalability constraints imposed by static reconfiguration of each client. The protocol is extensible and flexible. It allows the exchange of complex policy objects between clients and servers.</t>
