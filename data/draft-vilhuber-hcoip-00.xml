      <t>Bandwidth consumption of RTP flows can be reduced by tunneling and compressing headers. This draft defines an IP protocol number and a header which can be used to transport IP Header Compressed [IPHC], Compressed RTP [CRTP], and Enhanced Compressed RTP [ECRTP] packets over an arbitrary IP tunnel (IP-in-IP or ESP, for example) to reduce bandwidth consumption for RTP flows.</t>
