      <t>The Multimob WG has defined a basic mobile multicast solution leveraging on network localized mobility management, i.e. Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol. The basic solution incorporates multicast aware routers co-located with the mobility anchor and a proxy functionality for group management, i.e. IGMP/MLD, at the access gateway. Although such a basic solution solves the issue from an operational point of view, challenges with respect to optimization, e.g. efficient resource utilization, still remain. This document attempts to evaluate proposed solutions for the chartered work item of "PMIPv6 routing optimizations to avoid tunnel convergence problem". A corresponding deployment specific extension would cover dynamic and/or automatic tunnel configuration and a direct or local routing approach.</t>
