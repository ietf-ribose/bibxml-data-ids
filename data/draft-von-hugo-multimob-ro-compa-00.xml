      <t>The Multimob WG has defined a basic mobile multicast solutionleveraging on network localized mobility management, i.e. ProxyMobile IPv6 protocol. The basic solution incorporates multicastaware routers co-located with the mobility anchor and a proxy functionality for group management, i.e. IGMP/MLD, at the accessgateway. Although such a basic solution solves the issue from an operational point of view, challenges with respect to optimization,e.g. efficient resource utilization, still remain.This document attempts to evaluate proposed solutions for thechartered work item of "PMIPv6 routing optimizations to avoid tunnelconvergence problem". A corresponding deployment specific extensionwould cover dynamic and/or automatic tunnel configuration and adirect or local routing approach.</t>
