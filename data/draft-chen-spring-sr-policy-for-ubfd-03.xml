    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes how to leverage Segment Routing (SR) to ensure that the Unaffiliated BFD (U-BFD) Echo packets must reach the remote system before being looped back to the local system. This enables that U-BFD works not only for one hop scenario but for multiple hops scenario as well. In addition, this document also defines a way to explicitly specify the loop back path of the U-BFD Echo packets. This is useful in the case where the forward and reverse path of the Echo packets are required to follow the same path.</t>
