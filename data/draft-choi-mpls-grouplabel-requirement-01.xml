      <t>As the group communication become more important, the special label should be allocated in support of group management and maintenance. The allocation mechanism of a group label can be applied to a point- to-multipoint(P2MP) communication in MPLS networks. Currently used label is locally significant, while this group label should be common object within a single MPLS domain. This document presents a set of requirements for multicast service using a group label over Multiprotocol Label Switching(MPLS). It identifies functional and performance capabilities required to allocate a group label in master-slave network and peer to peer network, which facilitates efficient and reliable group communication and Quality of Service(QoS) in MPLS domain. It also identifies functional capabilities required to implement several services related to Content Distribution Network(CDN) in master-slave network.</t>
