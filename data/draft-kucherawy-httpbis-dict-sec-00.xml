      <t>Data compression algorithms benefit from blocks of tuning data called "dictionaries". These can greatly improve data compression speed and/or ratios, but their use and application has numerous potential security issues of concern to the communities using them. This document enumerates security issues known about compression dictionaries at the time of publication so that future proposals for use of dictionaries can benefit from this collected material.</t>
