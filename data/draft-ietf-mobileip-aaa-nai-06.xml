      <t>When a mobile node moves between two foreign networks it has to bereauthenticated. If the home network has multiple AAA servers thereauthentication request may not be received by the same AAAH asprevious authentication requests.In order for the new AAAH to be able to forward the request to thecorrect HA it has to know the identity of the HA. This documentdefines an extension that enables the HA to pass its identity to themobile node which can in turn pass it to the AAA server when changingpoint of attachment. This document specifies a NAI extension thatcan carry these NAIs.</t>
