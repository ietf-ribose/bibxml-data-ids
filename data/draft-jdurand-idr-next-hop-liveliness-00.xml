      <t>This proposal introduces a new BGP attribute that can be used by BGP routers to advertise their capability to support any kind of host liveliness checking protocols (for example BFD). This attribute can be used to avoid black-holes scenarios seen when BGP next-hop is not the peer, in particular on Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) implementing BGP Route-Servers. IXP member routers can exchange their capability to implement a given host liveliness checking Foreword A placeholder to list general observations about this document.</t>
