      <t>The Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has limited support for the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). The current version only includes support for three Elliptic Curve groups, and there is a fixed hash algorithm tied to each group. This document generalizes IKEv2 signature support to allow any signature method supported by PKIX and also adds signature hash algorithm negotiation. This is a generic mechanism and is not limited to ECDSA; it can also be used with other signature algorithms.</t>
