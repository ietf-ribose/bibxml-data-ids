      <t>Collecting Resource availability information in Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) devices in real time helps in better managebility of resources in the SIP network. Resource availability monitoring in SIP devices helps administrator to take informed decision and corrective measures to tackle under or over resource utilization in the network. Resource availability information can also be used for SIP overload control in SIP based Media servers by passing resource demand vector between devices. This document defines resource availability XML document and the mechanisms that can be used to exchange the document between SIP entities.</t>
