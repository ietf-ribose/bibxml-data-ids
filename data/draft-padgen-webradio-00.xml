      <t>Organisations such as BBC Monitoring monitor radio and television broadcasts worldwide. Traditional monitoring methods incur expensive international telephone call charges. This document describes a system whereby remote broadcasts can be monitored using a computer connected to a radio or television receiver and to the Internet, using inexpensive local calls to its local Internet Service Provider. This document also defines the protocol used between the central server and the remote clients which implement this system.</t>
