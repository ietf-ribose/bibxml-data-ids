    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines path management procedures for QUIC that operate independently of the connection management procedures defined in RFC9000. The path management procedures enable a multipath configuration between endpoints by allowing QUIC packets associated with any connection identifier to be transported over any of the paths established between the endpoints. As a consequence, the principles and operations of RFC9000 are retained regardless of the path used to a convey QUIC packet.</t>
