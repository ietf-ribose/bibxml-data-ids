      <t>PMIPv6 and MIPv6 are respectively the leading protocols for network based and client based mobility. As backward compatibility is an important feature, IPv4 support for PMIPv6 and MIPv6 becomes mandatory. This document highlights some scenarios for PMIPv6-MIPv6 interaction with IPv4 support as well as some proposed solutions.</t>
