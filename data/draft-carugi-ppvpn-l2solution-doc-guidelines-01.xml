      <t>This document provides guidelines on how to structure a PPVPN Layer 2 solution document. The intent is to provide a common way of describing the various functional components of a Layer 2 solution, making easier their identification as well as the mechanisms providing those functionalities, and, possibly, facilitating further convergence in the solution space. These guidelines have been discussed internally to the PPVPN Layer 2 design team and agreed as a recommendation, although not mandatory, to authors of PPVPN L2 solution drafts.</t>
