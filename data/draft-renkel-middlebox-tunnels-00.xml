      <t>This Internet Draft compares Network Address Translation (NAT) andRealm Specific IP (RSIP) tunnels, and the advantages anddisadvantages of each. It then shows how the advantages can becombined by implementing NAT as a tunnel in hosts, whileminimizing the disadvantages. Based on the advantages of middleboxtunnels in general and implementing NAT as a middlebox tunnel inparticular, it then recommends that the Middlebox Communicationsarchitecture protocol (MIDCOM) be amended to support tunnelsbetween hosts and middleboxes.This .txt version of this internet draft is identical to thePostScript version (draft-renkel-middlebox-tunnels-00.ps) exceptthat the figures from the PostScript version have been deleted.Please refer to the PostScript version for these figures.</t>
