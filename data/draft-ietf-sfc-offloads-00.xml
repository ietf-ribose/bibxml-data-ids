      <t>Service Function Chaining (SFC) enables services to be delivered by selective traffic steering through an ordered set of service functions. Once classified into an SFC, the traffic for a given flow is steered through all the service functions of the SFC for the life of the traffic flow even though this is often not necessary. Steering traffic to service functions only while required and not otherwise, leads to shorter SFC forwarding paths with improved latencies, reduced resource consumption and better user experience. This document describes the rationale, techniques and necessary protocol extensions to achieve such optimization, with focus on one such technique termed "simple offloads".</t>
