      <t>We propose extensions to RSVP-TE to allow the establishment oftraffic engineered LSPs with fast restoration requirements. We firstdiscuss the problem ofestablishing explicitly routed interdomain LSPs and show that thecurrent subobjects found in RSVP-TE are not sufficient to establishinterdomain LSPs because they do not take into account the policyconstraints of the interdomain environment. We then show how toextend the fast-reroute and detour objects to protect interdomainlinks and ASBRs on interdomain LSPs. We also discuss theestablishment of disjoint interdomain LSPs for restoration and loadbalancing purposes in the appendix. Finally, we describe thenecessary RSVP objects and flags and discuss the impact of theproposed solution on the syntax of existing RSVP-TE objects and thesyntax of new required objects are presented.</t>
