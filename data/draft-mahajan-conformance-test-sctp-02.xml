      <t>This document presents the conformance test specification for SCTP prototcol (ver 07), which can be used to test SCTP implementations for conformance to the protocol definition. The list of test is exhaustive and covers almost all the categories of test, except few (test for timer calculation and congestion) which will be added in the next revision of the draft. This draft can also be used in conjunction with SCTP specification by implementor of protocol as implementors guide, as the pictorial representation of various scenarios help understand the protocol. Next revision of the draft will also cover the additions done to the protocol revision SCTP-09 and any subsequent RFC published by IETF.</t>
