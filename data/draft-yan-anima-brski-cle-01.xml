      <t>The Class 1 constrained IoT devices, defined in RFC7228, may be unable to use certificates within limited RAM. Exiting enrollment protocols of BRSKI are all using certificates. This document defines a certificateless enrollment framework in BRSKI (BRSKI-CLE) for constrained IoT devices. Considering the evolution towards quantum- safe algorithms, the framework is based on Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM). Cooperating with the authentication mechanism shown in I-D.selander-lake-authz, a constrained IoT device does not need to configure a public key to identify itself for the whole bootstrapping process. An authentication centre (AC) is used for issuing lightweight credentials, such as CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs), to constrained IoT devices. This document does not specify any lightweight credentials.</t>
