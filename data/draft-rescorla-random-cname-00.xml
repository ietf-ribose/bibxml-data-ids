      <t>RFC 6222 describes a number of mechanisms for generating a unique CNAME Unfortunately, these algorithms are rather complicated and also produce CNAMEs which in some cases are potentially linkable over multiple RTCP sessions even if a new CNAME is generated for each session. This document specifies a replacement algorithm for the algorithm in Section 5 which does not have this limitation and is also simpler to implement.</t>
