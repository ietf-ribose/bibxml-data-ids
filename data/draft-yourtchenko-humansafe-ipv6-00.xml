    <abstract>
      <t>Although the IPv6 address space within a single /64 subnet is very large, the typical distribution of the addresses in this space is very non-uniform. This non-uniformity, together with the dictionary- based DNS brute-force enumeration, allows practical remote mapping of the IPv6 addresses in these subnets. This document proposes a technique which can be used to decrease the exposure of the server subnets to trivial scanning. As a side effect, the proposed technique allows to drastically simplify the address management.</t>
