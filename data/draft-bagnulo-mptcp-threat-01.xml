      <t>Multi-addresses/Multi-path TCP (MPTCP for short) describes theextensions proposed for TCP so that each endpoint of a given TCPconnection can use multiple IP addresses to exchange data (instead ofa single IP address per endpoint as currently defined). Suchextensions enable the exchange of segments using different source-destination address pairs, resulting in the capability of usingmultiple paths in a significant number of scenarios. In particular,some level of multihoming and mobility support can be achievedthrough these extensions. However, the support for multiple IPaddresses per endpoint may have implications on the security of theresulting MPTCP protocol. This note includes a threat analysis forMPTCP.</t>
