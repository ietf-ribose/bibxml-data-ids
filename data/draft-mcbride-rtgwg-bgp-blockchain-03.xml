    <abstract>
      <t>A variety of mechanisms have been developed and deployed over the years to secure BGP including the more recent RPKI/ROA mechanisms. Is it also possible to use a distributed ledger such as Blockchain to secure BGP? BGP provides decentralized connectivity across the Internet. Blockchain provides decentralized secure transactions in a append-only, tamper-resistant ledger. This document reviews possible opportunities of using Blockchain to secure BGP policies within a domain and across the global Internet. We propose that BGP data could be placed in a blockchain and smart contracts can control how the data is managed. This could create a single source of truth, something for which blockchains are particularly well suited.</t>
