    <abstract>
      <t>A significant impediment to the widespread adoption of the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) [RFC8555] is that ACME clients need to be pre-configured with the URL of the ACME server to be used. This often leaves domain owners at the mercy of their hosting provider as to which Certification Authorities (CAs) can be used. This specification provides a mechanism to bootstrap ACME client configuration from a domain's DNS CAA Resource Record [RFC8659], thus giving control of which CA(s) to use back to the domain owner. Specifically, this document specifies two new extensions to the DNS CAA Resource Record: the "discovery" and "priority" parameters. Additionally, it registers the URI "/.well-known/acme" at which all compliant ACME servers will host their ACME directory object. By retrieving instructions for the ACME client from the authorized CA(s), this mechanism allows for the domain owner to configure multiple CAs in either load-balanced or fallback prioritizations which improves user preferences and increases diversity in certificate issuers.</t>
