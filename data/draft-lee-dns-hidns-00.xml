    <abstract>
      <t>Formally, the Domain Name System (DNS) has the capability to resolve any registered name to its associated data. However, current heterogeneous identifiers (such as DOI, Handle, Ecode, etc.) rely on isolated and incompatible resolution systems, leading to fragmented client implementations and failing to fully leverage the existing Internet infrastructure. This specification defines an operational practice that achieves DNS-based heterogeneous identifier resolution by mapping identifier values to dedicated DNS namespaces under the authority of their respective identifier systems. This mapping follows standardized rules compatible with the Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) framework, allowing identifiers to be converted into domain names that can be resolved through standard DNS queries (for A, AAAA, or CNAME records). This approach establishes a unified semantic scope for identifier resolution, providing clients with a single, consistent access interface. Its primary advantage lies in integrating diverse identifier systems into the robust, scalable, and globally deployed DNS infrastructure, thereby simplifying client development and improving overall resolution efficiency.</t>
