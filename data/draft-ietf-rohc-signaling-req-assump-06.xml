      <t>In wireless environments and especially in cellular systems, e.g. GSM(Global System for Mobile communications) and UMTS (Universal MobileTelecommunications System), there is a need to maximize the transportefficiency for data over the radio interface. With the introductionof SIP/SDP (Session Initiation Protocol/Session Description Protocol)to cellular devices, compression of the signaling messages should beconsidered in order to improve both service availability and quality,mainly by reducing the user idle time, e.g. at call setup. Thepurpose of this document is to outline requirements and motivationsfor development of a scheme for compression and decompression ofmessages from signaling protocols.</t>
