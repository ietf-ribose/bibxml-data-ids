    <abstract>
      <t>The advent of switched multi-channel (WDM) optical networks using OXCs (Optical Cross-connects) presents many new opportunities for supporting faster and more flexible provision of IP services. Key to realizing such opportunities is providing the ability to automatically set-up and tear-down paths (optical channels) across the optical network, and provide means for IP services to leverage this capability. Therefore, it is necessary to establish supporting protocols and mechanisms. In this draft we study the requirements and mechanisms for optical network topology discovery, signaling path setup, data path computation, and optical channel set-up. We leverage MPLS and other IP based protocols as a basis for achieving the above objectives.</t>
