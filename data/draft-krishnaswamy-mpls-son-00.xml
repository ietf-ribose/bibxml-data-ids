    <abstract>
      <t>The advent of switched multi-channel (WDM) optical networks usingOXCs (Optical Cross-connects) presents many new opportunities forsupporting faster and more flexible provision of IP services. Key torealizing such opportunities is providing the ability toautomatically set-up and tear-down paths (optical channels) acrossthe optical network, and provide means for IP services to leveragethis capability. Therefore, it is necessary to establish supportingprotocols and mechanisms. In this draft we study the requirements andmechanisms for optical network topology discovery, signaling pathsetup, data path computation, and optical channel set-up. We leverageMPLS and other IP based protocols as a basis for achieving the aboveobjectives.</t>
