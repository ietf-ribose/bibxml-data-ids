      <t>The delivery of inappropriate video content for OTT and Social Media with HTTP video streaming is a serious worldwide problem. Most of the countries have established age-related and parental guidelines to warn about inappropriate or unintended content, particularly for children. However, these guidelines do not offer the freedom or convenience for audiences to avoid consumption of inappropriate content for their target age group instead just provide warning messages only.The Age-Relevant Video Content Guidelines (VCG) Standard defines a standard meta data format which covers fully and partially scene by scene age relevancy meta data for video and audio content and hence establishes a mechanism for delivering video and audio content tailored to the viewers' age groups. The Video Content Guidelines(VCG) is a meta data file which can enable existing HTTP based adaptive streaming standard like HLS, DASH, CMAF, MSS and HDS with updating manifest file using VCG meta data, that ensures only the target age-appropriate content is delivered to the audience and in-appropriate data can be skipped or modified so that different age group audience can choose what they want to watch. This ensures the compatibility of with the standard adaptive streaming protocols and players, so that the existing social Media and OTT streaming infrastructure continue to work without any major changes.</t>
