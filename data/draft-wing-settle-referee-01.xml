      <t>Obtaining and maintaining PKI certificates for devices in a local domain network is difficult for both technical and human factors reasons. This document describes an alternative approach to securely identify and authenticate servers in the local domain using a HTTPS- based trust anchor system, called a Referee. The Referee allows bootstrapping a network of devices by trusting only the Referee trust anchor in the local domain.</t>
