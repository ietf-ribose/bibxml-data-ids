      <t>RBridges are link layer devices that use routing protocols as a control plane but do not target to scale up to large campus networks. This document contains an alternative proposal to link-state RBridges, named ABridges. ABridges overcome RBridges L2 network size restrictions allowing applicability to very large Ethernet campus networks while maintaining zero configuration and high performance, by assuming a topological restriction that is automatically performed. The proposal includes a two-layered network architecture with two hierarchical independent spanning tree layers. Expected convergence is fast, probably below two seconds.</t>
