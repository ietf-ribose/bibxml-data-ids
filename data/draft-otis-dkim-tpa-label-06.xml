      <t>A third party authorization label (TPA-Label) is a DNS-basedextension for DKIM ADSP records that allows domains in the Fromheader field to authorize acceptable third-party signatures. Thisapproach allows autonomous and unilateral authorizations for third-party domains using scalable, individual DNS transactions. Theextended scope of DKIM signing practice assertions introduced heresupplants transparent authorization schemes that are more difficultto administer. Alternatives for facilitating third-partyauthorizations currently necessitate coordination between two or moredomains to synchronously set up selector/key DNS records, DNS zonedelegations, and/or a regular exchange of public/private keys.Checking TPA-Label Resource Records for signing practices might occurinfrequently when a message is not compliant with restrictive ADSPpractices, where an Author Domain Signature is either missing orinvalid. When a third-party signature is found, TPA-Label ResourceRecord transactions offer an efficient means for Author Domains toauthorize specific third-party signing domains. Recipients areafforded a method to determine whether authorization exists insituations where other modes of authorization are impractical. TPA-Label Resource Records permit Author Domains a means to influencemessage handling selectively, for messages otherwise lacking validAuthor Domain signatures.</t>
