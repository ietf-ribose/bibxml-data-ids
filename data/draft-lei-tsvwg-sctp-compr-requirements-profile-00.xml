      <t>This document is to specify the requirements to compress headers ofIP/SCTP package and how ROHC mechanism compresses SCTP. StreamingControl Transport Protocol is new generation IP transport protocolwhich has been published in RFC2960 and updated by RFC4960. SCTP canmaintain association among multiple peers, thus supports multiplehoming and multiple streaming, while inherits most functions of TCP.SCTP as transport protocol has been used to carry signaling orpossible user plane data in turbulence network which needs to savespectrum resource by compressing IP headers.</t>
