    <abstract>
      <t>An EVPN Inter-Domain interconnect solution is required if two or more sites of the same Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN) are attached to different IGP domains or Autonomous Systems (AS), and they need to communicate. The Inter-Domain Option-B connectivity model is one of the most popular solutions for such EVPN connectivity. While multiple documents refer to this type of interconnect solution and specify different aspects of it, there is no document that summarizes the impact of the Inter-Domain Option-B connectivity in the EVPN procedures. This document does not specify new procedures but analyses the EVPN procedures in an Inter-Domain Option-B network and suggests potential solutions for the described issues. Those solutions are based on either other specifications or based on local implementations that do not modify the end-to-end EVPN control plane.</t>
