      <t>The length of IP prefixes is an information used by forwarding and routing processes is policy-based. As such, no maximum length must be assumed by design. Discussions on the 64-bit boundary in IPv6 addressing revealed a need for a clear recommendation on which bits must be used by forwarding decision-making processes. This document sketches a recommendation to be followed by forwarding and routing designs with regards to the prefix length. The aim is to avoid hard-coded routing and forwarding designs that exclude some IP prefix lengths.</t>
