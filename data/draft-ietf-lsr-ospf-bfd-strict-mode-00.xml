    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the extensions to OSPF that enables a router and its neighbor to signal their intention to use Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for their adjacency using link-local advertisement between them. The signaling of this BFD enablement, allows the router to block and not allow the establishment of adjacency with its neighbor router until a BFD session is successfully established between them. The document describes this OSPF "strict-mode" of BFD establishment as a prerequisite to adjacency formation.</t>
