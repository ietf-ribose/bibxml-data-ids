      <t>The Simple Mail Transport Protocol currently doesn't verify the authenticity of the message such that it allows spammers and scammersto exist without fear of retribution. This is due in part to the factthat almost all data contained within the DATA section of an SMTP mail transport can be spoofed. The SSMTP protocol would alleviate much of this concern.</t>
