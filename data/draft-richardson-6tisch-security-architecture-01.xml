      <t>This document details minimal layer-2 requirements for 6top use in industrial settings, and a few options for accomplishing this. The layer-2 mechanism is then extended to provide for per-node authentication and authorization of the node/PCE communications. This internet-draft is intended for later inclusion into the 6tisch architecture document. This might be the worst written internet draft yet. You have been warned</t>
