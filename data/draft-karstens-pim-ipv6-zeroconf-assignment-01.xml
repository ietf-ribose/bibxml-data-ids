    <abstract>
      <t>Marine networks contain a combination of sensors, controls, and displays. The latest marine industry standards require IPv6. The most optimal way to distribute sensor data to all displays on the network is multicast. However, use of traditional switches can be problematic (overwhelm links) when both high-bandwidth and low- bandwidth devices are installed. To solve this problem, the network requires switches with multicast snooping. However, source-specific multicast (SSM) is not supported on marine switches so the destination address is the only way to differentiate multicast streams. This limitation creates several challenges including with the pre-allocation of multicast group addresses. The solution, described in this draft, provides a decentralized, zero-configuration method for dynamically assigning multicast group addresses through defining an extension to the multicast portion of the IPv6 addressing architecture along with a new table in the IPv6 Multicast Address Space Registry.</t>
