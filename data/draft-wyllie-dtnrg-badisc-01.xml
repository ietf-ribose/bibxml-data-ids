      <t>In Delay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN), Bundle Agents form an overlay network that forwards DTN bundles between their source and destination applications. This document describes a mechanism that Bundle Agents can use to discover when they are in contact with one another and optionally provide information on the additional properties of current or future contacts, such as duration and capabilities. This information can be used to trigger bundle forwarding or make future bundle scheduling decisions.</t>
