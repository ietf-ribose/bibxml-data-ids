      <t>Demultiplexing and decoding an MPEG2 Transport Stream (MPEG2-TS)requires the knowledge of specific information about the transportstream, which we refer to as the MPEG2-TS Preamble. While thisinformation is spread over different locations throughout thetransport stream and can be eventually assembled after some time areceiver started receiving the MPEG2-TS, the time it takes toretrieve all this information (especially in multicast environments)may be long. Instead, having this information readily available as aPreamble and sending the Preamble to a receiver that will shortlystart receiving the transport stream will virtually eliminate thewaiting time and let the receiver start processing/decoding theMPEG2-TS sooner. In this document, we give an overview of theMPEG2-TS and the delay components in video systems, and motivate theneed for constructing and using the MPEG2-TS Preamble for rapidlyacquiring the source stream in RTP multicast sessions. We alsodefine and register the RTP payload format for the MPEG2-TS Preamble.</t>
