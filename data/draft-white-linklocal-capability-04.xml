    <abstract>
      <t>BGP[RFC4271], was originally designed to provide reachability between domains and between the edges of a domain. As such, BGP assumes the next hop towards any reachable destination may not reside on the advertising speaker, but rather may either be through a router connected to the same subnet as the speaker, or through a router only reachable by traversing multiple hops through the network. Because of this, as per [RFC4291] - BGP does not recognize IPv6 link-local addresses, as a valid next hop for the forwarding purposes. However, in many current deplyments, BGP peering is often deployed on point-to-point links in networks where multihop reachability of any kind is not assumed or desired (all next hops are assumed to be the speaker reachable through a directly connected point-to-point link). This is common, for instance, in data center fabrics[RFC7938]. In these situations, a global IPv6 address is not required for the advertisement of reachability information; in fact, providing global IPv6 addresses in these kinds of networks can be detrimental to Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP). This draft standardizes the operation of BGP over a point-to-point link using link-local IPv6 addressing only. Since link-local IPv6 addresses are not required to be globally unique, implementations must ensure that they are strictly associated with a specific interface.</t>
