      <t>The IETF PCN Working Group has continued its work investigating pre-congestion and admission control mechanisms. This work hasprogressed under the current charter, but has not yet consideredrelated legacy PSTN interactions or the need for ubiquitousconnectivity between users on dissimilar networks. The PCN chartercould be improved by a strong positive statement to the effectcommitting to future work addressing legacy networks.In that light, please consider the questions below which includedifferential PCN treatment based on traffic types, security, and PSTNinteroperability concerns. It seems helpful to have a touchstone ofsome concerns relative to the PSTN network and IP network Gateway inorder to confirm that they will be addressed in future work. Thisattempt is motivated by a desire to avoid the accidental omission ofa topic that may be hard to "retrofit" in later.</t>
