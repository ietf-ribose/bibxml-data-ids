      <t>This document specifies an Automatic Extended Route Optimization (AERO) service for IP internetworking over Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI) interfaces. AERO/OMNI use an IPv6 link-local address format that supports operation of the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (IPv6 ND) protocol. Prefix delegation/registration services are employed for network admission and to manage the IP forwarding and routing systems. Secure multilink operation, mobility management, multicast, traffic selector signaling and route optimization are naturally supported through dynamic neighbor cache updates. AERO is a widely- applicable mobile internetworking service especially well-suited to aviation services, intelligent transportation systems, mobile end user devices and many other applications.</t>
