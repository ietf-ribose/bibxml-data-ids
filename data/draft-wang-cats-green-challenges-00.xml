    <abstract>
      <t>As mobile edge computing networks sink computing tasks from cloud data centers to the edge of the network, tasks need to be processed by computing resources close to the user side. Therefore, CATS was raised. Reducing carbon footprint is a major challenge of our time. Networks are the main enablers of carbon reductions. The introduction of computing dimension in CATS makes it insufficient to consider the energy saving of network dimension in the past, so the green for CATS based on network and computing combination is worth exploring. This document outlines a series of challenges and associated research to explore ways to reduce carbon footprint and reduce network energy based on CATS.</t>
