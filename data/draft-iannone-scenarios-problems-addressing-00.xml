    <abstract>
      <t>The Internet Protocol (IP) has been the major technological success in information technology of the last half century. As the Internet becomes pervasive, IP has been replacing communication technology for many domain-specific solutions. However, domains with specific requirements as well as communication behaviors and semantics still exist and represent what [RFC8799] recognizes as "limited domains". This document describes well-recognized scenarios that showcase possibly different addressing requirements, which are challenging to be accommodated in the IP addressing model. These scenarios highlight issues related to the Internet addressing model and call for starting a discussion on a way to re-think/evolve the addressing model so to better accommodate different domain-specific requirements. The limitations identified in this document are complemented and deepened by a detailed analysis in a separate companion document [I-D.iannone-internet-addressing-considerations].</t>
