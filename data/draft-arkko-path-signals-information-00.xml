      <t>Path signals are messages seen by on-path elements examining transport protocols. Current preference for good protocol design indicates desire for constructing explict rather than implicit signals to carry information. For instance, the ability of various middleboxes to read TCP messaging was an implicit signal that lead to difficulties in evolving the TCP protocol without breaking connectivity through some of those middleboxes. This document discusses the types of information that could be passed in these path signals, and provides some advice on what types of information might be provided in a beneficial manner, and which information might be less likely to be revealed or used by applications or networks.</t>
