      <t>Due to fact that mobile ad hoc nodes have a critical need to preserve battery power, MANET routing protocols need to consider power saving techniques during operations. In this Internet-Draft we discuss PARO, a Power-Aware Routing Optimization protocol that minimizes the transmission power necessary to forward packets between wireless devices. Using PARO, intermediate nodes can forward packets between source-destination pairs thus reducing the aggregate transmission power consumed by wireless devices. An important property of PARO is that it outperforms traditional broadcast-based routing protocols due to its power efficient point-to-point on-demand nature. The protocol is designed to operate as a stand-alone multihop routing protocol for local-area wireless networks (e.g., single-hop home networks, single- hop sensor networks, WLANs, etc.) and as a power-aware enhancement for routing in wide-area MANETs.</t>
