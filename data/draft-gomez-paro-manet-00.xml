      <t>Due to fact that mobile ad hoc nodes have a critical need to preservebattery power, MANET routing protocols need to consider power savingtechniques during operations. In this Internet-Draft we discuss PARO,a Power-Aware Routing Optimization protocol that minimizes thetransmission power necessary to forward packets between wirelessdevices. Using PARO, intermediate nodes can forward packets betweensource-destination pairs thus reducing the aggregate transmissionpower consumed by wireless devices. An important property of PARO isthat it outperforms traditional broadcast-based routing protocols dueto its power efficient point-to-point on-demand nature. The protocolis designed to operate as a stand-alone multihop routing protocol forlocal-area wireless networks (e.g., single-hop home networks, single-hop sensor networks, WLANs, etc.) and as a power-aware enhancementfor routing in wide-area MANETs.</t>
