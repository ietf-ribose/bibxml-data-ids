      <t>This document describes an extension to the HTTP/1.1 state managementmechanism described in [Kristol]. This mechanism, 'trust-labels',associates digitally signed labels with Set-Cookie or Set-Cookie2headers. The labels allow additional semantics to attach to cookiesand cookie processing, and the digital signatures allow trust modelsto be associated with processing rules for labeled cookies.The intent is to provide a mechanism that allows user agentimplementors to implement evaluation of the authenticity and contentof cookie-associated labels, and to implement additional processingrules for cookie handling. The intended use is browser determinationof server privacy practices and acceptance, rejection, modificationor redirection of cookies based on those practices. The more generaluse of trust model scoped, label semantic scoped processing of HTTPstate artifacts is not precluded by this intended use.</t>
