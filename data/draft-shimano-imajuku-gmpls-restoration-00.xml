      <t>There are some efforts to categorize restoration schemes [Restoration-analysis]. We consider that pre-planned restoration has some advantages, for instance, enhancing the quickness to reduce downtime, extensions to recovery classes, risk management, and totally integrated distributed control. This document describes some requirements and extended properties for message objects on RSVP-TE [RSVP-GMPLS], LSR procedures, and pre-planned GMPLS restoration. We append a procedure to the recovery steps for working and restoration setup. Some objects are additionally required with respect to establishing working LSPs and reservation of restoration LSPs. This document shows that restoration activation is also needed and clarifies the required properties.</t>
