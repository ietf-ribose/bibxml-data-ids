      <t>This document defines the experimental multiplexing protocol referred to as 'WebMUX'. WebMUX is a session management protocol separating the underlying transport from the upper level application protocols. It provides a lightweight communication channel to the application layer by multiplexing data streams on top of a reliable stream oriented transport. By supporting coexistence of multiple application level protocols (e.g. HTTP and HTTP/NG), WebMUX should ease transitions to future Web protocols, and communications of client applets using private protocols with servers over the same TCP connection as the HTTP conversation. WebMUX is intended for, but by no means restricted to, transport of Web related protocols; the name has been chosen to reduce confusion with other existing multiplexing protocols. This document is part of a suite of documents describing the HTTP-NG design and prototype implementation: * HTTP-NG Short- and Longterm Goals, ID * HTTP-NG Architectural Model, ID * HTTP-NG Wire Protocol, ID * The Classic Web Interfaces in HTTP-NG, ID * Description of the HTTP-NG Testbed, ID</t>
