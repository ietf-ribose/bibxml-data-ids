      <t>This document defines the experimental multiplexing protocol referred to as'WebMUX'. WebMUX is a session management protocol separating the underlyingtransport from the upper level application protocols. It provides a lightweightcommunication channel to the application layer by multiplexing data streams ontop of a reliable stream oriented transport. By supporting coexistence ofmultiple application level protocols (e.g. HTTP and HTTP/NG), WebMUX should easetransitions to future Web protocols, and communications of client applets usingprivate protocols with servers over the same TCP connection as the HTTPconversation. WebMUX is intended for, but by no means restricted to, transport of Web relatedprotocols; the name has been chosen to reduce confusion with other existingmultiplexing protocols. This document is part of a suite of documents describing the HTTP-NG design andprototype implementation: * HTTP-NG Short- and Longterm Goals, ID * HTTP-NG Architectural Model, ID * HTTP-NG Wire Protocol, ID * The Classic Web Interfaces in HTTP-NG, ID * Description of the HTTP-NG Testbed, ID</t>
