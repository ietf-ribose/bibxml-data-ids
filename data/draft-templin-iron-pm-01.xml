      <t>The Internet Routing Overlay Network (IRON) is a new internetworking architecture based on encapsulation of inner network layer packets within outer network layer headers using a non-broadcast, multiple access (NBMA) virtual interface model. IRON suggests a third-party global deployment of servers and relays to achieve a Provider- Independent (PI) routing and addressing framework, but there may be instances in which an Internet Service Provider (ISP) wishes to manage its own IRON deployment. This document presents a Provider- Managed IRON framework that offers a fast path alternative for deployment of a long term solution.</t>
