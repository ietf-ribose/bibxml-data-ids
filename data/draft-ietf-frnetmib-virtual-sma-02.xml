      <t>This document presents the Service Management Architecture, an architectural framework for defining SNMP MIB modules for Customer Network Management (CNM) of network services over connection-oriented networks. The work is motivated by the fundamental differences in management views and functionality between a service provider and a service customer. Differences between service provider and service customer include whole-network vs. network-portion view, direct vs. indirect management, and physical vs. logical view. These fundamental differences suggest a difference in philosophy between Service Management and Device Management. Much work has been done and experience gained in writing Device MIB modules for hands-on management of physical devices, but defining Service MIB modules is a relatively new area and requires the development of a new architectural framework.</t>
