      <t>This document describes the Spinel protocol, which facilitates the control and management of IPv6 network interfaces on devices where general purpose application processors offload network functions at their interfaces to network co-processors (NCP) connected by simple communication links like serial data channels. While initially developed to support Thread(R), Spinel's layered design allows it to be easily adapted to other similar network technologies. This document also describes various Spinel specializations, including support for the Thread(R) low-power mesh network technology.</t>
