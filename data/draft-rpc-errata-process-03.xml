    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the current web-based process for handling the submission, verification, and posting of errata for the RFC Series. The main concepts behind this process are (1) distributing the responsibility for verification to the appropriate organization or person for each RFC stream, and (2) using a Web portal to automate the processing of erratum reports. This system was launched in November 2007. This draft documents the existing system as a means to facilitate discussion to revamp how errata are reported, reviewed, and publicized.</t>
