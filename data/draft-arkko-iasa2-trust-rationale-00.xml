      <t>The IASA 2.0 changes will have an impact in the IETF Trust as well, because members of the IET Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) IAOC have also served as trustees of the IETF Trust. A proposal for a minimal change regarding this has been provided separately in [I-D.arkko-iasa2-trust-update]. This companion memo provides some background on the details of the current IETF Trust arrangements, explains the effect of the rules in the founding documents during a transition to a new arrangement, and provides a rationale for the update. This memo is provided only for discussion.</t>
