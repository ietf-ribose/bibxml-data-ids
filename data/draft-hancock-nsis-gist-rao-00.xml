      <t>The Generic Internet Signalling Transport (GIST) protocol depends on packet interception to identify the nodes that should participate in signalling sessions. The base protocol assumes n-tuple analysis of the packet header as the interception algorithm. This document describes an experimental extension to GIST to use the Router Alert Option (RAO) to enhance interception efficiency. It describes the tradeoffs in using such an approach including the impact on legacy equipment and protocol deployability, and also the considerations to be taken into account in selecting values for the RAO value field.</t>
