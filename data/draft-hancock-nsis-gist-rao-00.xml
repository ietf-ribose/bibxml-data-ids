      <t>The Generic Internet Signalling Transport (GIST) protocol depends onpacket interception to identify the nodes that should participate insignalling sessions. The base protocol assumes n-tuple analysis ofthe packet header as the interception algorithm. This documentdescribes an experimental extension to GIST to use the Router AlertOption (RAO) to enhance interception efficiency. It describes thetradeoffs in using such an approach including the impact on legacyequipment and protocol deployability, and also the considerations tobe taken into account in selecting values for the RAO value field.</t>
