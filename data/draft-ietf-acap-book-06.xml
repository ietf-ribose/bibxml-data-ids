      <t>Storing URLs [URL] for later access has become common in Internet applications (for example, web browsers, FTP clients); these saved URLs have become known as bookmarks. It would be desirable to access one's bookmarks from multiple clients and multiple machines. The Application Configuration Access Protocol [ACAP] provides an ideal mechanism for storage of bookmarks, providing for ease of coordination and synchronization of bookmarks between diverse applications and systems, as well as for hierarchy, inheritance, and sharing between users. This specification defines a standard ACAP dataset class for bookmarks.</t>
