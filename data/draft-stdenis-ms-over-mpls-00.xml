      <t>This document describes a generalized approach to carrying Multi-service protocol data units (PDUs) over an MPLS Network. Thisproposal defines standard MPLS encapsulations that support permanentvirtual circuit (PVC) and switch virtual circuit (SVC) networking.The goal of this draft is to provide a framework that allows an MPLSnetwork to support a range of services from simple circuit emulationservices, to complete network inter-working. There are two distinctaspects to these services: the data plane and the control plane. Thedata plane must be defined to support nailed-up and switchedservices. This architecture covers the data plane but not thecomplete procedures for the control plane. The control plane is onlydefined from a nailed up perspective. The control plane for dynamicservices maybe supported by other signaling protocols such as PNNI.Non MPLS signaling is not covered by this draft.</t>
