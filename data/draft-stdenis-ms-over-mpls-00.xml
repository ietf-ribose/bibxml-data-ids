    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a generalized approach to carrying Multi- service protocol data units (PDUs) over an MPLS Network. This proposal defines standard MPLS encapsulations that support permanent virtual circuit (PVC) and switch virtual circuit (SVC) networking. The goal of this draft is to provide a framework that allows an MPLS network to support a range of services from simple circuit emulation services, to complete network inter-working. There are two distinct aspects to these services: the data plane and the control plane. The data plane must be defined to support nailed-up and switched services. This architecture covers the data plane but not the complete procedures for the control plane. The control plane is only defined from a nailed up perspective. The control plane for dynamic services maybe supported by other signaling protocols such as PNNI. Non MPLS signaling is not covered by this draft.</t>
