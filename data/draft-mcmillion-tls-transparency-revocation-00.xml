    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes reliable mechanisms for the publication and revocation of Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates. This reliability takes several forms. First, it provides browsers a strong guarantee that all certificates they accept are truly published and unrevoked at the time they're accepted. Second, it allows operators to monitor for mis-issuances related to their websites in a highly efficient way without relying on third-party services. Third, it provides a high degree of operational redundancy to minimize the risk of cascading outages.</t>
