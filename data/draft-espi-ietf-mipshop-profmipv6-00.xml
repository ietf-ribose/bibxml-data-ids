      <t>The Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) protocol was developedfrom the experience of MIPv6 and the facilities provided by linklayer triggers, allowing for a proactive approach to handover thatminimises packet exchange delay and packet loss. On completion ofhandover, the mobile node engages MIPv6 procedures in to update theHome Agent with the mobile node's new location. Subsequently, themobile node may carry out Return Routability with the correspondentnode(s) for route optimization. However, this method leaves scope tooptimize handover delays derived from the signalling messageexchange.This document proposes an enhancement to FMIPv6, the Proactive RouteOptimization for FMIPv6 (PRO-FMIPv6) protocol, which aims to furtherreduce the signalling load thereby improving the overall performanceof the handover process.</t>
