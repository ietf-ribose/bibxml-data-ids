    <abstract>
      <t>Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) is a new player towards autonomous vehicles in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). An SDV is constructed by a software platform like a cloud-native system (e.g., Kubernetes) and has its internal network. To facilitate the easy and efficient configuration of networks in the SDV, an intent-based management is an appropriate direction. This document proposes a framework of intent-based management for networks, security, and applications in SDVs so that they can communicate with other SDVs and infrastructure nodes for safe driving and infotainment services in the road networks.</t>
