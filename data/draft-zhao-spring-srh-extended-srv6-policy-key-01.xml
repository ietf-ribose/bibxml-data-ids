      <t>This paper introduces a new extension header, the SRv6 Policy Key, which addresses the issues of timeliness and accuracy in controller- aware path management within SRv6 networks. By adding a unique path identifier to the message header, this scheme enables network nodes to report path information to the controller. This ensures that the controller maintains a real-time and accurate view of the SR path status, even if the SID is lost during transmission or if the controller cannot monitor it in real time and accurately. The approach aims to enhance network availability and operational efficiency, particularly in scenarios involving multi-path tunnel configurations and load balancing.</t>
