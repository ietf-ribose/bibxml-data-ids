    <abstract>
      <t>In a mobile network, when a mobile device (referred to as User Equipment or UE) moves from one Access Node (source AN) to another (target AN), the anchoring node that connects the UE to the Data Network sends an End Marker to the source AN after it starts sending UE traffic towards the target AN. The target AN buffers the data until it receives the End Marker forwarded by the source AN. This is to preserve the order of packets during the handover between ANs. The anchoring node is referred to as User Plane Function (UPF) in 5G and it is a Network Function of the mobile network. The UPFs are traditionally centrally deployed but are more and more distributed closer to the edge. With distributed UPFs, handover becomes necessary among UPFs, and the End Marker mechanism may need to be extended to Data Network devices that are not mobile network functions. This document discusses the problem and proposes a solution based on ICMP messages if packet ordering needs to be preserved during handover between UPFs.</t>
