    <abstract>
      <t>In an SRv6 network, each SRv6 segment endpoint has at least one SRv6 locator. Through the SRv6 locator routes, other SRv6 segment nodes can steer traffic to that node. This document describes a method of advertising SRv6 locator to neighboring SRv6 Segment Endpoint nodes through IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol.</t>
