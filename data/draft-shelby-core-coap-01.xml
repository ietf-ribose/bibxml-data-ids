      <t>This document specifies the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP),a specialized transfer protocol for use with constrained networks andnodes for machine-to-machine applications such as smart energy andbuilding automation. These constrained nodes often have 8-bitmicrocontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while networkssuch as 6LoWPAN often have high packet error rates and typicalthroughput of 10s of kbps. CoAP provides request/reply andsubscribe/notify interaction models between appliciation end-points,supports built-in resource discovery, and includes key web conceptssuch as URIs and RESTful methods. CoAP easily translates to HTTP forintegration with the web while meeting specialized requirements suchas multicast support, very low overhead and simplicity forconstrained environments.</t>
