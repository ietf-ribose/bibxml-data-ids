      <t>Native Short Address (NSA [I-D.li-6lo-native-short-address]), proposes to algorithmically assign short addresses to nodes in a 6lo environment so to achieve stateless forwarding, hence, avoiding using a routing protocol. NSA is more suitable in case of stable and static wireline connectivity, in order to avoid renumbering due to topology changes. Even in such kind of scenarios, reliability remains an issue. This memo tackles specifically reliability in NSA deployments, analyzing possible broad solution categories to solve the issue.</t>
