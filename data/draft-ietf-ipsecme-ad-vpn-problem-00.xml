      <t>This document describes the problem of enabling a large number of systems to communicate directly using IPsec to protect the traffic between them. It then expands on the requirements, for such a solution. Manual configuration of all possible tunnels is too cumbersome in many such cases. In other cases the IP address of endpoints change or the endpoints may be behind NAT gateways, making static configuration impossible. The Auto Discovery VPN solution is chartered to address these requirements.</t>
