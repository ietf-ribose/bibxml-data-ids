      <t>This memo updates the TCP sender-side reaction to a congestion notification received via Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN). The updated method is less conservative than the TCP reaction in response to loss. The intention is to achieve good throughput when the queue at the bottleneck is smaller than the bandwidth-delay- product of the connection. This is more likely when an Active Queue Management (AQM) mechanism has ECN-marked a packet than when a packet was lost. Future versions of this document will discuss SCTP as well as other transports using ECN.</t>
