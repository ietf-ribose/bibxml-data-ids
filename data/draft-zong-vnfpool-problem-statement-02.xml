    <abstract>
      <t>There is a trend to implement network services by using a group of Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) called a VNF set. A VNF set can offer benefits like flexible service provisioning. A VNF set also introduces additional points of failure, and therefore poses additional challenges on reliability. This document overviews the problems related to the reliability of a VNF set. A VNF pooling architecture is also briefly introduced as candidate solution to address the problems.</t>
