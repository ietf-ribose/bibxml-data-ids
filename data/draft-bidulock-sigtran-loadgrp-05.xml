      <t>This Internet-Draft describes an extension parameter and procedure to the Signalling User Adaptation Protocols [IUA], [M2UA], [M3UA], [SUA], [DUA], [V5UA], [GR303UA], [ISUA], [TUA], based on the Stream Transmission Control Protocol (SCTP) [SCTP] which permits an Application Server Processes (ASP) to indicate its placement within a Load Group and permits an Signalling Gateway (SG) to distribute traffic over Load Groups under Application Server Process (ASP) control. The described procedure provides for Override, Load-share and Broadcast traffic mode operation within a Load Group consisting of one or more Application Server Processes (ASPs) resulting in a mixture of traffic modes within an Application Server (AS). The parameters and procedures described here supplement the UA Load Selection [LOADSEL] extension parameters and procedures for improved distribution of traffic over ASPs and Signalling Gateway Processes (SGPs).</t>
