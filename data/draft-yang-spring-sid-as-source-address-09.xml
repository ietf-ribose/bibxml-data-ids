    <abstract>
      <t>SRv6 is being rapidly deployed and is currently primarily used in trusted-domain backbone networks. Both the carrier market and the enterprise market are adopting SRv6 for end-to-end service delivery. However, if a firewall exists along an SRv6 path, legitimate SRv6 traffic will be dropped. This proposal addresses this issue by using SID as source address in SRv6 packets.</t>
