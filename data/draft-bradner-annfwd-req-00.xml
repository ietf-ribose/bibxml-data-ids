      <t>There are a number of situations in the Internet where it would beuseful to be able to have an application be able to send traffic to adestination without revealing the IP address of the destination tothe source, or the IP address of the source to the destination, orboth. One way to do this is to have a network resident set ofservers which can forward packets, with encryption and decryptionapplied to their source and destination addresses when appropriate.We will call this server an anonymizing forwarder.</t>
