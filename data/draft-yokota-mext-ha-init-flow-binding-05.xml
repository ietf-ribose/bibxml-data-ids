    <abstract>
      <t>There are scenarios in which the home agent needs to trigger flow binding operations towards the mobile node such as moving a flow from one access network to another based on the network resource availability. In order for the home agent to be able to initiate interactions for flow bindings with the mobile node, this document defines new signaling messages and sub-options for Mobile IPv6. Home agent initiated flow bindings are supported for both IPv4 and IPv6 enabled mobile nodes.</t>
