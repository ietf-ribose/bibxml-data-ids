    <abstract>
      <t>This draft introduces the new challenges for the network brought by massive access services under the background of the convergence of the cloud and the network which acquires the network to identify and convey the information of fine-grain user and application requirements, aiming to fulfill differentiated service provisioning and improve the comprehensive utilization of network resources. The draft raises the scope of current solution gap analysis and further proposes the definition of DB-ORS in which network capabilities are abstracted as atomic services and can be orchestrated by applications. Scenarios of cloud access and DCI are outlined to clarify the concepts and principles of DB-ORS in overcoming challenges.</t>
