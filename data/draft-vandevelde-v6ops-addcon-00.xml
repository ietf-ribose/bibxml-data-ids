      <t>One fundamental aspect of any IP communications infrastructure is its addressing plan. With its new address architecture and allocation policies, the introduction of IPv6 into a network means that network designers and operators need to reconsider their existing approaches to network addressing. Lack of guideliness on handling this aspect of network design could slow down the integration of IPv6. This draft aims to provide the information and recommendations relevant to planning the addressing aspects of IPv6 deployments. The draft also provides IPv6 addressing case studies for both an enterprise and an ISP network. In this first version of the draft we aim to provoke discussion on this important topic; more detailed case study texts will follow.</t>
