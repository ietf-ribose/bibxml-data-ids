      <t>The Internet Protocol, version 4 (IPv4) header includes a 16-bit Identification field in all packets, but this length is too small to ensure reassembly integrity even at moderate data rates in modern networks. Even for Internet Protocol, version 6 (IPv6), the 32-bit Identification field included when a Fragment Header is present may be smaller than desired for some applications. This specification addresses these limitations by specifying an IPv6 Hop-by-Hop option for Identification Extension; it further provides a messaging service for fragmentation and reassembly congestion management.</t>
