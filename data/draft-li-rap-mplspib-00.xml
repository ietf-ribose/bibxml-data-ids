      <t>This document specifies a set of policy rule classes (PRC) for configuring MPLS traffic engineering policy at network elements. Instances of these classes reside in a virtual information store called the MPLS-TE Policy Information Base (PIB). The COPS protocol [3] with extensions for provisioning [4] is used to transmit this policy information to network elements. The PRCs defined in this document are intended for use by the COPS-PR MPLS client type. These PRCs are in addition to any other PIBs that may be defined for the MPLS client type, as well as the PRCs defined in the Framework PIB [5].</t>
