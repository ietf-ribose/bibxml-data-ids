      <t>Pre-congestion notification (PCN) provides information to supportadmission control and flow termination in order to protect theQuality of Service of inelastic flows. It does this by markingpackets when traffic load on a link is approaching or has exceeded athreshold below the physical link rate. This document specifies howsuch marks are to be encoded into the IP header. The baselineencoding described here provides for only two PCN encoding states.Other documents describe extended encoding schemes that allow forthree encoding states.StatusThis memo is posted as an Internet-Draft with an intent to eventuallyprogress to standards track.</t>
