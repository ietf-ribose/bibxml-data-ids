      <t>TPA-label is a DNS-based prefix mechanism for DKIM policy records asa means to authorize Third-Party domains. This mechanism allowsfirst-party domains to autonomously authorize a range of third-partydomains in a scalable, individual DNS transaction. Thisauthorization extends the scope of DKIM policy assertions to supplantmore difficult to administer mechanisms. Alternatives forfacilitating third-party authorizations currently necessitate thecoordination between two or more domains by setting up selector/keyDNS records, DNS zone delegations, or the regular exchange of public/private keys.Checking DKIM policies may occur when a From header email-address isnot within the domain of a valid DKIM signature. When a Third-Partysignature is found, TPA-labels offer an efficient means for emailaddress domains to authorize specific third-party signing domains.The scope of the authorization may separately assert identityauthentication for From and Sender and Resent-* headers for email-addresses within the authorizing domain. Identity authentication canbe asserted by the scope of the authorization, even when signed by aThird-Party domain. In addition, the RFC2821.MailFrom domain canauthorize domains for controlling DSNs.</t>
