    <abstract>
      <t>Anecdotally, every IESG complains about the Area Director (AD) workload, and says that it takes the first full term to understand the job. Empirically, the AD workload is high sometimes causing backlogs in processing of Internet-Drafts and stressing the ADs. Empirically, the AD workload is high sometimes causing backlogs in processing of Internet-Drafts and stressing the ADs. This is evidenced by the limits applied to the number of pages on the regular IESG telechats, and by the number of documents waiting in excess of fifty days for initial AD review after a working group has requested publication. This document proposes a number of ways that the AD workload can be reduced. It will be up to the IETF consensus process to determine which proposals to adopt. A major goal of this effort is to make it feasible for a wider diversity of people to volunteer as candidates for AD possitions by reducing the barriers and costs to individuals and their employers.</t>
