      <t>This Internet-Draft describes an experimental protocol, MM-HOP, which was defined during the fall of 2000 and is currently being implemented by ABNW. Using MM-HOP fast, state-preserving handovers between pico-cell wireless base-stations carrying IP traffic may be achieved. This draft is NOT submitted to seamoby as candidate for any standard protocol, only as a record of a limited implementation of context transfer and micro-mobility support.</t>
