      <t>This Internet-Draft describes an experimental protocol, MM-HOP,which was defined during the fall of 2000 and is currently beingimplemented by ABNW. Using MM-HOP fast, state-preserving handoversbetween pico-cell wireless base-stations carrying IP traffic may beachieved. This draft is NOT submitted to seamoby as candidate forany standard protocol, only as a record of a limited implementationof context transfer and micro-mobility support.</t>
