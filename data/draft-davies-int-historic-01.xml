      <t>The document marks as historic any "int" domain names that were designated for infrastructure purposes, and identifies them for removal from the "int" top-level domain. Any implementation that involves these domains should be considered deprecated. This document also updates [RFC1591] by removing the documented use of "int" for international databases.</t>
