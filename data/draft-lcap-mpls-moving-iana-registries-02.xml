      <t>RFC 5586 generalized the applicability of the pseudowire Associated Channel Header (PW-ACH) into the Generic Associated Channel G-Ach. However, registries and allocations of G-ACh parameters had been distributed throughout different, sometimes unrelated, registries. This document coalesces these into a new "Generic Associated Channel (G-ACh)" registry under the "Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture (MPLS)" heading. This is an update to RFC 5586 [RFC5586]. This document also updates RFC 6374, RFC 6428, RFC 6378, RFC 6427, RFC-ietf-mpls-gach-adv-08, and RFC-ietf-mpls-tp-ethernet-addressing-08.</t>
