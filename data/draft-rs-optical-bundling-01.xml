    <abstract>
      <t>In an optical mesh network, two adjacent optical cross connects (OXCs) may have multiple, parallel, discrete bandwidth links connecting them [1]. When a link state routing protocol is used, these links may all be bundled together and advertised in a single link state advertisement (LSA). This draft describes the requirements, and proposes a method for bundling optical links. The proposed method aims to reduce the number of routing adjacencies between neighboring nodes, and works in conjunction with a link management protocol (e.g., LMP [2]). The discussion in this draft is related specifically to OSPF.</t>
