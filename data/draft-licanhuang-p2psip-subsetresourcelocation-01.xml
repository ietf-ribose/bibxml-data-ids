      <t>This file is a proposal for location and discovery of filter resources selected by search-conditions. The peers,which are virtually grouped,construct n-tuple overlay virtual hierarchical tree overlay network.With cached addresses of peers, the overload of traffic in treestructure can be avoided. The resources are classified into hierarchicaldomains, and registered into the peers which are located in the samedomain virtual groups as the resources'. This proposal supportsflexible queries by a SQL-like query statement.</t>
