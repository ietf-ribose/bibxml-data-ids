    <abstract>
      <t>Key exchange without forward secrecy enables pervasive monitoring. Massive pervasive monitoring attacks relying on key exchange without forward secrecy have been reported, and many more have likely happened without ever being reported. If key exchange without Diffie-Hellman is used, access to long-term keys enable passive attackers to compromise past and future sessions. Entities can get access to long-term key material in different ways: physical attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks, espionage, or by simply demanding access to keying material with or without a court order. Session Description Protocol (SDP) Security Descriptions (RFC 4568) does not offer PFS and has a large number of additional significant security weaknesses. This document specifies that use of the SDP Security Descriptions is NOT RECOMMENDED. New deployments SHOULD forbid support of SDP Security Descriptions. This document reclassifies RFC 4568 (SDP Security Descriptions) to Historic Status and also obsoletes RFC 4568. This document updates RFC 7201 (Options for Securing RTP Sessions) to note that SDP Security Descriptions SHOULD NOT be used.</t>
