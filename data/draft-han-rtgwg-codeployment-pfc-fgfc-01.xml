    <abstract>
      <t>The demand for lossless network transmission and the application of flow control mechanisms have expanded from DCNs (Data Center Networks) to WANs(Wide Area Networks). To mitigate PFC - related issues in WANs, the fine - grained flow control is proposed. This mechanism aims to achieve precise control at flow / tenant levels, limits flow control to specified paths and slices, and provides intelligent congestion backpressure. As current DCN already adopts PFC mechanisms, the fine-grained flow control in WANs needs to work with PFC in DCNs to achieve end-to-end flow control.</t>
