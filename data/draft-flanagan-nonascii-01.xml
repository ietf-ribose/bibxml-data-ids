      <t>In order to support the internationalization of protocols and a more diverse Internet community, the RFC Series must evolve to allow for the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs. While English remains the accepted language of the Series, the encoding of future RFCs will be in UTF-8. This document describes the RFC Editor requirements and guidance regarding the use of non-ASCII characters in RFCs. This document updates [draft-iab-styleguide]. Please review the PDF version of this draft.</t>
