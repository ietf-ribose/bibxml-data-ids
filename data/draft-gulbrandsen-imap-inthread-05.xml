      <t>The SEARCH=INTHREAD extension extends the IMAP SEARCH command to operate on threads as well as individual messages. Other commands which search are implicitly extended. The THREAD=REFS extension provides a threading algorithm using (almost) only the References header field for use with the IMAP THREAD command.</t>
