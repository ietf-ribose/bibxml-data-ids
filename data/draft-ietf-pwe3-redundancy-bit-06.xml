      <t>This document describes a mechanism for standby status signaling of redundant pseudowires (PWs) between their termination points. A set of redundant PWs is configured between provider edge (PE) nodes in single-segment pseudowire (SS-PW) applications, or between terminating provider edge (T-PE) nodes in multi-segment pseudowire (MS-PW) applications. In order for the PE/T-PE nodes to indicate the preferred PW to use for forwarding PW packets to one another, a new status bit is needed to indicate a preferential forwarding status of Active or Standby for each PW in a redundant set. In addition, a second status bit is defined to allow peer PE nodes to coordinate a switchover operation of the PW.</t>
