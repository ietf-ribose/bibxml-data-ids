      <t>Seamless offering of Quality of Service (QoS) to a Mobile Node duringhandovers is considered crucial for enabling a variety of applicationservices in the Mobile Internet. In this document, we define the QoScontexts and show how they could be transferred to enable seamless QoSoperation during handovers. We introduce the notion of QoS ProfileTypes and the associated QoS Profiles, which together constitute QoScontexts, that facilitate QoS inter-operability among the pariticipatingaccess routers. We also illustrate how these contexts can be used withfast handover signaling.</t>
