      <t>Seamless offering of Quality of Service (QoS) to a Mobile Node during handovers is considered crucial for enabling a variety of application services in the Mobile Internet. In this document, we define the QoS contexts and show how they could be transferred to enable seamless QoS operation during handovers. We introduce the notion of QoS Profile Types and the associated QoS Profiles, which together constitute QoS contexts, that facilitate QoS inter-operability among the pariticipating access routers. We also illustrate how these contexts can be used with fast handover signaling.</t>
