    <abstract>
      <t>MRM facilitates automated fault detection and fault isolation in a large multicast routing infrastructure. It is designed to alarm a network administrator of multicast reachability problems in close to real-time. There are two basic types of components in MRM, MRM manager and MRM testers. This document specifies the protocol with which the two MRM components communicate, the types of operations the testers perform, and information an MRM manager can obtain.</t>
