      <t>The IETF TRILL protocol provides optimal pair-wise data forwardingwithout configuration, safe forwarding even during periods oftemporary loops, and support for multipathing of both unicast andmulticast traffic. TRILL accomplishes this by using IS-IS link staterouting and by encapsulating traffic using a header that includes ahop count. Devices that implement TRILL are called RBridges.TRILL supports multi-access LAN links that can have multiple endstations and RBridges attached. Where multiple RBridges are attachedto a link, native traffic to and from end stations on that link ishandled by a subset of those RBridges called Appointed Forwarders,with the intent that native traffic in each VLAN be handled by atmost one RBridge. The purpose of this document is to improve thedocumentation of the Appointed Forwarder mechanism.</t>
