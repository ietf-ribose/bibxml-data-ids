    <abstract>
      <t>Ad Hoc networks often present a challenging environment for IPv6 addressing due to the indeterminant neighborhood properties of their interfaces. IPv6 nodes must assign IPv6 addresses to their interface connections to Ad Hoc networks that are locally unique but must not be propagated to other networks. IPv6 nodes must therefore be able to assign self-generated addresses to their interfaces when there are no IPv6 Internetworking routers present that can coordinate topologically-oriented IPv6 addresses or prefixes. This document calls for an IPv6 address type that a node can autonomously assign to its Ad Hoc network interfaces.</t>
