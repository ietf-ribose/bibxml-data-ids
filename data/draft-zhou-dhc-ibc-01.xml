      <t>This document provides security methods based on identity based cryptography to protect DHCP messages. Identity based cryptography is a special kind of public key cryptography. Specifically, an authetication protocol based on IBS (identity based signature) algorithms is proposed. A key distribution method adopting IBE ( identity based encryption) algorithms is also proposed, where key is used as a shared secret in calculating authentication information according to authentication protocol specified in RFC 3315.</t>
