      <t>This document describes a network service model for service providers to deliver economical layer 2 VPN services using hierarchical MPLS. The service model builds on top of 2547 and BGP/MPLS and extends to building L2VPN services between customer sites with a scalable peering model. It reduces the cost of services for downstream providers by using a distance-insensitive IP Network Service Provider (NSP) as a WAN partner to connect distant regions. It simplifies downstream providerâ€™s operation and improves the scalability of a traditional standard overlay model by allowing the downstream provider to peer with the upstream provider for both Internet transit and L2VPN services.</t>
