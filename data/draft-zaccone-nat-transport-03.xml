      <t>This document describes some mechanisms to enable an IP network to transport both the IP traffic of the local realm and the IP traffics of external realms in the native (non-tunneled) way [TRANSP-FRAM]. The methods, described in this document, provide to the routers of the operated network the necessary information enabling the delivery of IP traffics originated from the foreign realms the operator offer connectivity to. This information is derived by the currently available routing information routers have and is moreover provided to them by the mean of a local delivery mechanism.</t>
