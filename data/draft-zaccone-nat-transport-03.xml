      <t>This document describes some mechanisms to enable an IP network totransport both the IP traffic of the local realm and the IP trafficsof external realms in the native (non-tunneled) way [TRANSP-FRAM].The methods, described in this document, provide to the routers ofthe operated network the necessary information enabling the deliveryof IP traffics originated from the foreign realms the operator offerconnectivity to. This information is derived by the currentlyavailable routing information routers have and is moreover providedto them by the mean of a local delivery mechanism.</t>
