      <t>This document describes a deployment pattern for reducing overhead in multipart/form-data requests that include both file uploads and numerous text parameters. The approach consolidates multiple text fields into one or more application/x-www-form-urlencoded parts inside the multipart body. This technique requires no changes to existing HTTP, MIME, or form specifications and is fully compatible with RFC 7578. It uses only existing, standardized Content-Type values in their already-defined manner, making it immediately deployable with current infrastructure. The pattern guarantees backward compatibility: servers that don't recognize it still receive all parameters as standard form data. RFC 7578 defines multipart/form-data but does not specify optimization strategies; this document fills that gap. This document records the pattern, processing rules, and deployment considerations, and reports implementation experience from production systems processing millions of uploads daily.</t>
