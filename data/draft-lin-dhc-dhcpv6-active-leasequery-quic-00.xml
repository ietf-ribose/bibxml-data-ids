    <abstract>
      <t>RFC7653 allows for actively transferring the real-time binding information data of Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) via TCP, which satisfies the need of continuous update of an external requestor with Leasequery data. QUIC could provide useful, reliable and secure semantics for transferring active leasequery of DHCPv6, which enabling much better efficiency and performance by reducing connect time. This document describes how to use the QUIC transport protocol to deliver DHCPv6 Active Leasequery messages, named DHCP6oQUIC.</t>
