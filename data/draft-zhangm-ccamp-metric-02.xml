    <abstract>
      <t>As one of the requirements of link state based routing protocols such as OSPF, link state update packets are intervally or reactively disseminate in the network in order to keep the information of topology and links resource synchronized at each control node. Considering large scale networks, massive messages are flooded in the control plane of General Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) based multi-area networks. The convergence time of link state based routing protocols will have a significant impact on the performance of the networks. So measuring and analyzing the convergence time of information flooding in multi-areas becomes very important. This document provides suggestions for measuring OSPF multi-area control plane convergence. A performance metric of convergence time of information flooding is proposed to characterize the ability of information synchronization in multi-area networks.</t>
