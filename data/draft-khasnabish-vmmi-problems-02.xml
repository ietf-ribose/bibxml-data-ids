      <t>In this draft, we discuss the challenges and requirements related to migration, mobility, and interconnection of Virtual Machines (VMs)and Virtual Network Elements (VNEs). VM migration scheme across IP subnets is needed to implement virtual computing resources sharing across multiple network administrative domains. For the seamless online migration in various scenarios, many problems are needed to be resolved on the control plane. The VM migration process should be adapted to these aspects. We also describe the limitations of various types of virtual local area networking (VLAN) and virtual private networking (VPN) techniques that are traditionally expected to support such migration, mobility, and interconnections.</t>
