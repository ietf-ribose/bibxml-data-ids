      <t>This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. In particular, it describes objects for configuring aspects of the Neighborhood Discovery Protocol (NHDP) process on a router. The NHDP MIB also reports state information, performance information and notifications. This additional state and performance information is useful to management stations troubleshooting neighbor discovery problems.</t>
