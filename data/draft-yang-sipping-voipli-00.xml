      <t>Recently broadband Voice over IP (VoIP) has a clear trend to substitute for traditional telephone services such as wire telephone, wireless telephone and mobile telephone service, it has become increasingly clear that VoIP services will be expected to provide Lawful Intercept to the same level experienced in the Public Switched Telephone Network(PSTN)[7]. In an effort to provide lawful interception for broadband VoIP, an architecture using session border controller was proposed, and a prototype implementation of the broadband VoIP lawful interception was created and basic performance evaluation was conducted on this prototype system. This document reports on the prototype implementation and the test results.</t>
