    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the architecture solutions for BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) with virtual Provider Edge (vPE) routers. It provides a functional description of the vPE control plane, the data plane, and the provisioning management process. The vPE solutions supports both Software Defined Networking (SDN) approach by allowing physical decoupling of the control and the forwarding plane of a vPE, as well as a distributed routing approach. These solutions allow vPE to be co-resident with the application virtual machines (VMs) on a single end device, such as a server, as well as on a Top-of-Rack switch (ToR), or in any network or compute device. The ability to provide end-to-end native BGP IP VPN connections between a Data Center (DC) (and/or other types of service network) applications and the Enterprise IP VPN sites is highly desirable to both Service Providers and Enterprises.</t>
