    <abstract>
      <t>When a sensor node roams within a very large and distributed wirelesssensor network, which consists of numerous sensor nodes, its routingpath and neighborhood keep changing. In order to provide a highlevel of security in this environment, the moving sensor node needsto be authenticated to new neighboring nodes as well as to establisha key for secure communication. The document proposes an efficientand scalable protocol to establish and update the secure key in adynamic wireless sensor network environment. The protocol guaranteesthat two sensor nodes share at least one key with probability 1(100%) with less memory and energy cost, while not causingconsiderable communication overhead.</t>
