      <t>This memo defines a simple mechanism, termed gateway response protocol (GRP), which permits hosts using Zero Configuration IPv4 Addresses [1] to find and use a default gateway, thereby gaining access to outside networks, including the Internet. GRP is fully compliant with rules limiting Zero Configuration addresses to local networks and does not negate source/destination address assumptions.</t>
