      <t>A new type of key is defined to address the problems of performance in large delegeted zones and issues of liability of registrars with regards to the storing of public keys belonging to zone cuts. This new key type also brings DNSSEC more in line with the DNS treatment of zone cuts and speeds recovery in handling key exposure. The new type of key is a referral record that is stored, signed, at the parent zone's place for the delegation point. A resolver receiving this record is being informed that there are genuine public keys at the child's authoritative name servers. The parent no longer needs to store the child's public keys locally.</t>
