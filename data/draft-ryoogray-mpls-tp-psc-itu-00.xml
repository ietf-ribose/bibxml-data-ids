    <abstract>
      <t>This document contains the updates to [RFC6378], "MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection", in an effort to satisfy the ITU-T's protection switching requirements. The following capabilities are required by ITU-T and described in this documents: priority modification, modification of non-revertive behavior, support of Manual Switch to Working (MS-W) command, support of protection against Signal Degrade (SD), and support of Exercise command. The behavior described in [RFC6378] are modified in order to preserve the network operation behavior to which network operators have become accustomed. This document introduces capabilities and modes to PSC. A capability is an individual behavior, and a node's set of capabilities are signalled using the method given in this document. A mode is a particular combination of capabilities. This document describes the behavior of the Protection State Coordination (PSC) protocol including priority logic and state machine when all of the aforementioned capabilities are enabled.</t>
