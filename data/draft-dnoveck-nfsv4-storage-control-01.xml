      <t>Developments in storage systems have made it important for applications to have control over the characteristics of the storage that will be used for their particular files. The development of pNFS has added to the usefulness of such control mechanisms as it has created the opportunity for the hierarchical organization of file names to be separated from the control of storage characteristics for individual files, including the assignment to storage locations to reflect the performance or other needs of those specific files. This document proposes extensions to NFS version 4 to allow storage requirements to be communicated to the NFS version 4 server.</t>
