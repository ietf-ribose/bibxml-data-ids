      <t>Developments in storage systems have made it important forapplications to have control over the characteristics of the storagethat will be used for their particular files. The development ofpNFS has added to the usefulness of such control mechanisms as it hascreated the opportunity for the hierarchical organization of filenames to be separated from the control of storage characteristics forindividual files, including the assignment to storage locations toreflect the performance or other needs of those specific files. Thisdocument proposes extensions to NFS version 4 to allow storagerequirements to be communicated to the NFS version 4 server.</t>
