      <t>The Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP) is used in conjunction with the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) in to provide a variety of short-term and long-term reception statistics. The available reporting may include aggregate information across longer periods of time as well as individual packet reporting. This document specifies a per-packet report metric capturing individual packets discarded from the jitter buffer after successful reception.</t>
