      <t>IEEE 802.15.4 networked solutions employing [RFC4944] for applications like Smart Grid Home Area Networking require unattended service discovery which can be supported with small, single packet (or few packet) exchanges. At the same time, it is desirable to mix wired devices into the same network so interoperation of service discovery between devices with differing operational characteristics is desired.</t>
