      <t>This document is a companion to the GMPLS extensions to control SONET/SDH networks as defined in [GMPLS-SONET-SDH], [GMPLS-SONET- SDH-EXT] and [GMPLS-SONET-SDH-RTG]. They define the SONET and SDH technology specific information needed when using GMPLS signaling. This informational memo details the GMPLS signalling and some routing specific considerations to control the interworking between SONET and SDH networks. It results from this, that interworking issues from the control plane viewpoint are well covered by the current definition of the Sonet/SDH extensions to the GMPLS protocol suite.</t>
