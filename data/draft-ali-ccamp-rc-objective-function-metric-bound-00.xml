      <t>There are scenarios where an ingress node requests remote node(s) to perform route computation or expansion. In such cases, there is a need for the ingress node to convey the required objective function for the path computation algorithm to the remote node performing route computation or expansion. Similarly, there is a need for the ingress node to indicate a TE metric bound for the loose segment expanded by the remote node(s). This document defines extensions to the RSVP-TE Protocol to allow an ingress node to request the required objective function for the path computation, as well as a metric bound to influence route computation decisions at a remote node(s).</t>
