      <t>This document describes the Multicast extension for the Optimized Link State Routing protocol(MOLSR). MOLSR is designed for mobile routers, and works in a heterogenous network composed of simple OLSR routers, MOLSR routers and hosts. In the last part of this document we introduce also a Wireless Internet Group Management Protocol (WIGMP). It offers the possibility for OLSR nodes (without multicast capabilities) to join multicast groups and receive multicast data.</t>
