    <abstract>
      <t>One of the protocol instantiations the RMT WG is chartered to create is a TRee-based ACKnowledgement protocol (TRACK). Rather than create a set of monolithic protocol specifications, the RMT WG has chosen to break the reliable multicast protocols into Building Blocks (BB) and Protocol Instantiations (PI). A Building Block is a specification of the algorithms of a single component, with an abstract interface to other BBs and PIs. A PI combines a set of BBs, adds in the additional required functionality not specified in any BB, and specifies the specific instantiation of the protocol.</t>
