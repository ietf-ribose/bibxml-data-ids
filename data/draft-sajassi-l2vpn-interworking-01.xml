      <t>The need to support L2VPN services with disparate Attachment Circuits (heterogeneous transport) is becoming as important as the support of L2VPN services with the same type of Attachment Circuits (homogenous transport). To support L2VPN services with heterogeneous transport, some means of interworking is needed. The requirement to support L2VPN interworking is stated in [PPVPN-L2FRWK]. This document describes different approaches and mechanisms that can be used to provide L2VPN interworking among disparate interfaces.</t>
