      <t>The Next Steps in Signaling working group is developing a protocol suite for signaling information about a data flow along its path in the network. The lower layer in the protocol suite, the NSIS Transport Layer Protocol (NTLP) is intended to provide a generally useful transport service for such signaling messages. There is a long-running open question about how much (if at all) the NTLP should provide reliable message transport. There is a large amount of confusion about what this question even means, let alone how to answer it. This document identifies the possible reliability requirements for signaling protocols in general, based on past evaluations of RSVP and research in soft-state protocol performance. It makes a proposal for what kind of reliable transport functionality should be supported in the NTLP, and discusses some of the resulting impacts and constraints on the NTLP design.</t>
