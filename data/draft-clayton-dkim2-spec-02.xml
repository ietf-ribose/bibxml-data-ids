    <abstract>
      <t>DomainKeys Identified Mail v2 (DKIM2) permits a person, role, or organization that owns a signing domain to document that it has handled an email message by associating their domain with the message. This is achieved by applying a cryptographic signature to the message. Verification is performed by querying an entry within the signing domain's DNS space to retrieve an appropriate public key. As a message is transferred from author to recipient further signatures will be added to provide a validatable "chain". This permits validators to identify when messages have been unexpectedly "replayed" and can ensure that delivery status notifications are only sent to entities that were involved in the transmission of a message.</t>
