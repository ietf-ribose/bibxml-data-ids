      <t>This memo defines a Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) [3] Application for domain name based discovery of application services. Essentially, this uses DNS NAPTR resource records [4] to provide one more layer of redirection for service lookup than is feasible with SRV ([2]) records. It is proposed because real-life use is demonstrating a need for something slightly more substantial than SRV, and alternatively SRV usage may become twisted out of its intended shape.</t>
