      <t>This memo defines a Dynamic Delegation Discovery System (DDDS) [3]Application for domain name based discovery of application services.Essentially, this uses DNS NAPTR resource records [4] to provide onemore layer of redirection for service lookup than is feasible withSRV ([2]) records. It is proposed because real-life use isdemonstrating a need for something slightly more substantial thanSRV, and alternatively SRV usage may become twisted out of itsintended shape.</t>
