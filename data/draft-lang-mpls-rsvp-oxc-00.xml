      <t>Dynamically provisionable optical crossconnects (OXCs) will play an active role in future optical networks and the MPL(ambda)S control plane will be used to establish, teardown, and reroute optical trails through the network. This document specifies extensions to RSVP to address some of the unique requirements of such optical trails. Specifically, we propose extensions to RSVP that allow an upstream node to make a Label suggestion to a downstream node when establishing an optical trail and allow both directions of a bi- directional optical trail to be established simultaneously. A new message type is also defined so that an RSVP node can notify (possibly non-adjacent) RSVP nodes when network failures occur, without affecting the RSVP states of intermediate RSVP nodes. Finally, we propose a modification to allow bundle messages to be sent to non-adjacent RSVP nodes.</t>
