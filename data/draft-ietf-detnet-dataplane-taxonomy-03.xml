      <t>This draft is to facilitate the understanding of the data plane enhancement solutions, which are suggested currently or can be suggested in the future, for deterministic networking. This draft provides criteria for classifying data plane solutions. Examples of each category are listed, along with reasons where necessary. Strengths and limitations of the categories are described. Suitability of the solutions for various services of deterministic networking are also mentioned. Reference topologies for evaluation of the solutions are given as well.</t>
