      <t>We consider access technology agnostic applications that use IP levelQoS primitives to specify their QoS requirements. In future wirelesssystems (beyond what is often referred to as 3G), where mobile nodesmay access an IP backbone over diverse access networks, the IP levelQoS primitives are not only used to specify the requested IP levelservice, but also (through an access specific translation function)to help the mobile node's wireless link manager to configure thewireless bearer service. In such a scenario, the IP level QoSprimitives must meet special requirements in order to support thespectrum efficient management of the wireless resources.</t>
