      <t>We consider access technology agnostic applications that use IP level QoS primitives to specify their QoS requirements. In future wireless systems (beyond what is often referred to as 3G), where mobile nodes may access an IP backbone over diverse access networks, the IP level QoS primitives are not only used to specify the requested IP level service, but also (through an access specific translation function) to help the mobile node's wireless link manager to configure the wireless bearer service. In such a scenario, the IP level QoS primitives must meet special requirements in order to support the spectrum efficient management of the wireless resources.</t>
