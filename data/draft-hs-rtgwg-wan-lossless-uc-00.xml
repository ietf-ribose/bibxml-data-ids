    <abstract>
      <t>This document outlines the use cases and requirements for implementing lossless data transmission techniques in Wide Area Networks (WANs), motivated by the increasing demand for high- bandwidth and reliable data transport in applications such as high- performance computing (HPC), genetic sequencing, multimedia content production and distributed training. The challenges associated with existing data transport protocols in WAN environments are discussed, along with the proposal of requirements for enhancing lossless transmission capabilities to support emerging data-intensive applications.</t>
