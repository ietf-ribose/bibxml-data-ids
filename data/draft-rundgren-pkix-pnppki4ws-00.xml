      <t>'Web Services' [2, 3] is the collective name of a set of emerging technologies targeted for ultimately supporting Plug-and-Play (PnP) integration of business- and information-systems, within and between organizations. This specification covers an X.509 certificate extension, designed to enable PnP-support for the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) part of a Web Service. In addition to supporting Web Services, the extension is also intended to be useable for general-purpose PKI-enabled applications. A PowerPoint presentation highlighting the core of this specification is also available [4]</t>
