      <t>Operational procedures and protocols of today's communicationnetworks typically use explicitly defined mechanisms andrepresentations to reach the goals associated to their design. Thispractice results into numerous protocols having a restricted spacefor (self-)adaptability, flexibility, and sensitivity respective totheir network context (e.g. network traffic conditions, failureconditions, etc). On the other hand, a wide spectrum of learning andoptimization techniques is available such that networks could learnand optimize their behavior in the running context. This documentdescribes the opportunities and challenges for a Learning CapableCommunication Network (LCCN).</t>
