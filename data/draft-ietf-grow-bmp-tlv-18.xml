    <abstract>
      <t>Most of the BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) message types make provision for data in Type, Length, Value (TLV) format. However, Route Monitoring messages (which provide a snapshot of the monitored Routing Information Base) and Peer Down messages (which indicate that a peering session was terminated) do not. Supporting (optional) data in TLV format across all BMP message types provides consistent and extensible structures that would be useful among the various use- cases where conveying additional data to a monitoring station is required. This document updates RFC 7854 [RFC7854] to support TLV data in all message types.</t>
