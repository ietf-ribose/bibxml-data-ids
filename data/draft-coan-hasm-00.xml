      <t>The HASM system addresses some of the current limitations ofend-to-end secure multicast. Specifically, the techniques used inHASM can achieve: (1) multiple autonomous administrative units, eachwith its own locally-managed authentication and authorization server,(2) efficiency in rekeying portions of a multicast group by usingnetwork elements to translate between keys (all without trusting anysingle network element to securely manage message text in the clear),and (3) defense against denial-of-service attacks by using a secureextension of IGMP. The HASM system makes use of (1) network support,including extensions to the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP),extended firewall functionality, and router support for encryption anddecryption and (2) host operating system support, specificallyextensions to IGMP.</t>
