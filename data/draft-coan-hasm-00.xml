      <t>The HASM system addresses some of the current limitations of end-to-end secure multicast. Specifically, the techniques used in HASM can achieve: (1) multiple autonomous administrative units, each with its own locally-managed authentication and authorization server, (2) efficiency in rekeying portions of a multicast group by using network elements to translate between keys (all without trusting any single network element to securely manage message text in the clear), and (3) defense against denial-of-service attacks by using a secure extension of IGMP. The HASM system makes use of (1) network support, including extensions to the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), extended firewall functionality, and router support for encryption and decryption and (2) host operating system support, specifically extensions to IGMP.</t>
