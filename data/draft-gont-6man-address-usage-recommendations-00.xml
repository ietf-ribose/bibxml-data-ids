      <t>IPv6 hosts typically configure and use a number of addresses of different scope and stability properties. Recent work has analyzed the security and privacy implications of IPv6 addressing, and improved the security and privacy properties of some of the aforementioned address types. However, advice is still missing guidance regarding which address properties are desirable in different scenarios, and how such addresses should be used when they are configured. This document complements the aforementioned work by providing advice regarding which address types to configure and how to employ them in a number of popular scenarios.</t>
