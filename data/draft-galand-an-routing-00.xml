      <t>This memo documents a way to include information on active routers capabilities in routing protocols. In this document, a special focus will be put on OSPF protocol release 2 [2], meanwhile other routing protocols might be considered. These information on active routers transferred through routing protocols will help active routers to exploit as better as possible the abilities of other active routers. This draft especially focus on OSPF protocol v2 and describes the corresponding opaque LSA complements according to the RFC 2370 [3].</t>
