    <abstract>
      <t>Considering computing and networking is quite different in terms of resource granularity as well as their status stability, a hierarchical segment routing is proposed and introduced as an end-to- end CATS process. However, it brings about potential problems as illustrated in [I-D.yuan-cats-end-to-end-problem-requirement]. In order to solve the mentioned problems and to improve and perfect a hierarchical solution, corresponding aggregation methods are discussed and hierarchical entries are proposed in this draft.</t>
