    <abstract>
      <t>The DRIP Entity Tag (DET) public Key Infrastructure (DKI) is a specific variant of classic Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) where the organization is around the DET, in place of X.520 Distinguished Names. Further, the DKI uses DRIP Endorsements in place of X.509 certificates for establishing trust within the DKI. There are two X.509 profiles for shadow PKI behind the DKI, with many of their X.509 fields mirroring content in the DRIP Endorsements. These PKIs can at times be used where X.509 is expected and non- constrained communication links are available that can handle their larger size. It is recommended that a DRIP deployment implement both of these along side the Endorsement trees. C509 (CBOR) encoding of all X.509 certificates are also provided as an alternative for where there are gains in reduced object size.</t>
