      <t>This document is written to help coordinate work on pre-congestionnotification (PCN) between the IETF PCN Working Group and the ITU-T.It maps the use of PCN into the ITU-T transport control architecture.It examines three scenarios, showing in each, where new requirementsare placed on the ITU-T architecture. In each case, the ITU-Tfunctional entity known as the Transport Resource Control FunctionalEntity (TRC-FE) is seen as the logical destination for PCN congestionreports and PCN flow termination reports, which it uses to keep trackof network status. As logical entities, instances of the TRC-FE canbe present in the ingress nodes, in one or more centralized devices,or in both. These alternatives define the scenarios examined.</t>
