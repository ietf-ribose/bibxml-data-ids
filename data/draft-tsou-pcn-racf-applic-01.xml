      <t>This document is written to help coordinate work on pre-congestion notification (PCN) between the IETF PCN Working Group and the ITU-T. It maps the use of PCN into the ITU-T transport control architecture. It examines three scenarios, showing in each, where new requirements are placed on the ITU-T architecture. In each case, the ITU-T functional entity known as the Transport Resource Control Functional Entity (TRC-FE) is seen as the logical destination for PCN congestion reports and PCN flow termination reports, which it uses to keep track of network status. As logical entities, instances of the TRC-FE can be present in the ingress nodes, in one or more centralized devices, or in both. These alternatives define the scenarios examined.</t>
