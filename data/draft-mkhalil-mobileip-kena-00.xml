      <t>As deployment of global IP networks become more widespread, thereare several challenges that become apparent, one of the moreimportant ones being secure access from a users perspective. Basedon the users service requirements, secure access will have to besetup between a multitude of nodes in a distributed fashion. Thenature of these security requirements may well be real-time anddynamic in nature and MUST protect the confidentiality of the user.These requirements are clearly manifested in the mobility domain.This draft outlines a general purpose Key Exchange framework forNetwork Architectures [KENA] with centralised key generation andmanagement tailored for distributed nodes. The draft also describesa specific implementation of KENA in the IP mobility domain byextending Mobile IP [Perkins96].</t>
