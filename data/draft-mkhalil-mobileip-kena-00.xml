      <t>As deployment of global IP networks become more widespread, there are several challenges that become apparent, one of the more important ones being secure access from a users perspective. Based on the users service requirements, secure access will have to be setup between a multitude of nodes in a distributed fashion. The nature of these security requirements may well be real-time and dynamic in nature and MUST protect the confidentiality of the user. These requirements are clearly manifested in the mobility domain. This draft outlines a general purpose Key Exchange framework for Network Architectures [KENA] with centralised key generation and management tailored for distributed nodes. The draft also describes a specific implementation of KENA in the IP mobility domain by extending Mobile IP [Perkins96].</t>
