      <t>The purpose of this draft is to document how the Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) can be used to enable a secure layer 3-based Hybrid Cloud, which is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures that remain unique entities, but are bound together to enable data and application portability. It describes how LISP, in combination with IPsec, can be implemented on a virtualized router that is deployed on a public cloud and on the enterprise Data Center to enable cloud bursting, workload migration, rapid provision of new applications in the cloud and disaster recovery use cases. This draft covers how LISP allows virtual machines (VMs) to be moved to the cloud without requiring changes to the VMs IP and/or MAC-address.</t>
