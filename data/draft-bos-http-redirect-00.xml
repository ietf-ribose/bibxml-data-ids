      <t>The HTTP 1.1 specification describes how a server can answer arequest with a redirection, instructing the client to get theresource from a different URL. It doesn't explain what to do with anyfragment identifier that might have been on the original URL, andthis omission has resulted in different clients handling fragments indifferent ways. This draft gives rules towards a more consistenthandling by future HTTP clients.</t>
