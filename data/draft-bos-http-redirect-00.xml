      <t>The HTTP 1.1 specification describes how a server can answer a request with a redirection, instructing the client to get the resource from a different URL. It doesn't explain what to do with any fragment identifier that might have been on the original URL, and this omission has resulted in different clients handling fragments in different ways. This draft gives rules towards a more consistent handling by future HTTP clients.</t>
