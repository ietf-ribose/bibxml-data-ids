    <abstract>
      <t>Deterministic Networking (DetNet) provides a capability for the delivery of data flows with extremely low packet loss rates and bounded end-to-end delivery latency. The enabler to DetNet is a proper queue scheduling mechanism, such as timeslot based queueing and forwarding mechanism, which requires every router along the DetNet path to collect the basic timeslot mapping relationship between itself and its adjacent router. This document defines two Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) TLVs, to acquire the basic timeslot mapping relationship between the local router and its adjacent router.</t>
