    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a generic hybrid signature construction that achieves strong unforgeability under chosen-message attacks (SUF- CMA), provided that the second component (typically the post-quantum one) is SUF-CMA secure. The proposed hybrid construction differs from the current composite hybrid approach by binding the second (post-quantum) signature to the concatenation of the message and the first (traditional) signature. This approach ensures that hybrid signatures maintain SUF-CMA security even when the first component only provides EUF-CMA security. In addition to this general hybrid construction, this document also proposes a non-black-box variant specifically tailored for schemes built from the Fiat-Shamir paradigm. This variant is SUF-CMA secure as long as only one component is SUF-CMA secure.</t>
