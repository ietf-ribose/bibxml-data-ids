      <t>This document specifies Neighbor Discovery optimized for 6LoWPAN.The 6LoWPAN format allows IPv6 to be used over very low-power, low-bandwidth wireless networks often making use of extended multihoptopologies. However, the use of standard IPv6 Neighbor Discoveryover 6LoWPAN networks has several problems. Standard NeighborDiscovery was not designed for wireless links, the standard IPv6 linkconcept and heavy use of multicast makes it inefficient. Thisdocument spefies a new mechanism allowing efficient Duplicate AddressDetection over entire 6LoWPAN networks. In addition it specifiesprefix and context dissemination for use with router advertisements,allows for stateless address assignment, and the use of NeighborDiscovery Proxy.</t>
