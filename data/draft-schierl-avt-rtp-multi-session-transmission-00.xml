      <t>In this draft, we discuss problems related to multi-session andmulti-source transmission using the Real-Time Transport Protocol(RTP). Most of the input to this draft is taken from emaildiscussion. Multi-session and multi-source transmission is motivatedby media data which allows for different transport layer treatment ofparts of the media. This is typically the case for layered media.Multi-session transmission is when media data from a single mediasource is split over multiple RTP sessions. Single-session multi-source transmission (from now on just called "multi-sourcetransmission") is when data from a single media source is sent asseveral RTP streams in the same RTP session. The main problemsdiscussed are the mechanisms used for data alignment and sourcecorrelation. This draft gives further an overview of payload formatsusing multi-sessions/multi-source transmission and highlights othertransport related issues. The draft concludes with recommendationsfor the discussed problems.</t>
