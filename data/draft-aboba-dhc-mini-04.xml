      <t>Today, with the rapid rise of home networking, there is a need for simple mechanisms of IPv4 address allocation and name resolution. This document describes the behavior of the mini-DHCP server, a small scale DHCP server that is typically implemented as part of a home gateway. As described in this document, the mini-DHCP server is capable of allocating addresses either in single or multi-segment networks. It supports dynamic DNS, and is capable of automatically detecting the presence of a full-fledged DHCP server, or other mini-DHCP servers, and shutting down as required.</t>
