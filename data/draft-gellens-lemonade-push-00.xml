      <t>This document describes an IMAP protocol extension allowing clients to submit new messages using IMAP. This is the so-called 'IMAP Push' approach currently being considered by the lemonade working group as one solution to the 'forward without download' problem (that is, as a means for clients to send new messages consisting of or containing all or parts of previously received messages without having to download and upload the data). This proposal relies on additional IMAP extensions, including CATENATE and Annotations. The IMAP extension described here requires that the message to be submitted be already composed and ready to go at the time of submission.</t>
