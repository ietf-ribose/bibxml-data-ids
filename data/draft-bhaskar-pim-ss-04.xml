      <t>Source-Specific PIM (PIM-SS) is a variant of PIM Sparse-Mode that onlybuilds source specific shortest path trees. These trees are builtdirectly on receiving group membership reports that request a givensource. PIM-SS precludes the building of shared trees, effectively par-titioning the different source trees from one another. For this reasonit is specifically suited for existing multicast applications for whichthere is expected and intended to be exactly one source.Source-Specific PIM can co-exist with PIM-SM. It uses a subset of PIM-SMmessages and lends itself to incremental deployment.</t>
