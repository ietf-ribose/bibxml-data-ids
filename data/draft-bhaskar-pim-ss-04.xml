      <t>Source-Specific PIM (PIM-SS) is a variant of PIM Sparse-Mode that only builds source specific shortest path trees. These trees are built directly on receiving group membership reports that request a given source. PIM-SS precludes the building of shared trees, effectively par- titioning the different source trees from one another. For this reason it is specifically suited for existing multicast applications for which there is expected and intended to be exactly one source. Source-Specific PIM can co-exist with PIM-SM. It uses a subset of PIM-SM messages and lends itself to incremental deployment.</t>
