      <t>A long long time ago Data Encryption Standard (DES) was standardized.Some 30 years later (2003) is was withdrawn as a standard by NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology (NIST), today 6 years later,its time for DES to finally die. By 2008 it was possible to bruteforce DES keys in 6.4 days using less than USD 10k worth of hardware.So by 2008 DES had passed its sell-by date. This document updatesRFC1964, RFC4120, and RFC4121 to deprecate the use of DES inKerberos. Because the version of Kerberos specified in RFC1510 onlysupports DES and has been replaced by RFC4120, RFC1510 isreclassified as historic.</t>
