    <abstract>
      <t>Part of the charter of the Protocol Design Group of the HTTP-NG project is to identify a set of formal interfaces that will allow the current functionality of the Web to be captured, as well as support future needs. Before delving into the specific interfaces, the kinds of concepts involved need to be described. The actual interface descriptions here are cast in terms of distributed object systems, the merits of which as a foundation for the Web have been discussed in 'Migrating the Web toward Distributed Objects' (ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/misc/webilu.html) and elsewhere. The intent is not to imply that what is presented here is complete or final, but rather to provide a starting point for how the Web should look in the future.</t>
