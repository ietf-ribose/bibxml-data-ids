      <t>Part of the charter of the Protocol Design Group of the HTTP-NG project is toidentify a set of formal interfaces that will allow the current functionality ofthe Web to be captured, as well as support future needs. Before delving into thespecific interfaces, the kinds of concepts involved need to be described. Theactual interface descriptions here are cast in terms of distributed objectsystems, the merits of which as a foundation for the Web have been discussed in'Migrating the Web toward Distributed Objects'(ftp://ftp.parc.xerox.com/pub/ilu/misc/webilu.html) and elsewhere. The intent isnot to imply that what is presented here is complete or final, but rather toprovide a starting point for how the Web should look in the future.</t>
