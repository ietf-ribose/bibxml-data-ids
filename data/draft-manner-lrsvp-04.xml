      <t>Guaranteed QoS for multimedia applications is based on reservedresources in each node on the end-to-end path. Even if thecorrespondent node does not support QoS, it would be useful to beable to reserve at least local resources at the access network,especially wireless link resources. Additionally, for mobile nodesthe continuity of QoS is disturbed due to end-to-end signalling orslow re-reservations of resources after each handover. This draftproposes a simple enhancement to RSVP, so that initial resourcereservations and re-reservations due to host mobility can be donelocally in an access network.</t>
