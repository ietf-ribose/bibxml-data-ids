      <t>This memo describes the architecture of end to end multihoming. End to end multihoming does not burden routing system for multihoming. That is, even extensive use of end to end multihoming does not increase the number of entries in a global routing table. Traditionally with IPv4, multihoming capability is offered by an intelligent routing system, which, as is always the case with violating the end to end principle, lacks scalability on a global routing table size and robustness against link failures. On the other hand, with end to end multihoming, multihoming is supported by transport (TCP) or application layer (UDP etc.) of end systems and does not introduce any problem in the network and works as long as there is some connectivity between the end systems. Because end to end multihoming is performed in end systems, the architecture needs no routing protocol changes Instead, APIs and applications must be modified to some extent.</t>
