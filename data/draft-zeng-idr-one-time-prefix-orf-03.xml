      <t>This document defines a new Outbound Router Filter (ORF) type for BGP, termed "One-time Address Prefix Outbound Route Filter", which would allow a BGP speaker to send to its BGP peer a route refresh request with a set of address-prefix-based filters to make the peer send only the specific routes matching the filters to the speaker. This ORF-type enables a BGP speaker to re-advertise some specific routes without the need of advertising the whole Adj-RIB-Out of a specific address family, which makes the route recovery and trouble shooting operation more efficient and also reduces the impact on network stability. This filter does not change the outbound route filters or policies on the BGP peer and should only be used for one- time route filtering.</t>
