      <t>Segment Routing (SR) leverages the source routing paradigm. SR is applicable to both Multiprotocol Label Switching (SR-MPLS) and IPv6 (SRv6) data planes. This document specifies procedure for sending and processing probe query and response messages for Performance Measurement (PM) in Segment Routing networks. The procedure uses the mechanisms defined in RFC 5357 (Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) Light) and Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP) for Delay Measurement, and also uses the extensions defined in this document for Loss Measurement. The procedure specified is applicable to SR-MPLS and SRv6 data planes and is used for both links and end- to-end SR Policies.</t>
