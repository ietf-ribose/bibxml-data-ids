    <abstract>
      <t>Ad Hoc networks often present a challenging environment for IPv6 addressing due to the undetermined neighborhood properties of their interfaces. IPv6 nodes assign IPv6 addresses to their Ad Hoc networks that must be locally unique. IPv6 nodes must therefore be able to assign topology-independent addresses when topology-oriented IPv6 address delegation services are either absent or only intermittently available. This document introduces a new IPv6 address type that a node can autonomously assign for each of its Ad- Hoc networks.</t>
