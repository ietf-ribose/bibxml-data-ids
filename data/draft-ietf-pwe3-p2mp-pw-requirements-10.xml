      <t>This document presents a set of requirements and a framework for providing a point-to-multipoint pseudowire (PW) over MPLS Packet Switched Networks. The requirements identified in this document are related to architecture, signaling, and maintenance aspects of point-to-multipoint PW operation. They are proposed as guidelines for the standardization of such mechanisms. Among other potential applications, point-to-multipoint PWs can be used to optimize the support of multicast Layer 2 services (Virtual Private LAN Service and Virtual Private Multicast Service).</t>
