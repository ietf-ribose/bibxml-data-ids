      <t>This document defines extensions to iCalendar and iTIP that allow the expression of imprecise and multiple alternative events in calendar objects and scheduling messages. Imprecise events can be used to imprecisely describe an event by specifying various ranked periods of time in which it could be scheduled. Alternative events can be used to describe an event in terms of multiple ranked event descriptions, imprecise or not, that could alternatively be scheduled.</t>
