      <t>RFC5837 describes a mechanism for Extending ICMP for Interface and Next-Hop Identification, which allows providing additional information in an ICMP error that helps identify interfaces participating in the path. This is especially useful in environments where each interface may not have a unique IP address to respond to, e.g., a traceroute. This document introduces a similar ICMP extension for Node identification. It allows providing a unique IP address or a textual name for the node, in the case where each node may not have a unique IP address (e.g., the IPv6 nexthop deployment case described in draft-chroboczek-intarea-v4-via-v6).</t>
