      <t>This draft defines a signaling mechanism based on RSVP-TE ([2]) tosupport an Optical User Network Interface (UNI). This effort is inpart driven by work in the OIF as well as the recent draft onsignaling requirements for the optical UNI ([3]), and is consistentwith recent work on Generalized MPLS (see [4], [5], [6], and [7]). The main function of this draft is to identify the relevant mechanismsin RSVP-TE (including further extensions) to satisfy functionalrequirements for an Optical UNI. This draft reflects ongoing work atthe Optical Interworking Forum (OIF), however, not all of theconcepts/requirements have been approved by the OIF.</t>
