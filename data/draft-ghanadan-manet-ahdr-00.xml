      <t>This document describes the Adaptive Hybrid Domain Routing (AHDR) protocol. It describes the parts of the protocol that are required of all implementations as well as optional requirements that each implementation may include. AHDR allows router nodes to form far- reaching ad-hoc networks, especially in wireless environments. AHDR uses a combination of proactive and reactive routing schemes to be responsive to topology changes without incurring high protocol overhead. AHDR adapts to network conditions in order to minimize network overhead and maximize network reachability.</t>
