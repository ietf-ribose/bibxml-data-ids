      <t>Today the Dual-Stack approach is the most straightforward and the most common way for introducing IPv6 into existing systems and networks. However a typical drawback of implementing Dual-Stack is that each node will still require at least one IPv4 address. Hence, solely deploying Dual-Stack does not provide a sufficient solution to the IPv4 address exhaustion problem. Assuming a situation where most of the IP communication (e.g. always-on, VoIP etc.) can be provided via IPv6, the usage of public IPv4 addresses can significantly be reduced and the unused public IPv4 addresses can under certain circumstances be returned to the public IPv4 address pool of the service provider. New Dual-Stack enabled services can be introduced without increasing the public IPv4 address demand, when IPv6 will be the preferred network layer protocol. This document describes such a solution in a Dual-Stack PPP session network scenario and explains the protocol mechanisms which are used.</t>
