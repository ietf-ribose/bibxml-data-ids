      <t>Lately, a few use-cases have been identified where, besides pathsetup, specific configuration of intermediate nodes is required forthe establishment of an LSP with its associated functions. Today,RSVP-TE is not supporting the selective configuration of intermediatenodes; hence extensions are required to equip RSVP-TE with such acapability. In this document we summarize the use-cases and theirrequirements and sketch alternative solutions to configureintermediate nodes. Since one of the main issues with intermediatenode configuration is the introduction of potential scaling problems,we included scalability in our analysis. This document does notspecify any extensions; its sole purpose is to foster discussion onthe subject.</t>
