      <t>This document describes the DIAMETER extension that is used for AAAin a PPP/SLIP Dial-Up and Terminal Server Access environment. Thisextension, combined with the base protocol, satisfies therequirements defined in the NASREQ AAA criteria specification and theROAMOPS AAA Criteria specification.Given that it is expected that initial deployments of the DIAMETERprotocol in a dial-up environment will include legacy systems, thisextension was carefully designed to ease the burden of servers thatmust perform protocol conversion between RADIUS and DIAMETER. Thisis achieved by re-using the RADIUS address space, eliminating theneed to perform attribute lookups.</t>
