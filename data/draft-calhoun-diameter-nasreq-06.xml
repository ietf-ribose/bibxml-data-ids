      <t>This document describes the DIAMETER extension that is used for AAA in a PPP/SLIP Dial-Up and Terminal Server Access environment. This extension, combined with the base protocol, satisfies the requirements defined in the NASREQ AAA criteria specification and the ROAMOPS AAA Criteria specification. Given that it is expected that initial deployments of the DIAMETER protocol in a dial-up environment will include legacy systems, this extension was carefully designed to ease the burden of servers that must perform protocol conversion between RADIUS and DIAMETER. This is achieved by re-using the RADIUS address space, eliminating the need to perform attribute lookups.</t>
