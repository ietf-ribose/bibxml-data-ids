    <abstract>
      <t>This draft consider an alternative PMTUD for QUIC. To discover the best PMTU, the passive probing approach is adopted. The process of discovering the best PMTU is not carried out separately, but is carried out simultaneously in the actual application data communication. A probe packet is defined newly using 1-RTT packet which includes actual application data as well as a short packet header and a PING_EXT frame. The PING_EXT frame is also defined newly. Until the best PMTU is discovered, the size of the probe packet is changed according to the size of the PMTU candidate. A simple discovery algorithm using only the PMTU candidate sequence with linear upward is described in this draft. Other rather complex discovery algorithms that consider various PMTU candidate sequences will be dealt with in the future.</t>
