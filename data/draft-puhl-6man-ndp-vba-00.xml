    <abstract>
      <t>Voucher-Based Addressing is an extensible IPv6 address generation and verification methodology for SLAAC-enabled local networks. Individual link-layer identifiers are bound to sets of deterministic output IP addresses. Neighbor Discovery Link Voucher options distributed with Router Advertisement or Redirect messages form a shared consensus between neighbors of the parameters used to auto- generate interface addresses. Cryptographic key derivation functions are used to generate pseudo-random addresses and to intentionally stretch address computation times. Host-selected parameters can be used to derive any number of both stable and ephemeral, privacy- focused addresses for each on-link prefix and at the link-local scope. Neighbors can then verify the link-layer-to-IP bindings during NDP address resolution processes to prevent active neighbor spoofing attacks in local networks.</t>
