      <t>Content splicing is a process that replaces the content of a main multimedia stream with other multimedia content, and delivers the substitutive multimedia content to the receivers for a period of time. The RTP mixer is designed to handle RTP splicing in [RFC6828], but how the RTP mixer knows when to start and end the splicing is still unspecified. This memo defines two RTP/RTCP extensions to indicate the splicing related information to the RTP mixer: an RTP header extension that conveys the information in-band and an RTCP packet that conveys the information out-of-band.</t>
