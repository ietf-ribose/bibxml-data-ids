      <t>The Network infrastructure Hiding Protocol (NHP) is a cryptography- based session-layer protocol designed to implement Zero Trust principles by rendering protected network resources invisible to unauthorized entities. By requiring authentication before connection and operating at OSI layers 5, NHP conceals IP addresses, ports, and domains from exposure to reconnaissance and automated exploitation, effectively reducing the attack surface. This draft defines the architecture, message format, and workflow of the NHP protocol, outlines its security objectives, and provides guidance for integration into modern network infrastructures and Zero Trust deployments.</t>
