      <t>The Internet Draft draft-ietf-ipatm-ipmc-05.txt ('Support for Multicast over UNI 3.1 based ATM Networks') describes a mechanism for handling IP multicast over ATM. In doing so it notes two different mechanisms for actually achieving the multicasting of packet traffic at the ATM level. These are meshes of point to multipoint VCs, or ATM level multicast servers. If a multicast server is in use a host or router may receive a transmitted packet back on the same interface it was originally sent on. It is necessary for IP hosts and routers to be able to distinguish and discard these packets which are reflected back. This memo describes the issue in greater detail, and suggests a range of new encapsulation options.</t>
