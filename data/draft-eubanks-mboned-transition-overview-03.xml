      <t>IPTV providers must serve content to their customers during the period of transition from IPv4 to IPv6. During this period, the content provider may support only one version of IP while the customer supports only the other. Likewise, the network between the provider and its customer may include segments supporting only one version of IP or another. This document provides an overview of the multicast transition problem. It also provides an overview of the solution space. The solution space is characterized by an adaptation function (AF) that provides an interface between IPv4 and IPv6 multicast domains.</t>
