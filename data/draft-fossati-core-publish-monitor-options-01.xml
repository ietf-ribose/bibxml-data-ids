      <t>This memo defines two additional Options for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) especially targeted at sleepy sensors: Publish and Monitor. The Publish Option enables opportunistic updates of a given resource state, by temporarily delegating the authority of the Publish'ed resource to a Proxy node. The whole process is driven by the (sleepy) origin -- which may actually never need to listen. The Monitor Option complements the typical Observe pattern, enabling the tracking of a resource hosted by a node sleeping most of the time, by taking care of establishing and maintaining an Observe relationship with the (sleepy) origin on behalf of the (sleepy) client.</t>
