      <t>As networks migrate towards IPv6, some entities still have the requirement for IPv4 configuration. DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 [RFC7341] provides a mechanism for obtaining IPv4 configuration information dynamically in IPv6 networks. DHCPv4/DHCPv6 Bulk Leasequery and Active Leasequery allow a client to get DHCP address binding information data in bulk transfer or in real-time via TCP. This document describes an extension of DHCPv6 Bulk and Active Leasequery that provides a mechanism to get DHCPv4 over DHCPv6 lease information.</t>
