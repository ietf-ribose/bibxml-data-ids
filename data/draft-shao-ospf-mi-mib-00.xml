      <t>The OSPF MIB defined by the IETF (RFC 1850) was designed to work withonly one OSPF process/instance on a given router.It currently doesn't offer a mechanism to access ospf mib obejects ofdifferent instances. For example, there is only a singleospfRouterId object, not a table of them.In order to handle multiple instances, RFC 4750 suggests that you useSNMPv3 contexts to provide per-instance views. This documentintroduces a way for OSPF MIB to support multiple instance, no materin SNMPv2 or SNMPv3 contexts, by adding the object ospfProcId intoevery OSPF MIB group. According to the specified ospfProcId, otherobejects in this OSPF instance can be accessed.</t>
