    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines requirements for standards specifications for energy management. The requirements defined in this document concern monitoring functions as well as control functions. In detail, the focus of the requirements is on the following features: identification of powered entities, monitoring of their power state, power inlets, power outlets, actual power, power properties, consumed energy, and contained batteries. Further requirements are included to enable control of powered entities' power supply and power state. This document does not specify the features that must be implemented by compliant implementations but rather features that must be supported by standards for energy management.</t>
