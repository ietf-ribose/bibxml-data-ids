      <t>This document specifies an improved version of INSIGNIA[1][2],which is a framework supporting quality of service(QOS) in mobile ad hoc networks. INSIGNIA is an in-band signaling system, and 'in-band signaling' means the control information is carried along with data in IP packets. In this memo we introduce network measurement into INSIGNIA, and then this system can highly responsive to changes of performance on mobile ad hoc networks.</t>
