      <t>The Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) working group has started looking into signaling for QoS in various cases. In this draft, we show the similarities and differences of signaling for QoS versus signaling for NAT and firewall traversal. It seams that there are quite a number of similarities, which might make sense to use a potential NSIS protocol for NAT and firewall traversal as well.</t>
