      <t>There needs to be a solution for locating and capturing data in a standardized way. Data may be cached, copied and/or stored at multiple locations in the network on route to its final destination. With an increasingly high volume of devices connecting to the Internet, support for network caching and replication is critical for continuous data availability. There are data repositories throughout a modern network and there needs to be a standardized way to locating the repositories and discovering the desired data within. There are several use cases which illustrate a need for a data discovery solution. An application might need to query the network to discover resources (program, service, resource) that can help the local application perform a particular task. Additionally, there could be volumes of data which needs to be searched and discovered in order to provide a result to be acted upon by the application. These are a couple of the use cases being addressed in this document.</t>
