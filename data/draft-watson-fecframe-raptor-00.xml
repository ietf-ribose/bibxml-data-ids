      <t>This document describes Fully-Specified Forward Error Correction(FEC) Schemes for the Raptor code and its application to reliabledelivery of media streams in the context of FEC Framework. TheRaptor code is a systematic code, where a number of repair symbolsare generated from a set of source symbols and sent in one or morerepair flows in addition to the source symbols that are sent to thereceiver(s) within a source flow. The Raptor code offers a close tooptimal protection against arbitrary packet losses at a lowcomputational complexity. Two FEC Schemes are defined, one forprotection of arbitrary packet flows and another for protection of asingle flow that already contains a sequence number. Repair data maybe sent over arbitrary datagram transport (e.g. UDP) or using RTP.An RTP Payload Type is defined for this latter case.</t>
