      <t>The Real Time Streaming Protocol, or RTSP, is an application-level protocol for control over the delivery of data with real-time properties. RTSP provides an extensible framework to enable controlled, on-demand delivery of real-time data, such as audio and video. Sources of data can include both live data feeds and stored clips. This protocol is intended to control multiple data delivery sessions, provide a means for choosing delivery channels such as UDP, multicast UDP and TCP, and delivery mechanisms based upon RTP (RFC 1889). RTSP uses the Session Control Protocol (SCP) (see appendix) to allow the use of a single TCP connection between the client and server for controlling delivery of one or more streams of data.</t>
