    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a mechanism, Peer-Mount, that allows YANG datastores to reference and incorporate information from remote datastores. This is accomplished by extending YANG with the ability to define mount points that reference data nodes in other YANG subtrees and subsequently allowing those data nodes to be accessed by client applications as if part of an alternative data hierarchy. In addition, means to manage and administer tho mount points are provided. This facilitates the development of applications that need to access network-wide data that treanscends individual network devices while ensuring network-wide data consistency. One example concerns example applications that require a network inventory and/or network topology with access to select management data within the nodes that comprise it. The concept of Peer-Mount was first introduced in an earlier Internet Draft that was no longer pursued due to lack of interest at the time. It is being revived now in light of renewed IETF interest in network inventory, network topology, and related use cases, for which Peer- Mount is of specific interest. Other concepts defined in the earlier draft, notably Alias-Mount, are not considered here since they provide other capabilities that are less applicable to those topics.</t>
