    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes manageable resources in ICN IoT deployments and a lightweight traffic classification method for mapping priorities to resources. Management methods are further derived for controlling latency and reliability of traffic flows in constrained environments. This work includes a distributed management of the heterogeneous resources (i) forwarding capacities, (ii) Pending Interest Table (PIT) space, and (iii) in-network data storage. By correlating these common ICN resources, performance measures can be optimized without sacrificing concurrent traffic demands. Different from the IP world, QoS in ICN can be benifical for all participants and manage 'quality instead of unfairness'.</t>
