      <t>This document suggests a possible process to address thestructural problems identified in the IETF Problem Statement asrequested in Version 02 of the IETF Problem Resolution draft.The process proposes that the IESG delegate responsibility forcoordinating, moderating and synthesising proposals for solutionsto parts of the structural problems to a Synthsis and Action Panel(SAP) selected through a variant of the nomcom selection process.The SAP should, if possible, deliver an integrated set ofproposals for changes derived from community input, bothunsolicited and, if necessary, solicited. The SAP would act as amoderator between authors of alternative propoasals in attemptingto achieve a proposal on which the community could agree. Theagreed plan be would be delivered to the IESG for final approval and action.</t>
