    <abstract>
      <t>Cloud Computing has been attracting a lot of attention from the networking industry. Some of the most publicized requirements are related to the evolution of the Cloud Networking Infrastructure to accommodate a large number of tenants, efficient network utilization, scalable loop avoidance, and Virtual Machine Mobility. This draft describes a framework for cloud networking, highlighting the applicability of existing work in various IETF Working Groups (e.g., RFCs and drafts developed in IETF L2VPN and L3VPN Working Groups) to cloud networking, and the gaps and problems that need to be further addressed. That is, the goal is to understand what may be re-used from the current protocols and call out requirements specific to the Cloud space that need to be addressed by new standardization work with proposed solutions in certain cases.</t>
