    <abstract>
      <t>Recent explosive growth of content delivery/distribution networks (CDNs) and their interconnection are causing unintended repetition of content storage in the same dCDN. This can be avoided by using a suitable de-duplication mechanism. This document explores the scenarios which create the problem, and then discusses the approaches to eliminate the duplicated transmission of the same content from uCDN(s) to dCDN in CDNi networks. To implement the optimization, some enhancement to the CDNi metadata model and interface is required. We realize that for business-specific purposes the same content may be encrypted/packaged with different keys for different providers. The impact of DRM (Digital Rights Management) technology on de- duplication will be discussed in a future version of this draft.</t>
