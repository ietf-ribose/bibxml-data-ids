      <t>DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) introduces a mechanism for expressing domain-level policies and preferences for email message validation, disposition, and reporting. The use of restrictive policies through the DMARC framework can cause interoperability issues when messages do not flow directly from the author's administrative domain to the final recipients. Collectively these email flows are referred to as indirect email flows. This document describes interoperability issues between DMARC and indirect email flows. Possible methods for addressing interoperability issues are presented.</t>
