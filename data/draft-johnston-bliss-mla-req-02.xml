    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the requirements and implementation of a group telephony feature commonly known as Bridged Line Appearance (BLA) or Multiple Line Appearance (MLA), or Shared Call/Line Appearance (SCA). When implemented using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), it is referred to as Multiple Appearances (MA) since SIP does not have lines. This feature is commonly offered in the IP Centrex services and IP-PBX offerings and is likely to be implemented on SIP IP telephones and SIP feature servers used in a business environment. This document lists requirements and compares implementation options for this feature. Extensions to the SIP dialog event package are proposed.</t>
