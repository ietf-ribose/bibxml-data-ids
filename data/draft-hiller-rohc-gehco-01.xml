      <t>The Robust Header Compression Working Group has embarked upon the development and standardization of header compression schemes that perform well over links with high error rates and long round-trip times. The goal is that the schemes must perform well for cellular links built using technologies such as WCDMA, EDGE, and cdma2000.</t>
