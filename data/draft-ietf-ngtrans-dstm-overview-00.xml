      <t>The initial deployment of IPv6 will require a tightly coupled use of IPv4 addresses to support the interoperation of IPv6 and IPv4 within an IPv6-only Network. Nodes will still need to communicate with IPv4 nodes that do not have a dual IP layer supporting both IPv4 and IPv6. The Dual Stack Transition Mechanism (DSTM) is based on the use of IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnels to carry IPv4 traffic within an IPv6-only network and provides a method to allocate a temporary IPv4 Address to IPv6/IPv4 nodes. DSTM is also a way to avoid the use of Network Address Translation for early adopter IPv6 deployment.</t>
