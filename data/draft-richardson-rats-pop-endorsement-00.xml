      <t>Some aspects of a device can not be intuited by the device itself. For instance, a router platform may have no way to know what color the case is, where in a cabinet it is located, or which electrical circuit it is connected to. This kind of information must be provided through an Endorsement: a statement from a third party. These statements may require human audiitors to inspect the device physically. But, which device is really in front of an auditor? This document describes a mechanism by which an auditor can make physical contact with a device and collect information to identify the device in a cryptographically strong manner. This protocol is not designed to run over Internet Protocol cabling, but rather over mechanisms such as USB cables, or serial consoles.</t>
