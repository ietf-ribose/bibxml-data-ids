    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines YANG modules to add support for classifying traffic received on interfaces as Ethernet/VLAN framed packets to sub-interfaces based on the fields available in the Ethernet/VLAN frame headers. These modules allow IETF forwarding protocols (such as IPv6 and VPLS) to interoperate with VLAN tagged traffic orginated from an IEEE 802.1Q compliant bridge. Primarily the classification is based on VLAN identifiers in the 802.1Q VLAN tags, but the model also has support for matching on some other layer 2 frame header fields and is designed to be extensible to match on other arbitrary header fields. The model differs from an IEEE 802.1Q bridge model in that the configuration is interface/sub-interface based as opposed to being based on membership of an 802.1Q VLAN bridge.</t>
