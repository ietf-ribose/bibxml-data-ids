      <t>Various proposals have been made for updating the IKE protocol.One thing which is missing from the dicussion is an evaluation of thescope of IKE, identifying which problems it should solve. Once thisscoping is done, it becomes easier to specify the requirements forthe protocol, as well as the protocol itself. Sections of thisdocument discuss various scenarios that are considered important forIKE; this list needs to be refined by the WG.</t>
