      <t>We suggest a more conservative management of TCP's retransmit timerand a more careful response of the TCP sender on duplicate ACKs. Theformer reduces the risk of triggering spurious timeouts, while thelatter eliminates potentially unnecessary retransmits. Although, webelieve that these suggestions are permitted (although notexplicitly) by RFC2581 and RFC2988, they do not seem to be widelyknown nor deployed in existing TCP implementations. We therefore wantto make implementers aware of these choices.</t>
