      <t>This document presents a new method to implement the NAT function,which requires the cooperating of the hosts and the NAT gateway. Theproposed NAT mechanism is called Host-initiated NAT, or HI-NAT forshort. Traditional NAT function is performed in the gateway, whilethe hosts are not aware of the address translation at all. Onedrawback of such mechanism is that all translation works need to bedone in one device, the NAT gateway, which may bring performancebottleneck. The presented HI-NAT mechanism shows another possiblesolution to improve network performance by the cooperating of thehosts and the Gateway. In more details, the hosts will initiate theNAT procedure with its local IP address. After getting the translatedIP address, the hosts will use it in every packet sending out to easethe translating workload of the NAT gateway.</t>
