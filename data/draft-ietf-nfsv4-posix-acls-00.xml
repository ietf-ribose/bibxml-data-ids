    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes four new optional file attributes for NFSv4.2 to support POSIX ACLs conforming to the withdrawn POSIX 1003.1e draft 17. Although never ratified, POSIX ACLs are implemented in widely deployed operating systems. Existing attempts to map between NFSv4 and POSIX ACL models have been unsuccessful due to semantic incompatibilities. These new attributes allow servers to expose POSIX ACLs directly, avoiding lossy mapping.</t>
