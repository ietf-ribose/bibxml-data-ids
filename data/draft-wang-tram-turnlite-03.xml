    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes a new relay-based NAT traversal architecture called TURN-Lite which could simplify the data communication process between two hosts that locates behind some non-BEHAVE compliant [RFC4787] [RFC5382] NAT devices. The key mechanism in TURN-Lite is the newly defined "Couple" operation (using STUN [RFC5389] message format) which allows the TURN-Lite servers to be easily incorporated into existing CGN devices/CDN nodes which are already deployed within the network in a distributed manner.</t>
