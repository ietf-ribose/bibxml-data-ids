      <t>The NETLMM WG standardized Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). PMIPv6enables mobile devices to connect to a PMIPv6 domain and roam acrossgateways without changing the IP address.Current PMIPv6 specification does only support the movement of hostswithin the localized mobility domain. A mobile network (commonlyreferred to as a NEMO, NEtwork that MOves) can also benefit from thenetwork-based localized mobility support provided by PMIPv6, but in alimited way. This I-D describes what can be done with currentstandardized protocols, and describes the problem statement of fullysupporting network mobility in Proxy Mobile IPv6.The goal of this document is to present the problem -- and the usecases where this problem is relevant to be solved -- to collectfeedback from the community about the interest in working on thisproblem.</t>
