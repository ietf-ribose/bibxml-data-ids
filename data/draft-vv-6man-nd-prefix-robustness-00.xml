      <t>IPv6 prefixes could become invalid abruptly as a result of outages, network administrator actions, or particular product shortcomings. That could lead to connectivity problems for the hosts attached to the subtended network. This document has two targets: on the one hand, to analyze the cases that may lead to network prefix invalidity; on the other to develop a root cause analysis for those cases and propose a solution. This may bring to extensions of the protocols used to convey prefix information and other options.</t>
