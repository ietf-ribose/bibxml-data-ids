      <t>The Appliance Class Identifier option is used by a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) client to identify the type of appliance it is. The information contained in this option is an opaque field that represents the appliance class of which the client belongs. Based on this class, a DHCP server selects the appropriate address pool to assign an address and the appropriate configuration parameters to the client. The value of this option should be selected by the appliance manufacturer and included in the DHCP Discover/Request messages. Multiple vendors may choose to use the same appliance class identifier for like appliances (an IP phone for example).</t>
