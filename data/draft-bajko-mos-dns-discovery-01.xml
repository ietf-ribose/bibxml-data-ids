      <t>This document defines application service tags that allow service location without relying on rigid domain naming conventions, and DNS procedures for discovering servers which provide Mobility Services. Mobility Services are used to assist an MN in handover preparation (network discovery) and handover decision (network selection). The services addressed by this document are the Media Independent Handover Services defined in [1].</t>
