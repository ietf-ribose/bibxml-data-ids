      <t>This note describes mechanisms for address selection in hosts within a multihomed site. The goal of these mechanisms is to allow hosts within the multihomed site to establish new communications after an outage. The presented mechanisms are not by themselves a complete multihoming solution but rather a component of such solution.</t>
