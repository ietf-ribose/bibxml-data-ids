    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes open research challenges for emerging media- oriented ensemble applications. One such driving scenario is the network delivery of virtual orchestra that imposes multi-disciplinary challenges. Specifically, of interest are the group communication patterns in the production, delivery and consumption as different dimensions relating to the communication networks. This document brings forth current research and engineering challenges in immersive media ensembles. The network domain problems come down to the specification of coordination of the received content with dependency constraints. The challenges depict both real and quasi- realtime behavior. A number of endpoint actors get involved in delivering the ensemble aspect, the research challenges also describe the expectations from the end points.</t>
