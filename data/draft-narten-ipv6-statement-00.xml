      <t>Over the last year, the Internet community has slowly come to realizethat the IANA and RIR IPv4 free address pool will be exhausted withinno more than 3-4 years, and possibly sooner. At that point, it willbecome increasingly difficult for ISPs and end sites to obtain thepublic IPv4 address space they need to expand operations.IPv6 was developed to address the IPv4 address exhaustion problem,but widespread deployment has barely begun. This document reiteratesthe IETF's support and continued commitment to IPv6. IPv6 deploymentis still necessary to ensure the continued growth and expansion ofthe Internet. Deployment of IPv6 is needed to preserve importantInternet properties that have made it a success and enable newgenerations of applications and services.</t>
