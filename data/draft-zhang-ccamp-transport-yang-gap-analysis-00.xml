      <t>A transport network is a lower-layer network designed to provide connectivity services for a higher-layer network to carry the traffic opaquely across the lower-layer network resources. A transport network may be constructed from equipment utilizing any of a number of different transport technologies such as the evolving optical transport infrastructure (Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET) / Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and Optical Transport Network (OTN)) or packet transport as epitomized by the MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP). All transport networks have high benchmarks for reliability and operational simplicity. This suggests a common, technology- independent management/control paradigm that can be extended to represent and configure specific technology attributes. This document describes the high-level requirements facing transport networks in order to provide open interfaces for resource programmability and control/management automation. Furtheremore, gap analysis against existing models are also provided so that it can used as the guidance to separate efforts/drafts proposing new models or augmentation models based on existing models.</t>
