      <t>This document proposes a method for improving the ability of the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) to assist in renumbering an internet. DHCP is already capable of supporting host renumbering by assigning a new address when a client attempts to renegotiate an existing lease, but this proposal makes host renumbering more graceful by providing for a transition period in which the client can use both addresses.</t>
