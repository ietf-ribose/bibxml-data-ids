      <t>RFC 3177 argued that in IPv6, end sites should be assigned /48 blocksin most cases. The Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) adopted thatrecommendation in 2002, but began reconsidering the policy in 2005.This document revisits and updates the RFC 3177 recommendations onthe assignment of IPv6 address space to end sites. The exact choiceof how much address space to assign end sites is a policy issue underthe purview of the RIRs, subject to IPv6 architectural andoperational considerations. This document reviews the architecturaland operational considerations of end site assignments as well as themotivations behind the original 3177 recommendations. Moreover, thedocument clarifies that a one-size-fits-all recommendation of /48 isnot nuanced enough for the broad range of end sites and is no longerrecommended as a single default.This document updates and replaces RFC 3177.</t>
