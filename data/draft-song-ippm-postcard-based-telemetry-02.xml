    <abstract>
      <t>The Postcard-Based Telemetry (PBT) allows network OAM applications to collect telemetry data about any user packet. Unlike the E2E and trace modes in in-situ OAM (IOAM), PBT does not require user packets to carry the telemetry data, but directly exports the telemetry data from the data collecting node to a collector through separated OAM packets called postcards. Two variations of PBT are described: one requires inserting an instruction header to user packets to guide the data collection and the other only marks the user packets or configure the flow filter to invoke the data collection. PBT provides a complement to IOAM and address several implementation and deployment challenges of it.</t>
