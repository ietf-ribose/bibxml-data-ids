    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an emulation architecture which provides a realistic, flexible, and extensible experimental environment for the space network (SN). The architecture includes four components, namely logical plane, control plane, data plane and measurement plane. Software-defined networking (SDN), virtualization technology, and traffic control mechanism are adopted to realize the real space environment and arbitrary topology. Furthermore, an extensible structure is described to emulate large-scale scenarios and access external emulation resources.</t>
