    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the objectives and requirements of flow aggregation in scaling networks. It proposes a scheme by aggregating DetNet flows based on DetNet flow-specific classification in enhanced DetNet, and suggests the flow identification of aggregated-class be used to indicate the required treatment and forwarding behaviors in scaling networks. Toward the end, the draft discuss how the novel flow aggregation scheme could be applied to realize the flow aggregation in a 5GS logical DetNet node participating in enhanced DetNet.</t>
