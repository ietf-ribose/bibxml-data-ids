      <t>The SIP working group has been grappling with a variety of very difficult problems lately. These include early media, coupling of resource reservation and call signaling, and the so-called Heterogeneous Error Response Forking Problem (HERFP). Additional problems being considered include supporting capability negotiation for indicating support any one of one-of-N codecs, upgrading the security on RTP streams, and demultiplexing media from a forked INVITE. In this document, we present a unified view of all of these problems, and present a unified solution that solves all of them in the same way.</t>
