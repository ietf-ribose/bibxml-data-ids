      <t>The SIP working group has been grappling with a variety of verydifficult problems lately. These include early media, coupling ofresource reservation and call signaling, and the so-calledHeterogeneous Error Response Forking Problem (HERFP). Additionalproblems being considered include supporting capability negotiationfor indicating support any one of one-of-N codecs, upgrading thesecurity on RTP streams, and demultiplexing media from a forkedINVITE. In this document, we present a unified view of all of theseproblems, and present a unified solution that solves all of them inthe same way.</t>
