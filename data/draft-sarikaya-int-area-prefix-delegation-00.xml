      <t>According to IPv6 operation in cellular networks, one prefix can only be assigned to one interface of a mobile node by an access router and different mobile nodes can't share a prefix. Managing Per-MN interface prefixes is likely to increase the processing load at the access router. Based on the idea that DHCPv6 servers can manage prefixes as well as addresses, we propose a new technique in which the access router offloads delegation and release tasks of the prefixes to an DHCPv6 server. The access router first requests a prefix for an incoming mobile node to the DHCPv6 server. The access router next advertises the prefix information to the mobile node with a Router Advertisement message. When the mobile node hands off, the prefix is returned to the DHCPv6 server. We also describe how AAA servers can help in prefix delegation. Status of this Memo This Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with the provisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.
