      <t>The Network Access Identifier can be added to a Mobile IP registration request to identify the user and to allow the assignment of a dynamic home address. However, users may want to open several simultaneous sessions using the same NAI from the same or different devices and to obtain a unique IP address for each session. The Mobile IP Session Identifier Extension defined in this draft can be used to distinguish registration requests belonging to these various sessions. This draft also clarifies how a dynamic address is to be managed when and if the user returns to the home network that assigned the address.</t>
