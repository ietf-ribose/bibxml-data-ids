    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions for grouping two unidirectional MPLS-TE Label Switched Paths (LSPs), one in each direction in the network, into an Associated Bidirectional LSP. The mechanisms defined in this document can be applied using a Stateful PCE for both PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated LSPs, as well as when using a Stateless PCE. The procedures defined are applicable to the LSPs using RSVP-TE for signaling.</t>
