      <t>This document defines extensions to the Mobile IP protocol [1] toallow mobility management for the interface between a radio networkand a packet data network in the third generation cdma2000 network.Mobile IP requires link layer connectivity between the Mobile Nodeand the Foreign Agent. This draft proposes a protocol for achievingthis when the physical layer terminating at a point distant from theFA. In particular, this protocol applies to cdma2000 networks wherethe physical layer terminates at a Radio Network Node (RNN) and theFA resides inside a separate Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN). ThePDSN is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminatingthe link layer to the Mobile Node. A RNN is responsible for relayingthe link layer protocol between a Mobile Node and its correspondingPDSN.The interface between the RNN and the PDSN is called the RPinterface. This interface requires mobility management for handlinghandoff from one RNN to another without interrupting end to endcommunication. It also requires the support of the link layerprotocol encapsulation.</t>
