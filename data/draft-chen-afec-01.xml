      <t>This document generally describes how to use an Adaptive Forward Error Correction (AFEC) algorithm to efficiently protect the compressed header vital data as well as UDP-Liteâ€™s vital data for data transport in the radio-link layer of an error-prone wireless connection. Augmented with RoHC and UDP-Lite, for video transmissions over wireless channels in a heterogeneous wired- wireless environment, the erroneous packet payloads can be useful and the applications better able to cope with lost packets (native UDP case), by adopting some of the erasure and error resilient modes in the latest video codecs, such as H.264. The context transfer in the inter/intra handover is also covered.</t>
