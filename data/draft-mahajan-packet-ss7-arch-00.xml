      <t>The transition from circuit based voice telephony network to purepacket based voice telephony network requires huge investment. Italso requires setting of a parallel packet voice telephony networkcomponents with definition of packet network signalling protocolsand packet network bearer transport protocols and in addition,support for intelligent services on packet network. This paper defines a Packet-SS7 network. This paper tries to explore the idea of modifying existing SS7network protocol and network architecture to support packet voiceservices on it. It can also provide an easy transition path fromcircuit voice network to pure packet voice network.</t>
