      <t>The transition from circuit based voice telephony network to pure packet based voice telephony network requires huge investment. It also requires setting of a parallel packet voice telephony network components with definition of packet network signalling protocols and packet network bearer transport protocols and in addition, support for intelligent services on packet network. This paper defines a Packet-SS7 network. This paper tries to explore the idea of modifying existing SS7 network protocol and network architecture to support packet voice services on it. It can also provide an easy transition path from circuit voice network to pure packet voice network.</t>
