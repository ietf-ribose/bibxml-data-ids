    <abstract>
      <t>Many end user sites in the Internet today still have predominantly IPv4 internal infrastructures. These sites range in size from small home/office networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but share the commonality that IPv4 continues to provide operational internal routing and addressing services for most applications. As more and more IPv6-only services are deployed, however, end user devices within such sites will increasingly require at least basic IPv6 functionality. This document therefore discusses updates to the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) to better accommodate these needs.</t>
