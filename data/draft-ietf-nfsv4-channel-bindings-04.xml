      <t>This document defines and formalizes the concept of channel bindingsto secure layers and defines the channel bindings for several typesof secure channels.The concept of channel bindings allows applications to prove that theend-points of two secure channels at different network layers are thesame by binding authentication at one channel to the sessionprotection at the other channel. The use of channel bindings allowsapplications to delegate session protection to lower layers, whichmay significantly improve performance for some applications.</t>
