      <t>Resource and service discovery are complimentary. Resource discovery provides fine-grained detail about the content of a server, while service discovery can provide a scalable method to locate servers in large networks. This document defines a method for mapping between CoRE Link Format attributes and DNS-Based Service Discovery fields to allow either method to be used to locate service interfaces down to the granularity of function sets in mixed HTTP/CoAP environments.</t>
