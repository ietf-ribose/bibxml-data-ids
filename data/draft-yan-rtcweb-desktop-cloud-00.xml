      <t>The Web Real-time Communications (WebRTC) provides the communication capabilities for real-time and peer-to-peer web-based applications. This draft is meant to provide the structure for an idea of how WebRTC works on the desktop cloud solution and gives guidance on how to overcome the issues and challenges in implementing and deploying. Also as discussed in the mail archive before, the use case for desktop cloud or remote desktop sharing is suggested to be delayed after WebRTC version 1. So this draft is very early and far from done.</t>
