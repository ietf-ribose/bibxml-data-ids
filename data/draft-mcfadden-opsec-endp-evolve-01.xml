      <t>This draft discusses the traditional model of security where endpoints in the network are protected by a variety of tools. It proposes a model for endpoints and then argues that the older, traditional approach is no longer sufficient for operational security at the endpoint. A series of operational examples are discussed in an Appendix.</t>
