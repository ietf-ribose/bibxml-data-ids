      <t>Since the route of packets to the same anycast adddress may change according to the network/node condition, it is not suitable to use anycast addresses directry for stateful communications (such as TCP). The more preferable use of the anycast addresses is to discover (the unicast address of) service node. The approach intended to describe in this document is to resolve (i.e., obtain) the corresponding unicast address for the anycast address prior to establishing the communication. We call this process as Anycast Address Resolving (AARP). The objevtive of the AARP is to enable the use of anycast addresses to all existing applications without any modifications.</t>
