    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a universal, tunnel-less mechanism for Secure Service Edge (SSE) steering based on a new SSE Identification Header (SSE-ID). The architecture enables endpoints, OS network stacks, and enterprise SD-WAN edge devices to signal the intent for traffic to be routed to an SSE provider without using GRE or IPsec tunnels. This document also defines an SD-WAN extension called the Direct Switchover Token (DST). DST provides a vendor-agnostic mechanism enabling SD-WAN spokes to establish direct, encrypted, spoke-to-spoke paths for traffic that does not require SSE inspection. DST is issued by a central controller after initial packets reach a hub or the controller and after evaluating policy and SSE requirements. Additionally, this document introduces (a) a Participating ISP routing model using an SSE-Only Public Pool (SOPP) and an SSE POP ID (SPID) to locate and route to SSE edges on SSE-enabled circuits, and (b) a Merger &amp; Acquisition (M&amp;A) access mode that allows two enterprises to access resources via the SSE cloud using Enterprise IDs; in this mode, traffic is spliced inside the SSE fabric by EID, with address-domain isolation to avoid IP conflicts. Together, SSE-ID and DST—augmented with SOPP/SPID and M&amp;A mode— provide a unified, interoperable, and tunnel-less architecture for SSE integration, SD-WAN optimization, inter-domain routing, and enterprise-to-enterprise access.</t>
