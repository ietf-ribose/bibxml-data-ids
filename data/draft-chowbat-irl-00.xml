      <t>Many people learn technical concepts best in a hands-on environment, and Internet protocols and standards are no exception. Internet Research Labs (IRL) will facilitate a platform and encourage the technical community (seasoned professionals and newcomers alike) to discuss, collaborate, design and develop utilities, ideas, sample code and solutions that show practical implementations (Proof of Concept) of existing IETF standards. These labs may also be used by the IETF Mentoring Program and/or EDU teams for hands-on training to mentees or newcomers. This base draft intends to provide a high-level overview of the concept of Internet Research Labs in terms of objectives, requirements, challenges and deliverables without going into details of a specific lab, technology or an IETF Working Group (WG). After this draft matures and gains traction within the IETF community, we foresee more and more Internet drafts for the specific labs.</t>
