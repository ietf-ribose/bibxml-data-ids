      <t>In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a captive portal mode. This highly restricts what the customer can do until the customer has authenticated. This document describes a DHCPv4 option (and an IPv6 RA extension) to inform clients that they are behind some sort of captive portal device, and that they will need to authenticate to get Internet Access.</t>
