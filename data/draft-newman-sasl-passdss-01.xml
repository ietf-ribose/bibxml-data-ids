    <abstract>
      <t>Some system administrators are faced with a choice between deploying a new authentication infrastructure or sending unencrypted passwords in the clear over the Internet. Deploying a new authentication infrastructure often involves modifying operating system services or keeping parallel authentication databases up to date and is thus unacceptable to many administrators. Solutions which encrypt the entire session are often crippled with weak keys (due to government restrictions) which are unsuitable for passwords. In addition, such solutions often reduce performance of the entire session to an unacceptable level. This specification defines a SASL [SASL] mechanism which is compatible with existing password-based authentication databases and does not require a security layer for the remainder of the session. [NOTE: Public discussion of this mechanism may take place on the ietf-sasl@imc.org mailing list with a subscription address of ietf-sasl-request@imc.org.
