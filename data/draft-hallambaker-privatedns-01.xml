      <t>This document describes Private DNS, a transport security mechanism for the DNS protocol. The mechanism may be employed to secure communication between a client and its resolver or between a resolver and an authoritative server. Service binding including key exchange is effected using the JSON Service Connect (JCX) Protocol. DNS protocol messages are wrapped in a new framing protocol.</t>
