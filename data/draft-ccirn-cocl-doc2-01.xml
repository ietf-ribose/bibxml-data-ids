    <title>An Approach to CO/CL Interworking-- Part II: The Short-Term -- Conventions for Transport-Service Bridges in the Absence of Internetworking</title>
    <date year="1991" month="April" day="23"/>
    <abstract>
      <t>The Short-term approach outlined in ``An Approach to CO/CL Interworking: Part I: Introduction'' is based on the use of transport-layer relays known as transport service bridges, or TS-bridges. Further, the short-term approach also assumes that knowledge of the TS-bridges is present in the end-systems. The companion memo ``An Approach to CO/CL Interworking--Part III: The Intermediate-Term--Provision of the CONS over TCP and X.25 Subnetworks'' identifies solutions in which end-system knowledge of transport-layer relays is avoided. The purpose of this memo is two-fold: first, modifications to the operational characteristics of end-systems are described; and, second, the operational characteristics of TS-bridges are described.</t>
