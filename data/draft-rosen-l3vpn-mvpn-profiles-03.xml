      <t>The MVPN (Multicast Virtual Private Network) architecture is dividedinto a number of functional "layers". At each layer, multipleoptions are allowed. It is necessary to allow multiple options ateach layer because "one size doesn't fit all." However, it is notexpected that any particular implementation will support all thepossible combinations of options. To ensure multi-vendorinteroperability, it is useful to specify "profiles", where eachprofile is a particular combination of options. The number ofspecified profiles will be much less than the total number ofpossible combination, and a given implementation can be characterizedby saying which profiles it supports. This document describes twoprofiles that use a PIM control plane.</t>
