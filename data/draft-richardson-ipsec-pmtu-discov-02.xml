      <t>This document describes the problem of getting accurate Path MTU infor- mation in the presence of untrusted routers. Typical Path MTU discovery is done by sending packets with the don't fragment bit set, and listen- ing for ICMP messages from routers that want to fragment the packets. Unfortunately, these messages could be forged, and IPsec based security system(s) can not pass make direct use of these messages. An alternate, backwards compatible algorithm is suggested.</t>
