    <abstract>
      <t>Remote Attestation Procedures (RATS) enable Relying Parties to assess the trustworthiness of a remote Attester and therefore to decide whether to engage in secure interactions with it - or not. Evidence about trustworthiness can be rather complex and it is deemed unrealistic that every Relying Party is capable of the appraisal of Evidence. Therefore that burden is typically offloaded to a Verifier. In order to conduct Evidence appraisal, a Verifier requires fresh Evidence from an Attester. Before a Verifier can appraise Evidence it may require transformation to an internal representation. This document specifies Evidence transformation methods for DICE and SPDM formats to the CoRIM internal representation.</t>
