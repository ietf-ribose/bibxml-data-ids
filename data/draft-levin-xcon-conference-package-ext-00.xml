      <t>This document introduces global elements into the SIP Conference Event Package XML schema to make the conference objects and sub- objects easily accessible by schemas external to the event package, such as the XCON conference control protocols. This document also defines the way to introduce XCON extensions into the SIP Conference Event Package in a backwards compatible manner. This document also defines a set of extensions to the SIP Conference Event Package XML schema being used in the XCON conferencing architecture.</t>
