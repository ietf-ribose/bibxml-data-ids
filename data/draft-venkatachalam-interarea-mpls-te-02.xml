    <abstract>
      <t>In this draft, we propose an architecture for the inter-area LSP setup based on a combination of constraints. We derive the architectural requirements for the routing protocols, signaling protocols and the MIBs to support such an idea. We also demonstrate how such a mechanism will reduce the crankback during LSP setup. A possible outline of the modifications to the CSPF algorithm and examples are presented. In the companion document [INTER_AREA_EXT] we elaborate on the extensions required for such architecture.</t>
