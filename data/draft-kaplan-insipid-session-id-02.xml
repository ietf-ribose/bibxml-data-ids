      <t>This RFC, which contains the text of an individual Internet Draft that was submitted originally to the DISPATCH Working Group, is being published now as an Informational document to provide a reference for later RFCs. The mechanism defined in this document has been widely deployed, and is being followed in a backward- compatible fashion for a new Standards Track RFC in the INSIPID Working Group. The original Abstract follows. There is a need for having a globally unique session identifier for the same SIP session, which can be consistently maintained across Proxies, B2BUAs and other SIP middle-boxes, for the purpose of Troubleshooting. This draft proposes a new SIP header to carry such a value: Session-ID.</t>
