      <t>The ability of the system to deliver its normal service in the presence of any unexpected errors and able to recover from the errors and restore to normal operation is called a fault tolerant system. Such systems whose behavior is predictable in nearly every possible situation are often in redundant fault tolerant configurations. This document defines the various redundant fault tolerant configurations that make these systems dependable systems or high availability systems.</t>
