      <t>This document presents the motivation, design guidelines and high level descriptions of peer-to-peer session initiation protocol (P2PSIP) client protocol, which is spoken between P2PSIP peers and P2PSIP clients. In this document, the necessity of P2PSIP Client is identified firstly. Then, two fundamental guidelines for our design are explained in details. Following these guidelines, the design of proposed protocol and new extensions to existing SIP (session initiation protocol) are described. Such a SIP-based protocol not only makes itself backward-compatible with the vast existing SIP devices, but also provides extra functions to satisfy some particular requirements raised by P2PSIP.</t>
