      <t>The "Basic" authentication scheme defined in RFC 2617 does not properly define how to treat non-ASCII characters. This has led to a situation where user agent implementations disagree, and servers make different assumptions based on the locales they are running in. There is little interoperability for the non-ASCII characters in the ISO-8859-1 character repertoire, and even less interoperability for any characters beyond that. This document defines a backwards-compatible extension to "Basic", specifying the server's character encoding scheme expectation, using a new authentication scheme parameter.</t>
