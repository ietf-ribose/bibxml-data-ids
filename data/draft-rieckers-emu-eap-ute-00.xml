      <t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support for multiple authentication methods. This document defines the EAP-UTE authentication method for a User-assisted Trust Establishment between the peer and the server. The EAP method is intended for bootstrapping Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices without preconfigured authentication credentials. The trust establishment is achieved by transmitting a one-directional out-of-band (OOB) message between the peer and the server to authenticate the in-band exchange. The peer must have a secondary input or output interface, such as a display, camera, microphone, speaker, blinking light, or light sensor, so that dynamically generated messages with tens of bytes in length can be transmitted or received.</t>
