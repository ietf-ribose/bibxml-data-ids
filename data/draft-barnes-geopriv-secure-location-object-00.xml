      <t>Protection of location information is an essential requirement of the GEOPRIV architecture. Since using protocols cannot be relied upon to provide adequate protections to the location objects they carry, the location objects themselves must be secured. This document examines several candidates for a Secure Location Object format in the context of GEOPRIV and ECRIT security requirements, including both locations by value and by reference.</t>
