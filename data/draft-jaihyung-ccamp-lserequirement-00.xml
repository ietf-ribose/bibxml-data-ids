      <t>In this draft, we propose requirement to implement MPLS technologyfor Ethernet switched network. Ethernet has become major buildingblock in local area network and the area of deployment is quicklyexpanding to core network. While there have been industry needs toovercome weakness of Ethernet, MPLS has not been considered as keytechnology to improve Ethernet. Currently MPLS [RFC3031] and GMPLS[GARCH] architecture do not define label-switching function onL2SC interface, i.e. over LAN media. Hence, it is necessary todiscuss lightweight implementation of MPLS for Ethernet. Sincethere is disparity in requirements depending on hierarchy of Ethernet,it is appropriate to separate discussion in Customer Premise Network(CPN), Access Network (AN) and Core Network (CN). Some candidate methods to consider for label encoding for Ethernet are discussed.</t>
