    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines GORF, a Generic Opportunistic Routing Framework. GORF specifies all necessary basic functionality that is common for all utility-based routing protocols that are variants of the epidemic routing protocol for intermittently connected networks that operates by pruning the epidemic distribution tree to minimize resource usage while still attempting to achieve the best case routing capabilities of epidemic routing. It is intended for use in sparse mesh networks where there is no guarantee that a fully connected path between source and destination exists at any time, rendering traditional routing protocols unable to deliver messages between hosts. These networks are examples of networks where there is a disparity between the latency requirements of applications and the capabilities of the underlying network (networks often referred to as Delay- and Disruption-Tolerant). The document presents an architectural overview followed by the protocol specification.</t>
