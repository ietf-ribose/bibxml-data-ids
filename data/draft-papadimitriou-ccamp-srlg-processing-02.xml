      <t>The Shared Risk Link Group (SRLG) concept introduced in [IPO-Frame]and extended in [CCAMP-SRG] is considered as one of the mostimportant criteria concerning the constraint-based path computationof optical channel routes. By applying the SRLG disjointnesscriteria to the constraint-based path computation, one can select aroute taking into account both resource and logical structuredisjointness. That implies a lower probability of simultaneousoptical channel failure.This document describes the various physical and logical resourcetypes considered in the SRLG concept. The proposed method focuses onthe inference of SRLG information between the network physical andlogical layers and the logical structures representing geographicallocations. The main applications of the proposed model are relatedto the Constraint-based Shortest Path First (CSPF) algorithm foroptical channel route computation and the aggregation of the SRLGinformation flooded throughout traffic engineering extensions of theIGP routing protocols (such as OSPF and IS-IS).</t>
