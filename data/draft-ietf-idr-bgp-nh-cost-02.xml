    <abstract>
      <t>BGPLS provides a mechanism by which Link state and traffic engineering information can be collected from internal networks and shared with external network routers using BGP. BGPLS defines a new Address Family to exchange this information using BGP. BGP Optimal Route Reflection (ORR) provides a mechanism for a centralized BGP Route Reflector to acheive requirements of a Hot Potato Routing as described in Section 11 of [RFC4456]. Optimal Route Reflection requires BGP ORR to overwrite the default IGP location placement of the route reflector; which is used for determining cost to the nexthop contained in the path. This draft augments BGPLS and defines a new extensions to exchange cost information to next-hops for the purpose of calculating best path from a peer perspective rather than local BGP speaker own perspective.</t>
