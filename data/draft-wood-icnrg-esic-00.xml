      <t>This document describes how to transport CCNx packets inside an encrypted session between peers - a sender and receiver - that share a traffic secret, such as that which is derived from [CCNxKE]. The peers create an outer naming context to identify the encryption session in one direction between the sender and the receiver. The sender issues encrypted Interest messages to the receiver, who responds with encrypted Content Objects. Inside the outer context, the sender sends Interests with different names, for which the receiver may reply to or send InterestReturns in response. There does not need to be a naming relationship between the outer names and the inner names. The inner content is still protected by normal CCNx authentication mechanisms and possibly encrypted under other schemes.</t>
