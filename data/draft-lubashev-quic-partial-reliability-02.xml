      <t>This memo introduces MIN_STREAM_DATA and EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frames to enable partial reliability for QUIC streams. The EXPIRED_STREAM_DATA frame allows a sender to give up on retransmitting older parts of a stream and to notify the receiver about this decision. The MIN_STREAM_DATA frame allows a receiver to express its disinterest in older parts of a stream. The content of this draft is intended for merging into QUIC transport, recovery, and applicability drafts as a negotiable extension and/or QUIC Version 2 transport feature.</t>
