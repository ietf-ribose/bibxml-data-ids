      <t>Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques and many MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in very high bandwidth applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core networks. MPLS-TP has strongly discouraged the use of multipath techniques. Some degradation of MPLS-TP OAM performance cannot be avoided when operating over many types of multipath implementations. Using MPLS Entropy label, MPLS can LSP can be carried over multipath links while also providing a fully MPLS-TP compliant server layer for MPLS-TP LSP. This document describes the means of supporting MPLS as a server layer for MPLS-TP. The use of MPLS-TP LSP as a server layer for MPLS LSP is also discussed.</t>
