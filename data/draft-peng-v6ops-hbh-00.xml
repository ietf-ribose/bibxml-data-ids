      <t>This document describes the processing of the Hop-by-Hop Options Header in today's routers in the aspects of standards specification, common implementations, and default operations. This document outlines the reasons why the Hop-by-Hop Options Header is rarely utilized in current networks. In addition, this document describes why the HBH could be used as a powerful mechanism allowing deployment and operations of new services requiring a more optimized way to leverage network resources of an infrastructure. The Hop-by-Hop Options Header is taken into consideration as a valuable container for carrying the information facilitating the introduction of new services. The desired, and proposed, processing behavior of the HBH and the migration strategies towards it are also suggested.</t>
