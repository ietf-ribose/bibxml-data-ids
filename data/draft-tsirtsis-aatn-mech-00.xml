      <t>This document attempts to list mechanisms that if added to the Internet protocols could take us some way in providing well desirable alternatives and improvements to NAT. Some of the techniques and components described here are controversial and their appearance in this document does not mean that the author supports them. We merely attempt to list the options and issues (most of them already known) as a starting point for an elimination and selection process.</t>
