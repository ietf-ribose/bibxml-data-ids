      <t>Traditionally, multicast trees in the Internet are built bottom-up.The construction of multicast trees depends on the multicastreceivers's ability to inform their next hop multicast routers abouttheir multicast group memberships. There are cases, in which thetraditional host-driven way of building the multicast trees isinsufficient. To point out one, consider an access network withunidirectional links. In a mobile environment, this requires that thereceiving interface of a mobile node must also have the capabilitiesto send out MLD or IGMP responses. This is not possible for broadcastnetworks (e.g DVB-T and DAB), that provide high downstream datarates, but no uplink connectivity.This document presents Source Controlled Multicast as a proposalsolution to overcome the problems with unidirectional links. Itpresents a way to for source to control the multicast tree joiningprocess on behalf of mobile nodes behind unidirectional links.</t>
