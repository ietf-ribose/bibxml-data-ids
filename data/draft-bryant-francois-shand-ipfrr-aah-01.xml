      <t>IPFRR and loop-free convergence techniques can deal with singletopology change events, multiple correlated change events, and insome cases even certain uncorrelated events. However, in all casesthere are events which cannot be dealt with and the mechanism needsto quickly revert to normal convergence. This is known as"Abandoning All Hope" (AAH). This document describes the nature ofthe problem, and various proposed mechanisms to deal with it.</t>
