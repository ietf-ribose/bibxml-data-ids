    <abstract>
      <t>IPFRR and loop-free convergence techniques can deal with single topology change events, multiple correlated change events, and in some cases even certain uncorrelated events. However, in all cases there are events which cannot be dealt with and the mechanism needs to quickly revert to normal convergence. This is known as "Abandoning All Hope" (AAH). This document describes the nature of the problem, and various proposed mechanisms to deal with it.</t>
