      <t>This document proposes a framework for context transfer between the access routers. The framework identifies the various functional elements that participate in the process of context transfer and the protocols required to exchange information between the functional entities. Included are a few samples of context transfer scenarios to assist in explaining the interactions of the entities in the framework.</t>
