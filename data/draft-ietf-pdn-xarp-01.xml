    <title>X.121 Address Resolution for IP Datagram Transmission Over X.25 Networks</title>
    <date year="1990" month="July" day="27"/>
    <abstract>
      <t>X.121 Address Resolution is important for the routing of Internet datagrams through the worldwide system of X.25 Public Data Networks. An X.121 Address Resolution Protocol (XARP) with several options has been presented in this document. Depending whether the mapping between the Internet (PDN-cluster) address of a PDN-host or VAN-gateway and its corresponding X.121 address on the X.25 network can be solved locally, or by another PDN-host or VAN-gateway, or even by a remote X.121 address server, not directly connected to the X.25 network, the appropriate option can be chosen.</t>
