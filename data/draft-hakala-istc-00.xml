      <t>This document discusses how International Standard Text Work Codes (ISTCs; persistent and unique identifiers for textual works) can be supported within the URN framework and the syntax for URNs defined in RFC 2141 [Moats]. Analysis is in part based on the ideas expressed in RFC 2288 [Lynch], which analysed the use of ISSN, ISBN and SICI as URNs. Chapter 5 contains a URN namespace registration request modelled according to the template in RFC 2611 [Daigle et al.].</t>
