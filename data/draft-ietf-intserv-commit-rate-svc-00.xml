      <t>This document describes the network element behavior required to deliver a Committed Rate service in the Internet. The Committed Rate service provides applications with a firm commitment from the network, that at a minimum the transmission rate they requested is available to them at each network element on their path. The commitment of a given transmission rate by a network element is not associated with a specific delay guarantee, but requires that network elements perform admission control to avoid over-allocation of resources.</t>
