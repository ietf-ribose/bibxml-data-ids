      <t>This document defines a "Limits" extension for the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), including submisssion, as well as the Local Mail Transfer Protocol (LMTP). It also defines an associated limit registry. This extension provides the means for an SMTP, submission, or LMTP server to inform the client of limits the server intends to apply to the protocol during the current session. The client is then able to adapt its behavior in order to conform to those limits.</t>
