      <t>Requesting nodes typically acquire IPv6 prefixes from a prefix delegation service for the network. The requesting node can provision the prefix according to whether it acts as a router on behalf of any downstream networks and/or as a host on behalf of its local applications. In the latter case, the requesting node can use portions of the delegated prefix for its own multi-addressing purposes. This document therefore considers prefix delegation models for both the classic routing and various multi-addressing use cases.</t>
