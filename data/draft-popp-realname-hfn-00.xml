    <abstract>
      <t>The notion of a 'Human Friendly Naming scheme' (HFN) has been discussed in a variety of contexts, as an alternative to the use of URIs or URNs as a way of designating Internet resources (see [RFC 2276], for example). This document introduces the RealName system, and its use as a HFN. It provides a mapping for RealNames into a URN namespace ('rn') as well as a URL scheme ('vnd.rn'). This is a preliminary draft, intended to raise the discussion of HFNs and the uses of RealNames as an initial example in creating a standard for access and resolution.</t>
