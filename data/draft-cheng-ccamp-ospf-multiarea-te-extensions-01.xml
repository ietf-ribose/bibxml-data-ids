      <t>The [MULTI-AREA] introduces a set of mechanisms that could be usedto construct LSPs that span multiple IS-IS/OSPF areas, where one scenario is to allow the head-end LSR to compute the path all theway to the ABR in the tail-end area. This document proposes somenew OSPF extensions that can be used in supporting that scenario,i.e., by leaking some of the useful information from individual areas to others, the constraint-based routing at the head-end LSRof LSPs in OSPF networks with multiple areas can be optimized.</t>
