      <t>This document defines a functional model for forwarding elements (FEs) used in the Forwarding and Control Plane Separation (ForCES) protocol. This model is used to describe the capabilities, capacities, state and configuration of ForCES forwarding elements within the context of the ForCES protocol, so that ForCES control elements (CEs) can control the FEs accordingly. The model is to specify what logical functions are present in the FEs, what capabilities these functions support, and how these functions are or can be interconnected. The forwarding element model defined herein is intended to satisfy the requirements specified in the ForCES requirements draft [FORCES-REQ]. Using this model, predefined or vendor specific logical functions can be expressed and configured. However, the definition of these individual functions are not described and defined in this document.</t>
