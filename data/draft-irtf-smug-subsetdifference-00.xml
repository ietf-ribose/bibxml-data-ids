    <title>Subset-Difference based Key Management for Secure Multicast</title>
    <date year="2001" month="August" day="13"/>
    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a key management mechanism for multicast communication sessions that is based on the 'Subset-Difference' algorithm. The Subset-Difference algorithm is a new revocation scheme which allows a Center (such as a Group Controller/ Key Manager) to send a message so that *every* authorized receiver, but none of the revoked receivers, can decrypt.</t>
