      <t>This document describes a key management mechanism for multicastcommunication sessions that is based on the 'Subset-Difference'algorithm. The Subset-Difference algorithm is a new revocationscheme which allows a Center (such as a Group Controller/ Key Manager)to send a message so that *every* authorized receiver, butnone of the revoked receivers, can decrypt.</t>
