      <t>This memo specifies enhancements to Mobile IP that allow IP mobility support across routing realms. The protocol allows a mobile node to have the same home network connectivity, regardless of its current routing realm network point of attachment. It is designed to work in the presence of address collisions and network address translations. Private networks connected to the public Internet can extend IP mobility support to cover the public Internet and other private networks. Movement from a private home network to the public foreign network, from a private home network to another private foreign network or from the public home network to a private foreign network are possible under the MPN framework.</t>
