      <t>This document presents an architecture for an IPv6 multilink subnet that is composed of a high speed powered backbone and a number of IEEE802.15.4e TSCH wireless networks attached and synchronized by Backbone Routers. Route Computation may be achieved in a centralized fashion by a Path Computation Element, in a distributed fashion using the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks, or in a mixed mode. The Backbone Routers perform proxy Neighbor discovery operations over the backbone on behalf of the wireless device, so they can share a same subnet and appear to be connected to the same backbone as classical devices.</t>
