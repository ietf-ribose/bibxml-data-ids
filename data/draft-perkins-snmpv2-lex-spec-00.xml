      <t>This memo integrates the specifications for the lexical elements of the MIB module language from section 8 of the ASN.1 specification[4], augmented by the ASN.1 macros defined for the MIB module language, and modified by textual descriptions in SMIv2(RFCs 1902[1], 1903[2] and 1904[3]); and the standard practices found in most of the leading MIB compilers that are accepted by the SNMP community. Also include in this memo is a Lex specification for the tokens of the language. This memo is a rough first draft as requested by the SNMPv2 WG at the SMI Documentation BOF during the June 1996 IETF.</t>
