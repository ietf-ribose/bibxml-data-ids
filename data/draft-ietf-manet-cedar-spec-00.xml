    <abstract>
      <t>This draft presents CEDAR, a Core-Extraction Distributed Ad hoc Routing algorithm for QoS routing in ad hoc network environments. CEDAR has three key components: (a) the establishment and maintenance of a self-organizing routing infrastructure, called the 'core', for performing route computations, (b) the propagation of the link-state of stable high-bandwidth links in the core through 'increase/decrease' waves, and (c) a QoS route computation algorithm that is executed at the core nodes using only locally available state.</t>
