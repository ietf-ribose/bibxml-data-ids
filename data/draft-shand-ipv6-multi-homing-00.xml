    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines various forms of host multihoming, identifies the requirements associated with each and suggests means by which they could be supported in the IPv6 environment. The intention is to provoke discussion, leading to a general consensus as to which scenarios and requirements are important, and which potential solutions are appropriate for further study. It is an update to the previous draft &lt;draft-shand-ipv6-multi-homing-00.txt&gt; posted in February 1996.</t>
