    <abstract>
      <t>In defining the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL), some features have turned up that would be nice to have. In the interest of completing this specification in a timely manner, the present document was started to collect nice-to-have features that did not make it into the first RFC for CDDL, RFC 8610. It is now time to discuss thawing some of the concepts discussed here. A number of additional proposals have been added.</t>
