      <t>Without a security solution, Mobile IPv6 Route Optimization function­ ality exposes the involved nodes as well as other nodes in the Inter­ net to various security attacks. Recent work in the area has produced a number of proposals to solve these security issues. The proposals are, however, in many cases architecturally quite different from each other, and don't always describe more than a part of the solution. Due to the complexity of the problem, we feel that it is necessary to doc­ ument a higher level solution roadmap. We call this roadmap the 'Secu­ rity Framework for Route Optimization'. It talks about the architec­ ture that a complete solution has, and the components that are needed. We also discuss factors affecting the need for various components and particular technical solutions for them.</t>
