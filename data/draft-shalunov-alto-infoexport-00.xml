      <t>The ALTO Information Export Service is a simple way to convey ISProuting policy preferences to applications. Applications that coulduse this service are those that have a choice in connectionendpoints. Examples of such applications are peer-to-peer andcontent delivery networks.Applications already have access to great amount of underlyingtopology information. For example, views of the Internet routingtable are easily available at looking glass servers and entirelypractical to download to every client. What is missing is therouting policy information -- what does the local ISP actuallyprefer?This document describes a very simple mechanism that would allow toexport such information to applications. While such service wouldprimarily be provided by the network, i.e., the local ISP, thirdparties could also operate this service.1. Requirements notationThe key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].2. OverviewEach network region can choose to support the ALTO service. (Anetwork region in this context is an Autonomous System, an ISP, orperhaps a smaller region -- the details depend on the mechanism ofdiscovery.)The service works as follows:1. The ISP prepares the ALTO information. This maps some IP prefixes or AS numbers into priority values. Higher priority values indicate higher desirability of the prefix. There is a default treatment for IP numbers that are in none of the prefixes or AS numbers.2. The ISP serializes the information into a sequence of octets (Section 4).3. The application, running on a given host, discovers the resource and fetches the serialized ALTO information (Section 3).4. The application makes use of the information by preferring IP numbers with higher priority (Section 5).The part of the ISP MAY be implemented, to give a few examples thatdo not preclude other implementation options,by running a script connecting to existing equipment, fetchingrouting information, and then generating and uploading therequisite file;by running a database-backed application that is obtains routinginformation from existing equipment and generates the requisitefile dynamically;by modifying the software or hardware of existing equipment tosupport these functions; orby using new equipment for the purpose of operating this networkservice.3. DiscoveryDiscovery per se is out of scope for this document and will behandled separately.The necessary property of discovery is that a client, starting fromnothing on today's Internet that does not yet universally supportglobal-scope multicast and may include NATs, can find a URL thatdescribes the location of the local ALTO service, as configured bythe ISP.Subsequent sections assume that this URL is found. So that maximumnumber of clients can use the ALTO service, the URL schema SHOULD be"http" or "https".</t>
