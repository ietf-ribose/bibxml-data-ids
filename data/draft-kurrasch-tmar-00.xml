      <t>Tele-Media Address Resolution (TMAR) is a scheme for use with internet telephony. The scheme introduces a URL format and protocol that is simple and flexible yet powerful enough to meet most any telecommunication need. The URL takes the form of tmar://caller:password@host:port/path, where path may be written as a directory tree or in E.164 notation. The protocol allows for such features as customized call routing, call load balancing, and firewalls to be implemented within an internet telephony network. This internet-draft contains the requirements, examples, and recommendations for the implementation of this scheme.</t>
