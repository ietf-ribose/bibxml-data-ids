    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the Intent-based Agent Interconnection Protocol (IAIP) operating at the Agent Gateways (AG), which defines the interaction mechanisms between AI Agents (at the Agent Domain) and the AG (at the Interconnection Services Domain). This specification focuses on dynamic interconnection among agents based on semantic intent, rather than static network addressing alone. This protocols defines the mechanisms for agent registration via capability advertisement, Gateway Validation, Intent Resolution and Matching, Routing Decisions and Forwarding, enabling the discovery, selection and dispatching of intent queries based on agent capabilities and task requirements at AG.</t>
