      <t>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) (STD 94, RFC 8949) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. In addition to the binary interchange format, CBOR from the outset (RFC 7049) defined a text-based "diagnostic notation" in order to be able to converse about CBOR data items without having to resort to binary data. RFC 8610 extended this into what is known as Extended Diagnostic Notation (EDN). This document consolidates the definition of EDN, sets forth a further step of its evolution, and is intended to serve as a single reference target in specifications that use EDN. It updates RFC 8949, obsoleting its Section 8, and RFC 8610, obsoleting its Appendix G. It specifies an extension point for adding application-oriented extensions to the diagnostic notation. It then defines two such extensions that enhance EDN with text representations of epoch-based date/times and of IP addresses and prefixes (RFC 9164). A few further additions close some gaps in usability. The document modifies one extension originally specified in Appendix G.4 of RFC 8610 to enable further increasing usability. To facilitate tool interoperation, this document specifies a formal ABNF grammar, and it adds media types. // (This "cref" paragraph will be removed by the RFC editor:) The // present revision -14 is intended to reflect the feedback on -13 as // discussed during IETF 121.</t>
