      <t>This draft defines a bulletin mechanism that conveys time-varying information about a linked resource. It is in a form suitable for use by autonomous user agents monitoring documents for changes in content or for new or changed links. HTML authors can use bulletins to push information back to an interested audience. Bulletins can be text messages of up to 1024 characters. A bulletin has a posting date associated with it and may also have an expiration date, an image, and a link to another resource.</t>
