      <t>BGP flow specification version 1 (RFC5575) describes the distribution of traffic filter policy (traffic filters and actions) which are distributed via BGP to BGP peers to support the following 3 applications: (1) mitigation of Denial of Service (DoS), (2) traffic filtering in BGP/MPLS VPNs, and (3) centralized traffic control for networks with SDN or NFV controllers. A BGP Flow Filter that combines packet filter with time may provide an ability to for these three applications to have a flow filter operate for only a specific time. The traffic filtering and centralized traffic control applications may require user-defined ordering of filters rather than RFC5575's defined order. BGP Flow Specification version 2016 allows for user ordering of flow specifications. This document proposes a new BGP Flow specification filter for BGP Flow Specification 2.</t>
