    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) and JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) serializations with Ascon which is a NIST standard for lightweight cryptography. In 2019, as a part of CAESAR competition, Ascon-128 and Ascon-128a were selected as the first choice for the lightweight authenticated encryption [asconv1.2-caesar]. After, in 2023, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) selected Ascon family of cryptographic algorithms to be the standard for lightweight cryptography [asconv1.2-nist]. In August 2025, NIST Special Publication 800-232 was released, defining Ascon-based lightweight cryptography standards for constrained devices [NIST.SP.800-232]. This recognition makes it particularly interesting to use Ascon with COSE and JOSE structures. This document does not define any new cryptography, only serializations of existing cryptographic systems described in [NIST.SP.800-232].</t>
