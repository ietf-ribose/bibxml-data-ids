      <t>This document defines a tunneling protocol that can be encapsulated in any other protocol. Using authentication tokens multiple tunnels can be created from behind the same NAT. The tokens allow one to identify the sender of the packet thus making it possible to automatically switch over the endpoint. This protocol is intended as an alternative to the proto-41 protocol in use for tunneling IPv6 over IPv4 packets over the internet. Due to the authentication this protocol is especially useful for dynamic non-24/7 endnodes which are located behind NATs and want to use for instance a IPv6 Tunnel Broker. The protocol can carry any payload and thus is not limited to only IPv6 over IPv4 but can also be used for IPv4 over IPv6 and many other combinations of protocols.</t>
