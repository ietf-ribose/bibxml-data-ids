      <t>This document describes an authentication service that uses EAP transported by means of CoAP messages with the following purposes: o Authenticate a CoAP-enabled device that enters a new security domain managed by a domain Controller. o Derive key material to protect CoAP messages exchanged between them, enabling the establishment of a security association between them. o Optionally, to generate key material for other types of Security Associations. Generally speaking, this document is specifying an EAP lower layer based on CoAP, to bring the benefits of EAP to IoT.</t>
