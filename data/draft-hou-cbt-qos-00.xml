    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes extension to the CBT protocol to maintain a multicast tree with user-specified QoS properties. Specifically, it describes enhancements in the member join/leave and state update/refresh procedures to facilitate the deployment of additive (e.g., end-to-end delay bound), multiplicative (e.g., packet loss ratio along a path) and concave (e.g., minimum bandwidth available) QoS. Eligibility tests are devised to verify whether or not a new member can join a multicast tree at adequate QoS, while not violating the QoS received by on-tree members. Management of router state is based on a simple state update and refresh procedure that can be readily integrated with the tree maintenance mechanism that exists in CBT (i.e., echo-requests and echo-replies).</t>
