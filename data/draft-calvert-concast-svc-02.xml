      <t>Concast is a many-to-one best-effort network service that allows areceiver to treat a group of senders as a single entity, in much thesame way that IP multicast allows a sender to treat a group ofreceivers as one. Each concast datagram delivered to a receiver isderived from (possibly many) datagrams sent by different members ofthe concast group to that receiver, according to a 'mergespecification'. Concast allows the semantics of this mergingoperation to vary to suit the needs of different applications. Thisdocument describes the concast service and presents a framework fordefining merge semantics. It also describes the processing ofconcast datagrams by concast-capable routers and hosts. The concastsignaling protocol (CSP), an integral part of the concast service, isspecified in a separate document.</t>
