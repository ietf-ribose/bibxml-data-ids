      <t>Concast is a many-to-one best-effort network service that allows a receiver to treat a group of senders as a single entity, in much the same way that IP multicast allows a sender to treat a group of receivers as one. Each concast datagram delivered to a receiver is derived from (possibly many) datagrams sent by different members of the concast group to that receiver, according to a 'merge specification'. Concast allows the semantics of this merging operation to vary to suit the needs of different applications. This document describes the concast service and presents a framework for defining merge semantics. It also describes the processing of concast datagrams by concast-capable routers and hosts. The concast signaling protocol (CSP), an integral part of the concast service, is specified in a separate document.</t>
