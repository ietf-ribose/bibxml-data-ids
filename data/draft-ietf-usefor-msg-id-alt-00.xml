      <t>[RFC822] and [RFC1036] define so-called 'Message-IDs' that represent a unique identifier for email and netnews messages. A similar identifier is also used by [RFC2045] for the 'Content-ID' label. For each of these protocols, uniqueness of the identifiers generated is more or less essential. Unfortunately, the original Message-ID specification requires that the generator have an own, non-temporary full qualified domain name available, which does not allow hosts that are connected via dialup lines and get dynamically assigned IP addresses (and hostnames) to generate unique IDs offline. This memo provides recommendations for the generation of such IDs without risking non-uniqueness.</t>
