      <t>The UUCP Mapping Project started in the early 1980s as a means tofacilitate the exchange of electronic mail among sites using the UUCPstore-and-forward transport mechanism. This UUCP software, originallypart of the UNIX operating system became available on a variety ofoperating systems and platforms, from large mainframe to small homePC's. This was done by creating a single database of systemsconnected to each other via UUCP and then using path buildingsoftware (such as pathalias) to determine the optimal path from onesystem to another. Email addresses using this system incorporated theuse of the path as part of the address.</t>
