      <t>Wearable devices are among the core technologies for Internet of Things(IoT). Recent advances in wireless communication devices have made itpossible to create a wearable network in and around the human body. Sucha network can be used for diverse applications such as monitoring humanbody activities and personal entertainments. A typical wearable deviceruns on battery power, which is limited and often non-rechargeable.Therefore, a low energy operation environment is desirable. Emergencytraffic management is an important aspect of such a network. Thisdocument describes how an out-of-bound external wake up based onon-demand mechanism can work to successfully transmit emergency trafficin a typical body-centric wearable network (BC-WN).</t>
