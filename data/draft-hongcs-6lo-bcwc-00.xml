    <abstract>
      <t>Wearable devices are among the core technologies for Internet of Things (IoT). Recent advances in wireless communication devices have made it possible to create a wearable network in and around the human body. Such a network can be used for diverse applications such as monitoring human body activities and personal entertainments. A typical wearable device runs on battery power, which is limited and often non-rechargeable. Therefore, a low energy operation environment is desirable. Emergency traffic management is an important aspect of such a network. This document describes how an out-of-bound external wake up based on on-demand mechanism can work to successfully transmit emergency traffic in a typical body-centric wearable network (BC-WN).</t>
