      <t>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is a technique for discovering a set of addresses which two peers can use to communicate, even in the face of topological obstacles such as NATs. Because the topologies in which ICE may be used are complex, a full ICE implementation is also fairly complex. Implementation which will only be deployed in settings where they have public addresses (e.g., SIP-PSTN gateways) can, however, be substantially simpler. This document describes a subset of ICE suitable for such implementations.</t>
