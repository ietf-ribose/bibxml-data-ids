      <t>When using the telnet protocol to talk to a remote device, as one wouldwith RFC 2217, it would be useful to be able to determineif the remote server is active or not. In contrast withthe ''Are You There'' sub-option, the return message is not mixedinto the data stream presented to the user or client program, it issimply passed between the telnet client/server pair.</t>
