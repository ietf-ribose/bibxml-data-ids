      <t>Many devices make use of so-called "Call Home" functionality in order to be managed or updated, or to otherwise establish outbound communication in the face of NATs, firewalls, and mobility. This memo defines call home functionality, discusses the requirement for firewall traversal, some mechanisms used, and security considerations of those mechanisms. Several existing examples will be shown. This memo also contains examples of how one would make SNMP over SSH, NETCONF over SSH, and interactive terminal access call-home protocols.</t>
