      <t>Any operating protocol functions on the basis of a communication stack. While a layered approach towards a comprehensive stack development amends itself very well to division of labour and abstraction of problems, care must be taken to ensure that layers are so designed that they leverage benefits of using one another. In other words, layers should be so designed such that they are highly optimised for usage with one another. An essential feature of pervasive computing will be Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs). The two primary constraints to system design in MANETs are bandwidth and energy. We bring out the essential properties of layers in any general stack which make it highly efficient and practicable. We call this a “stack aware” architecture. We go on to exemplify this with the case of “helper nodes” in a MANET topology, and discuss the potential benefits of having them as a necessary ingredient for routing. We also bring out their significance in every layer of the integrated stack, using the OSI layers as a reference model.</t>
