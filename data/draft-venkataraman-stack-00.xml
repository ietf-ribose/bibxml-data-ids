      <t>Any operating protocol functions on the basis of a communicationstack. While a layered approach towards a comprehensive stackdevelopment amends itself very well to division of labour andabstraction of problems, care must be taken to ensure that layersare so designed that they leverage benefits of using one another.In other words, layers should be so designed such that they arehighly optimised for usage with one another. An essential feature of pervasive computing will be Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs).The two primary constraints to system design in MANETs are bandwidthand energy. We bring out the essential properties of layers in any general stack which make it highly efficient and practicable. We call this a “stack aware” architecture. We go on to exemplify this with the case of “helper nodes” in a MANET topology, and discuss the potentialbenefits of having them as a necessary ingredient for routing. We alsobring out their significance in every layer of the integrated stack,using the OSI layers as a reference model.</t>
