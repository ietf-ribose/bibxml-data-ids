      <t>This document defines an alternate protocol for Internet name resolution, designed as a prototype to facilitate conversation about the evolution or replacement of the Domain Name System protocol. It attempts to answer the question: "how would we design DNS knowing what we do now," on the background of the properties of an ideal naming service described in [I-D.trammell-inip-pins].</t>
