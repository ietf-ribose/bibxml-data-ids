      <t>Data often are aggregated with an initial set of descriptor information, followed by some number of user data portions. This specification formalizes the occurrences of such aggregations as a MIME Multipart Content-type. It is intended that MIME processors which are aware of the Header-Set construct will be able to process the user data portions, even when they do not understand the specific header (or descriptor) information which begins the set.</t>
