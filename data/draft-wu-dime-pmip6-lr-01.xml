      <t>In Proxy Mobile IPv6, packets received from a Mobile Node (MN) by thethe Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) to which it is attached are typicallytunneled to a Local Mobility Anchor (LMA) for routing. The term"localized routing" refers to a method by which packets are routeddirectly by the MAG without involving the LMA. In order to establisha localized routing session between two Mobile Access Gateways in aProxy Mobile IPv6 domain, two tasks must be accomplished:1. The usage of local routing must be authorized for both MAGs and2. The address of the MAG to which the Correspondent Node (CN) is attached must be discoveredThis document specifies how to accomplish these tasks using theDiameter protocol</t>
