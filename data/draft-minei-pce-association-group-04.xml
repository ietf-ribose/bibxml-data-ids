    <abstract>
      <t>This document introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of LSPs in the context of a PCE. This grouping can then be used to define associations between sets of LSPs or between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such as configuration parameters or behaviors), and is equally applicable to the active and passive modes of a stateful PCE as well as a stateless PCE.</t>
