      <t>The United States Government has published guidelines for "NSA Suite B Cryptography" dated July, 2005, which defines cryptographic algorithm policy for national security applications. This document specifies the conventions for using Suite B cryptography in the Bundle Security Protocol (BSP) Since many of the Suite B algorithms enjoy uses in other environments as well, the majority of the conventions needed for the Suite B algorithms are already specified in other documents. This document references the source of these conventions, with some relevant details repeated to aid developers that choose to support Suite B.</t>
