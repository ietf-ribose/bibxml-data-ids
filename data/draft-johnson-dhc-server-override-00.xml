      <t>This memo defines a new suboption of the DHCP relay information option [6] which allows the DHCP relay to specify a new value for the Server-ID option, which is inserted by the DHCP Server. In some cases it is convenient for the DHCP relay to act as the actual DHCP server such that DHCP RENEWAL requests will come to the relay instead of going to the server directly. This gives the relay the opportunity to include the Relay Agent option with appropriate suboptions even on RENEWAL messages. This new relay agent suboption allows the relay to tell the DHCP server what value to use in the Server-ID option [3]. If this suboption is not present, the server should build the Server-ID option in the normal fashion.</t>
