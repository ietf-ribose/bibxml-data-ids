      <t>This memo defines a new suboption of the DHCP relay informationoption [6] which allows the DHCP relay to specify a new value for theServer-ID option, which is inserted by the DHCP Server. In somecases it is convenient for the DHCP relay to act as the actual DHCPserver such that DHCP RENEWAL requests will come to the relay insteadof going to the server directly. This gives the relay theopportunity to include the Relay Agent option with appropriatesuboptions even on RENEWAL messages.This new relay agent suboption allows the relay to tell the DHCPserver what value to use in the Server-ID option [3]. If thissuboption is not present, the server should build the Server-IDoption in the normal fashion.</t>
