      <t>This document describes the fundamental and unique style conventions and editorial policies currently in use for the RFC Series. It captures the RFC Editor's basic requirements and offers guidance regarding the style and structure of an RFC. Additional guidance is captured on a website that reflects the experimental nature of that guidance and prepares it for future inclusion in the RFC Style guide. Guidance provided by this document will not be applied until published as an RFC. Please send your comments about the contents of this document to &lt;rfc-interest@rfc-editor.org&gt;.</t>
