      <t>This draft proposes a traffic engineering framework for multi-layer path networks using dynamic virtual topology configuration capability of GMPLS protocols. The electrical label switched path is routed over the virtual topology built on a set of optical label switched path in multi- layer path networks. The virtual topology is dynamically altered by setting up or tearing down optical label switched paths. Virtual topol- ogy is configured in response to traffic demand change so that conges- tion of the network is mitigated. Utilization of label switched path is measured at ingress node and disseminated with routing protocol extensions for the individual node to decide whether the virtual topol- ogy should be altered or not without centralized coordination.</t>
