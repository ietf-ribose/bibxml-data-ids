      <t>This document specifies a new URI scheme called http+srv which uses aDNS SRV lookup to locate a HTTP server. The http+srv scheme operatesin the same way as an http scheme but instead of the normal DNSlookup that a http scheme would use, it first tries an DNS SRVlookup. This memo also defines a https+srv scheme that operates inthe same was as an https URI but uses DNS SRV lookups.The draft is being discussed on the apps-discuss@ietf.org list.</t>
