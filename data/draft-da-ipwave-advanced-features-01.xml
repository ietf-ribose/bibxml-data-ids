    <abstract>
      <t>For future vehicular networks, some advanced features might be needed to facilitate use cases as platooning, proximity service awareness, autonomous driving and so forth. Thus, this draft intends to present two functions, known as vehicular grouping and socialization, for enabling some future-oriented use cases. These two functions could be built upon cross-layer identifiers, such as MAC, IP, and ID, which also have potential to formulate more value-added services for future vehicular networks.</t>
