      <t>The 'Age' response-header field in HTTP/1.1 [RFC 2068] is intended to provide a lower-bound for the estimation of a response message's age (time since generation) by explicitly indicating the amount of time that is known to have passed since the response message was retrieved or revalidated. However, there has been considerable controversy over when the Age header field should be added to a response. This document explains the issues and provides a set of proposed changes for the revision of RFC 2068.</t>
