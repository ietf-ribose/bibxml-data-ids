      <t>This document describes an authentication service that uses EAP transported employing CoAP messages with following purposes: 1) Authenticate a CoAP-enabled device that enters a new security domain managed by a domain Controller, 2) Derive key material to protect CoAP messages exchanged between them, enabling the establishment of a security association between them, and 3) Optionally, to generate key material for other types of Security Associations. Generally speaking, this document is specifying an EAP lower layer based on CoAP, to bring the benefits of EAP to IoT.</t>
