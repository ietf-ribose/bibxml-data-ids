      <t>In this document the concept of a so-called Driving Policy is pre-sented. A Driving Policy determines the behavior of an AAA server(Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) when it is confrontedwith a specific message type of the AAA protocol. The first partof this document defines the role of a Driving Policy and how itfits into the AAA concept. According to the model presented, themain task of a Driving Policy is to describe which pre-conditionshave to be checked before the corresponding actions, needed tofulfill an incoming AAA request, can be called, and how to dealwith the post-conditions of these actions.
