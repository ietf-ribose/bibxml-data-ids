      <t>In this document the concept of a so-called Driving Policy is pre- sented. A Driving Policy determines the behavior of an AAA server (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) when it is confronted with a specific message type of the AAA protocol. The first part of this document defines the role of a Driving Policy and how it fits into the AAA concept. According to the model presented, the main task of a Driving Policy is to describe which pre-conditions have to be checked before the corresponding actions, needed to fulfill an incoming AAA request, can be called, and how to deal with the post-conditions of these actions. In the second part a grammar is proposed for these Driving Policies accompanied by the necessary comments about the semantics.</t>
