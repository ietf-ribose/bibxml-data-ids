      <t>In certain networks like financial information network (stock/ commodity trading) and enterprises using cloud based applications, Latency (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet loss is becoming a key requirement for path computation along with other constraints and metrics. Latency, Latency-Variation and Packet Loss is associated with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between customers and service providers. [MPLS-DELAY-FWK] describes MPLS architecture to allow Latency (delay), Latency-Variation (jitter) and Packet loss as properties. [OSPF-TE-EXPRESS] and [ISIS-TE-EXPRESS] describes mechanisms with which network performance information is distributed via OSPF and ISIS respectively. This document describes the extension to PCEP to carry Latency, Latency-Variation and Loss as constraints for end to end path computation.</t>
