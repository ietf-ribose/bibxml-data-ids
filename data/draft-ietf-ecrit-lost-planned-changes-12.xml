      <t>This document defines an extension to the Location to Service Translation (LoST) protocol (RFC5222) that allows a LoST server to notify a client of planned changes to location data. This extension is only useful with the validation function of LoST. It is beneficial for LoST validation clients to be aware of planned changes, since at a known future date, previously valid records may become invalid, and new records may become valid. This extension adds an element to the &lt;findService&gt; request to allow a LoST client to request validation as of a specified date. It adds an optional Time-To-Live element to the response, which informs clients of the current expected lifetime of a validation. It also adds a separate interface to a LoST server that allows a client to poll for planned changes. Additionally, this document provides a conventional XML schema for LoST, as a backwards compatible alternative to the RelaxNG schema in RFC5222.</t>
