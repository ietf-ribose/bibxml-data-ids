      <t>TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path perconnection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers. Thesimultaneous use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session wouldimprove resource usage within the network, and thus improve userexperience through higher throughput and improved resilience tonetwork failure.Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiplepaths between peers. This document presents a set of extensions totraditional TCP to support multipath operation. The protocol offersthe same type of service to applications as TCP - reliable bytestream- and provides the components necessary to establish and use multipleTCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.</t>
