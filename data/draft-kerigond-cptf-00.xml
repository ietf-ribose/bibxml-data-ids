    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a protocol extension for connectionless packet transmission, enabling forwarding devices such as routers and switches to insert per-hop arrival timestamps directly into packets during transit. The extension allows receivers and monitoring systems to reconstruct the precise timing and location of delays throughout a packet's network path, improving performance diagnostics for protocols such as UDP, ICMP, multicast, and broadcast.</t>
