      <t>MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork) allows users to form a private wireless network, without existing centralized administrator that support multi-hop communication and low network establishment cost. Recently some interesting work has been published to allow manet node access to the Internet via internet gateway which is placed on the border of manet and the Internet. The Internet gateway has an important role to support global connectivity. This document introduces the management of internet gateway, routing policy and load balancing for the scenario where multiple mobile gateways exist for an ad hoc network.</t>
