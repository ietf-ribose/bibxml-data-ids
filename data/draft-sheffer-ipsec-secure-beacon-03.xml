    <abstract>
      <t>Remote access clients, in particular IPsec-based ones, are heavily deployed in enterprise environments. In many enterprises the security policy allows remote-access clients to switch to unprotected operation when entering the trusted network. This document specifies a method that lets a client detect this situation in a secure manner, with the help of a security gateway. We propose a minor extension to IKEv2 to achieve this goal.</t>
