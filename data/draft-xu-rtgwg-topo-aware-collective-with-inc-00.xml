    <abstract>
      <t>In this document, the mapping mechanism between the logical and physical topology of collective communication is analysed in In- Network Computing(INC) enabled network, as well as the impact of topology-aware collective communication algorithms on INC enabled large-scale computing clusters. Requirements are also proposed to design efficient mapping mechanism between logical and physical topology and topology-aware collective communication algorithms.</t>
