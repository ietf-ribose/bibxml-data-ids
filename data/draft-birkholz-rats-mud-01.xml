      <t>Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) files and the MUD URIs that point to them are defined in RFC 8520. This document introduces a new type of MUD file to be delivered in conjunction with a MUD file signature and/or to be referenced via a MUD URI embedded in other documents or messages, such as an IEEE 802.1AR Secure Device Identifier (DevID) or a CBOR Web Token (CWT). These signed documents can be presented to other entities, e.g., a network management system or network path orchestrator. If this entity also takes on the role of a verifier as defined by the IETF Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) architecture, this verifier can use the references included in the MUD file specified in this document to discover, for example, appropriate reference value providers, endorsement documents or endorsement distribution APIs, trust anchor stores, remote verifier services (sometimes referred to as Attestation Verification Services), or transparency logs. All theses references in the MUD file pointing to resources and auxiliary RATS services can satisfy general RATS prerequisite by enabling discovery or improve discovery resilience of corresponding resources or services.</t>
