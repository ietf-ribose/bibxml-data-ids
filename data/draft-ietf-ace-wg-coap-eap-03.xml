    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies an authentication service that uses the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) transported employing Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) messages. As such, it defines an EAP lower-layer based on CoAP called CoAP-EAP. One of the primer goals is to authenticate a CoAP-enabled device (EAP peer) that intends to join a security domain managed by a domain Controller (EAP authenticator). Secondly, it allows deriving key material to protect CoAP messages exchanged between them based on Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE), enabling the establishment of a security association between them. This document also provides guidelines on how to generate key material for other types of security associations.</t>
