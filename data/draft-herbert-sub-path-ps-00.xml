      <t>This document presents the problem statement and use cases for a sub- path transport layer. A sub-path is a portion of a network path that has localized characteristics that are of interest to an operator to manage. The structure for managing a sub-path is the "sub-path transport layer". A sub-path transport layer can provide transport layer mechanisms, such as reliability and congestion control, over the aggregate of packets traversing the sub-path. Additionally, a sub-path transport layer can provide performance measurements of traffic over a sub-path which in turn can be input to operations and management. The sub-path transport layer implies the possibility that traffic may be subject to two transport layer control loops, that of the sub-path and that of a higher layer transport protocol, any such solution must consider the ramifications of that.</t>
