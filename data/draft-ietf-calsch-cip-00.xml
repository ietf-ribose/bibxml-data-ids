      <t>The Calendaring Interoperability Protocol (CIP) provides a standard mechanism for exchanging events and other information between scheduling systems. This allows users to schedule meetings with anyone else, no matter what scheduling software they use. CIP is one of three standards under development by the Calendaring and Scheduling Working Group of the IETF. The other two are the Core Object Specification (COS), a standard data format for representing scheduled events, and the Calendaring Access Protocol (CAP), a standard mechanism that scheduling user agents may use to access user calendars (analogous to POP).</t>
