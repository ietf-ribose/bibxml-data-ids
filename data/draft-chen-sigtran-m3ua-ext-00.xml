      <t>RFC 4666 defines a protocol for supporting the transport of any SS7 MTP3-User signalling (e.g., ISUP and SCCP messages) over IP using the services of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol. Some parts of the specification are unclear that may lead to misinterpretations that may impair interoperability between different implementations. RFC 4666 doesn't define the application of IPSTP-IPSEP interface. For the signalling network management function, messages and procedures, it needs more contributes. This document provides clarifications and amendments to RFC 4666.</t>
