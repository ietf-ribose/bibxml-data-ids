      <t>In Mobile IPv6 based IEEE 802.16e wireless networks, to reduce authorizing binding latency, the return routability procedure and the binding update &amp; acknowledgement procedure are defined newly with parameters specified by information on candidate networks where the mobile node can be attached newly, and cryptographic functions of authentication and encryption are also defined newly. The care-of address configuration and the authorizing binding are performed before actual handover for candidate networks where the mobile node can be attached newly. Therefore, the proposed mechanism can make fast authorizing binding, which can reduce binding latency between two nodes and thus enhance throughput degradation caused by the bidirectional tunneling.</t>
