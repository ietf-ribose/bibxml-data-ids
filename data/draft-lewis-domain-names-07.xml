      <t>This document researches the origin of the term Domain Name in the Request for Comments document series, documenting that the term did not originate in the documents defining the Domain Name System. The document describes how the term came to be used, how the DNS followed, and surveys the diverse ways Domain Names have been interpreted within various protocols over time. The purpose of this is to give a solid foundation for work on Domain Names across all protocols making use of Domain Names.</t>
