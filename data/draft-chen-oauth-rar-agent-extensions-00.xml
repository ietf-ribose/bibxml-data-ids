    <abstract>
      <t>OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests (RAR), as defined in RFC 9396, provides a mechanism for clients to request fine-grained, structured authorization details. However, in emerging ecosystems of collaborating AI agents and long-running automated tasks, two critical authorization dimensions remain implicit: the required security assurance level of the authorization policy and the strict binding of authorization lifetime to a task's lifecycle. This document extends the "authorization_details" object of RAR by introducing two new members: "policy_context" and "lifecycle_binding". The "policy_context" member allows a client to explicitly request that the authorization be evaluated and granted under a specific policy assurance level, mitigating policy downgrade attacks and enhancing user consent. The "lifecycle_binding" member enables the validity of an authorization grant to be tied directly to the state of an external entity, such as an automated task, ensuring permissions are automatically and immediately revoked upon task completion. These extensions provide a standardized way to achieve more secure, transparent, and context-aware authorization in complex, automated environments.</t>
