      <t>This document outlines the requirements for a set of open IP based protocols enabling seamless mobility across diverse radio access networks. This document begins by stating some architectural tenets upon which the requirements for the OBAST protocol set are based. Furthermore, what the authors currently believe to be the eventual desirable wireless Internet architecture is described. This architecture is shown to enable a common protocol set that we refer to as open base station transport (OBAST).</t>
