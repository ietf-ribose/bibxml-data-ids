      <t>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) has been selected as the basis for establishing peer-to-peer UDP flows between Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC) clients. Using an unmodified ICE implementation in this context enables the use of the web platform as a denial of service platform. The risks and complications arising from this choice are discussed. A modified algorithm for sending ICE connectivity checks from the web platform is described.</t>
