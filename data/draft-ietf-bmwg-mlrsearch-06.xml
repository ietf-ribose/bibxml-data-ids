    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes extensions to [RFC2544] throughput search by defining a new methodology called Multiple Loss Ratio search (MLRsearch). MLRsearch aims to minimize search duration, support multiple loss ratio searches, and enhance result repeatability and comparability. The primary reason for extending [RFC2544] is to address the challenges and requirements presented by the evaluation and testing of software-based networking systems' data planes. To give users more freedom, MLRsearch provides additional configuration options such as allowing multiple shorter trials per load instead of one large trial, tolerating a certain percentage of trial results with higher loss, and supporting the search for multiple goals with varying loss ratios.</t>
