    <abstract>
      <t>Various protocols are deployed in today's networks, such as BGP / ISIS / OSPF etc. Link neighbor state changes and protocol neighbor state changes are the most important network events that need to be processed with the highest priority. In particular, the SDN controller needs to quickly sense the link neighbor and protocol neighbor state change information in the network. Thus, the various policies applied by the SDN controller to the network can quickly match the current state of the network. This document discusses some possible scenarios and the relevant requirements.</t>
