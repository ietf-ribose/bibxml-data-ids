      <t>This memo describes a MIB module that provides a conceptual layer between high-level "network-wide" policy definitions that effect configuration of the Differentiated Services (diffserv) subsystem and the instance-specific information that would include such details as the parameters for all the queues associated with each interface in a system. This essentially provides an interface for configuring differentiated services at a conceptually higher layer than that of the Differentiated Services MIB. [PROPOSED STANDARD]</t>
