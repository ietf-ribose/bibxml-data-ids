    <title>An Access Control Approach for Searching and Listing</title>
    <date year="1991" month="September" day="23"/>
    <abstract>
      <t>This memo defines an extended ACL (Access Control List) mechanism for the OSI Directory. It is intended to meet strong operational requirements to restrict searching and listing externally, while allowing much more freedom within an organization. In particular, this mechanism makes it possible to restrict searches to certain sets of attributes, and to prevent ``trawling'': the disclosure of large organizational data or structure information by repeated searches or lists. This capability is necessary for organizations that want to hide their internal structure, or to prevent dumping of their entire database. This memo describes functionality beyond, but compatible with, that expected in the 1992 X.500 standard.</t>
