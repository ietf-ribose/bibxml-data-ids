      <t>This draft describes the minimal mechanisms required to support secure initial configuration in a device being added to a 6TiSCH network. The goal of this configuration is to set link-layer keys, and to establish a secure session between each joining node and the JCE who may use that to further configure the joining device. Additional security behaviors and mechanisms may be added on top of this minimal framework.</t>
