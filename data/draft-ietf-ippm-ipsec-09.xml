      <t>The One-way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) and Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) security mechanism require that both the client and server endpoints possess a shared secret. Since the currently-standardized O/TWAMP security mechanism only supports a pre-shared key mode, large scale deployment of O/TWAMP is hindered significantly. At the same time, recent trends point to wider Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) deployment which, in turn, calls for mechanisms and methods that enable tunnel end-users, as well as operators, to measure one-way and two- way network performance in a standardized manner. This document describes the use of keys derived from an IKEv2 security association (SA) as the shared key in O/TWAMP. If the shared key can be derived from the IKEv2 SA, O/TWAMP can support certificate-based key exchange, which would allow for more operational flexibility and efficiency. The key derivation presented in this document can also facilitate automatic key management.</t>
