      <t>TCP and other transport-layer protocols are vulnerable to spoofingattacks from off-path hosts. These attacks can be prevented throughthe use of cryptographic authentication. However, it is difficult touse cryptographic authentication in all circumstances. A variety ofobfuscation techniques -- such as initial sequence numberrandomization and source port randomization -- increase the effortrequired of an attacker to successfully guess the packet headerfields which uniquely identify a transport connection. This memoproposes the use of the IPv6 Flow Label field as a random, per-connection nonce value, to add entropy to the set of packet headerfields used to identify a transport connection. This mechanism iseasily implementable, allows for incremental deployment, and is fullycompliant with the rules for Flow Label use defined in RFC 3697.</t>
