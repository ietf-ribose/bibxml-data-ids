      <t>Consider a BGP free core scenario. Suppose the edge BGP speakers PE1,PE2,..., PEn know about a prefix P/m via the external routers CE1,CE2,..., CEm. If the edge router PEi crashes or becomes totallydisconnected from the core, it is desirable for a core router "P"carrying traffic to the failed edge router PEi to immediately restoretraffic by re-tunneling packets originally tunneled to PEi anddestined to the prefix P/m to one of the other edge routers thatadvertised P/m, say PEj, until BGP re-converges. In doing so, it ishighly desirable to keep the core BGP-free while not imposingrestrictions on external connectivity. Thus (1) a core router shouldnot be required to learn any BGP prefix, (2) the size of theforwarding and routing tables in the core routers should beindependent of the number of BGP prefixes,(3) there should be nospecial router (or group of routers) that handles restoring trafficor the need for one router to store the forwarding table of anotherrouter, (4) re-routing traffic without waiting for re-convergencemust not cause loops, and (4) there should be no restrictions on whatedge routers advertise what prefixes. For labeled prefixes, (6) therepairing core router must swap the label stack advertised by thefailed edge router PEi for the prefix P/m with the label stackadvertised for the same prefix by the edge router PEj before re-tunneling the packet to PEj</t>
