      <t>To support IP multicasting in PMIPv6 domain, MULTIMOB WG has issued several proposals including the base solution,dedicated schemes and direct routing which requires all communications to go through the local mobility anchor(LMA),the dedicated server and the native multicasting infrastructure ,respectively. As this can be suboptimal, localized routing (LR) allows multicast source attached to the same or different mobile access gateways(MAG) with mobile node to send multicast data by using localized forwarding or a direct tunnel between the gateways without any dedicated devices or dependence of the native multicasting infrastructure. This document describes multicast routes optimazition mechanisms for localized routing.The MAG and the LMA are the mobility entities defined in the PMIPv6 protocol and act as PIM-SM routers.</t>
