      <t>I-D.ietf-anima-rfc8366bis defines a digital artifact (known as a voucher) as a YANG-defined JSON document that is signed using a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) structure. This document introduces a variant of the voucher artifact in which CMS is replaced by the JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) mechanism described in RFC7515 to support deployments in which JOSE is preferred over CMS. In addition to specifying the format, the "application/voucher- jws+json" media type is registered and examples are provided.</t>
