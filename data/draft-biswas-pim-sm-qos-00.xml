      <t>This document describes a framework for QoS-aware multicast routingbased on enhancements to PIM-SM. This framework has two components:the development of multicast tree computation schemes that accountfor heterogeneous receiver QoS requirements, and the incorporationof QoS capabilities into PIM-SM for establishing computed paths.The choice of PIM-SM is based on its ability to supportreceiver-initiated join, both shared and source-specific trees. Twodecentralized tree computation schemes, TIQM and NUQM, areconsidered in this document, both requiring support from theunderlying unicast routing scheme to acquire link and nodal resourceavailability information. Additionally, TIQM requires completeinformation at each router about the resource allocation in thenetwork for the existing multicast tree. After a brief analysis ofthese two schemes, the incorporation of QoS awareness in PIM-SM withNUQM as its underlying route computation mechanism is presented. Itis shown that with few extensions to its existing control syntaxes,PIM-SM can be successfully used for QoS integration. Finally, a TreeState Update (TSU) mechanism, which can be used for efficient andscalable dissemination of multicast tree state information, isproposed. It is shown that by using the proposed TSU protocol it ispossible to partially alleviate the control overhead of TIQM.</t>
