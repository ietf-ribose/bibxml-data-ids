      <t>This document describes a framework for QoS-aware multicast routing based on enhancements to PIM-SM. This framework has two components: the development of multicast tree computation schemes that account for heterogeneous receiver QoS requirements, and the incorporation of QoS capabilities into PIM-SM for establishing computed paths. The choice of PIM-SM is based on its ability to support receiver-initiated join, both shared and source-specific trees. Two decentralized tree computation schemes, TIQM and NUQM, are considered in this document, both requiring support from the underlying unicast routing scheme to acquire link and nodal resource availability information. Additionally, TIQM requires complete information at each router about the resource allocation in the network for the existing multicast tree. After a brief analysis of these two schemes, the incorporation of QoS awareness in PIM-SM with NUQM as its underlying route computation mechanism is presented. It is shown that with few extensions to its existing control syntaxes, PIM-SM can be successfully used for QoS integration. Finally, a Tree State Update (TSU) mechanism, which can be used for efficient and scalable dissemination of multicast tree state information, is proposed. It is shown that by using the proposed TSU protocol it is possible to partially alleviate the control overhead of TIQM.</t>
