      <t>This document describes the issues and gives examples of typical proxy systems in AAA applications. The purpose of this effort is to set the reference space evaluating and improving AAA protocols, such as the Diameter protocol, currently being reviewed in this WG. This interim version begins to address solutions to some of the issues raised earlier. This document will evolve into an explanation of the issues we are concerned with and the recommended solutions.</t>
