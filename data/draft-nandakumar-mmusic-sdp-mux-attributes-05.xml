      <t>The Session Description Protocol (SDP) provides mechanisms to describe attributes of multimedia sessions and of individual media streams (e.g., Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions) within a multimedia session. In the RTCWeb WG, there is a need to use a single 5-tuple for sending and receiving media associated with multiple media descriptions ("m=" lines). Such a requirement has raised concerns over the semantic implications of the SDP attributes associated with the RTP Sessions multiplexed over a single transport layer flow. The scope of this specification is to provide a framework for analyzing the multiplexing characteristics of SDP attributes. The specification also categorizes existing attributes based on the framework described herein.</t>
