      <t>This memo discusses semantics of communication with IPv6 addresses. This model introduces three address scope classes, node-local, site-local, and global, for both IPv6 unicast and multicast addresses. For a given packet, all addresses in the packet including those in the routing header must be in the same address scope class. Since the sockaddr_in6 address data structure is extended to be able to hold an interface index number, a kernel and applications can exchange interface information. A source address is uniquely determined with the destination address and the outgoing interface. This memo also clarifies packet processing mechanism for the input, forward, and output function.</t>
