      <t>This document specifies the Multicast Synchronization (MSYNC) Protocol. MSYNC is intended to transfer video media objects over IP multicast. Although generic, MSYNC has been primarily designed for transporting HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) objects including manifests/playlists and media segments (e.g., CMAF) according to a HAS protocol such as Apple HLS or MPEG DASH between a multicast sender and a multicast receiver.</t>
