      <t>We compare the service received by TCP and UDP flows when they share either a link or an MPLS traffic trunk. Since traffic trunks allow non shortest path links also to be used, the total network throughput goes up with proper traffic engineering. If UDP and TCP flows are mixed in a trunk, TCP flows receive reduced service as the UDP flows increase their rates. Also, we found that in order to benefit from traffic engineering, MPLS trunks should be implemented end-to-end (first router to last router). If some part of the network is MPLS-unaware, the benefits are reduced or eliminated.</t>
