      <t>We compare the service received by TCP and UDP flows when they shareeither a link or an MPLS traffic trunk. Since traffic trunks allow nonshortest path links also to be used, the total network throughput goesup with proper traffic engineering. If UDP and TCP flows are mixed in atrunk, TCP flows receive reduced service as the UDP flows increase theirrates. Also, we found that in order to benefit from trafficengineering, MPLS trunks should be implemented end-to-end (first routerto last router). If some part of the network is MPLS-unaware, thebenefits are reduced or eliminated.</t>
