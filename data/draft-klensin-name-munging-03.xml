      <t>As one works on internationalization issues for DNS, email, and other protocols, it becomes clear that the various encodings and transformations required, while not intrinsically difficult, can be an impediment to rapid conversion of applications to international form and to rapid prototyping of new applications. This document proposes a new, lightweight, protocol that can be used to make such conversions, rather than incorporating the needed tables and algorithms into each application.</t>
