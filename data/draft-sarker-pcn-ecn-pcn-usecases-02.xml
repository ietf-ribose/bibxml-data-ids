      <t>This document provides an informative overview of possible use caseswhere ECN marking can be used for inelastic traffic. It outlinesbenefits of preserving the ECN support in a PCN domain. As ECNprovides with a simple mechanism for network nodes to inform the endpoints about possible upcoming congestion and resulting packet lossesand delay increase, the scheme can be useful for adaptive real-timemedia applications, thus enabling them to adjust the transmissionrate to avoid quality degradation due to congestion. By showing thebenefits of ECN this memo asks the working group to consider end toend ECN support in PCN domain.</t>
