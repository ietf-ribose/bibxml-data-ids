    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides general information (such as parameter sizes, security assumptions, and targeted security models) on a range of widely studied post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, including Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) and digital signature schemes. The cryptographic schemes described in this document are among those recommended by major security agencies and/or standardization bodies, and are believed to be secure against Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC). The goal of this document is to offer a high-level overview of these schemes and their distinguishing features, to help implementers, protocol designers, standards developers, and policymakers in understanding and selecting appropriate post-quantum cryptographic primitives for use in protocols and systems. By aggregating and presenting this information in a unified format, this document aims to facilitate informed decision-making and interoperability during the migration to post-quantum cryptography, and to encourage consistent practices when evaluating and deploying PQC schemes in cryptographic protocols.</t>
