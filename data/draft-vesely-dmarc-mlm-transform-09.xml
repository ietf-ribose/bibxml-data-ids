      <t>The widespread adoption of Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) led Mailing List Managers (MLM) to rewrite the From: header field as a workaround. This document proposes a method to revert MLM transformations, in order to restore the original From: line after reception. There are two strategies to undo From: rewriting, author-centric, whereby the signing agent takes measures for undoing, and list- centric, whereby the MLM does so. The present method uses the former strategy.</t>
