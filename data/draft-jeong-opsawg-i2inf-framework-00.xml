    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a framework for Interface to In-Network Functions (I2INF) for a user's services involved in both networks and applications. In-Network Functions (INF) include In-Network Computing Functions (INCF) in Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN). They also include In-Network Application Functions (INAF) in Internet-of-Things (IoT) Devices, Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). This document describes an I2INF framework with its components and interfaces to configure and monitor the INFs for the user's services.</t>
