      <t>This document is a collection of technical clarifications to the DNSSEC document set. It is meant to serve as a resource to implementors as well as a repository of DNSSEC errata. This document updates the core DNSSEC documents (RFC4033, RFC4034, and RFC4035) as well as the NSEC3 specification (RFC5155). It also defines NSEC3 and SHA-2 as core parts of the DNSSEC specification.</t>
