      <t>DomainKeys Security Tagging (DOSETA) is a component mechanism that enables development of a security-related service, such as authentication or encryption, with keys based on domain names; the name owner can be any actor involved in the handling of the data, such as the author's organization, a server operator or one of their agents. The DOSETA Library provides a collection of common capabilities, including canonicalization, parameter tagging, and retrieval of self-certified keys. The DOSETA Signing Template affixes a signature to data that is in a "header/content" form. Defining the meaning of the signature is the responsibility of the service that incorporates DOSETA. The signature is validated through a cryptographic signature and querying the signer's domain directly, to retrieve the appropriate public key.</t>
