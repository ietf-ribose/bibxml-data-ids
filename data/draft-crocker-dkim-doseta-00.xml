      <t>DomainKeys Security Tagging (DOSETA) is a component mechanism thatenables development of a security-related service, such asauthentication or encryption, with keys based on domain names; thename owner can be any actor involved in the handling of the data,such as the author's organization, a server operator or one of theiragents. The DOSETA Library provides a collection of commoncapabilities, including canonicalization, parameter tagging, andretrieval of self-certified keys. The DOSETA Signing Templateaffixes a signature to data that is in a "header/content" form.Defining the meaning of the signature is the responsibility of theservice that incorporates DOSETA. The signature is validated througha cryptographic signature and querying the signer's domain directly,to retrieve the appropriate public key.</t>
