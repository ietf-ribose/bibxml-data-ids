      <t>VPLS, as currently defined, has challenges pertaining to the areas of redundancy and multicast optimization. In particular, multi- homing with all-active forwarding cannot be supported and there's no known solution to date for leveraging MP2MP MDTs for optimizing the delivery of multi-destination frames. This document defines an evolution of the current VPLS solution, referred to as Routed VPLS (R-VPLS), to address these shortcomings. In addition, this solution offers several benefits over current VPLS such as: ease of provisioning, per-flow load-balancing of traffic from/to multi-homed sites, optimum traffic forwarding to PEs with both single-homed and multi-homed sites, support for flexible multi-homing groups and fast convergence upon failures. Conventions The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119</t>
