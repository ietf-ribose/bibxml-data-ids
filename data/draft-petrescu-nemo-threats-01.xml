      <t>This document describes security threats related to the network mobility base protocol (NEMO). Threats of Mobile IPv6 for Mobile Hosts are only briefly touched when in need of support of related NEMO threats. The NEMO signalling between MR and HA, as well as the forwarding information at HA and nested mobility configurations are considered to be the main sensitive points of the protocol. Existing tools of Mobile IPv6 protection between MH and HA (IPsec), dynamic routing protocol authentication, NEMO prefix table, ingress filtering checks at HA and tunnel encapsulation limiting are presented as protocol features affording protection against threats. NEMO threats for which there are no protections are briefly mentioned.</t>
