      <t>This document specifies the extensions necessary to set up multi- class diffserv-aware traffic engineered label switched paths (LSPs). A multi-class diffserv-te LSP carries traffic from multiple traffic classes and is set up along a path that satisfies the bandwidth constraints defined for each of the classes it carries.</t>
