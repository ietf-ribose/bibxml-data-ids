    <abstract>
      <t>DKIM [RFC6376] is an IETF standard for the cryptographic protocol to authenticate email at the domain level and protect the integrity of messages during transit. Section 8.6 (https://www.rfc- editor.org/rfc/rfc6376.html#section-8.6) defines a vulnerability called DKIM Replay as a spam message sent through a SMTP MTA DKIM signer, that then is sent to many more recipients, leveraging the reputation of the signer. We propose two Replay Resistant cryptographic domain based protocols that leverage ARC [RFC8617]. The first technique discloses all SMTP recipients as signed RFC822 headers by the sender which allows a receiver to verify this. The second technique defines a SMTP extension that allows both the sender and receiver to participate in signing the message signature. It includes a path building technique that accurately defines the SMTP forwarding path of the message. Both techniques permit a receiver to detect DKIM and ARC replay attacks and other attacks.</t>
