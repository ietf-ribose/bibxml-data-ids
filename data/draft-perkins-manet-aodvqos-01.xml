    <abstract>
      <t>The Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol is intended for use by mobile nodes in an ad hoc network. It offers quick adaptation to dynamic link conditions, low processing and memory overhead, low network utilization, and determines routes between source and destination addresses. To provide quality of service, extensions can be added to the messages used during route discovery. These extensions specify the service requirements which must be met by nodes rebroadcasting a Route Request or returning a Route Reply for a destination. This draft describes how service partners discover routes that can satisfy QoS service conditions by using these extensions.</t>
