      <t>This document recommends IPv6 behavior for Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) routers in Internet-enabled homes and small offices. The CPE Router may be a standalone device. The CPE Router may also be embedded in a device such as a cable modem, DSL modem, cellular phone, etc. This document describes the router portion of such a device. The purpose behind this document is to provide minimal functionality for interoperability and create consistency in the customer experience and satisfy customer expectations for the device. Further, the document also provide some guidance for implementers to expedite availability of IPv6 CPE router products in the marketplace. It is expected that standards bodies other than the IETF developing standards for specific products in this area (e.g. CableLabs eRouter, DSL Forum, Home Gateway Initiative, etc.) may reference this work for basic functionality and provide value-added or linktype- specific customizations and enhancements which are beyond the scope of this document.</t>
