      <t>The current IPv6 Neighbor Discovery specification does not provide semantics for carrying vendor-specific options in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages. With the anticipated wide scale deployment of IPv6 networks, it is useful for organizations and vendors to have the ability to carry organization/vendor specific information in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages. This will facilitate the vendors and organizations to make deployment specific extensions as needed in system deployment. This document defines a new vendor-specific information option that can be carried in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery messages exchanged between IPv6 nodes on a link.</t>
