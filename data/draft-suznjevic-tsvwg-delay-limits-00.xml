      <t>Network delay is one of the main factors which can degrade the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the users of network services. This document surveys a set of recommendations about the maximum latency tolerated by the users of delay-constrained services. Some recommendations already exist for VoIP, but emerging services as e.g. online gaming, have different requirements. Different papers in the literature reporting these constraints are surveyed, and a summary of the latency limits for each service is finally provided.</t>
