      <t>RFC3261 [2] recommends that SIP requests be authenticated using HTTP Digest authentication as defined in RFC2617 [3], and many vendors have successfully added this function to their products. However implementation bugs are still being observed both at interoperability events and in the field. This document provides worked examples of Digest authentication usage in SIP. It is intended to help new SIP implementers, and to provide a common set of test authentication examples against which an implementation may be checked.</t>
