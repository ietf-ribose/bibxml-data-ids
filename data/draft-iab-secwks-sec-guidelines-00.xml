      <t>The 'Security Considerations' section of an RFC is a mechanism via which the authors/editors of an RFC communicate to the reader the security issues (including threats) of the RFC topic and discuss mechanisms for mitigating or eliminating those threats. Each risk reduction mechanism not documented directly in that RFC should cite another RFC or document which describes the risk reduction mechanism.</t>
