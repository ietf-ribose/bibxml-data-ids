      <t>This document describes the framework, messages, and procedures for the Diameter Network address and port translation Control Application. This Diameter application allows per endpoint control of Network Address Translators and Network Address and Port Translators, which are added to networks to cope with IPv4-address space depletion. This Diameter application allows external devices to configure and manage a Network Address Translator device - expanding the existing Diameter-based AAA and policy control capabilities with a Network Address Translators and Network Address and Port Translators control component. These external devices can be network elements in the data plane such as a Network Access Server, or can be more centralized control plane devices such as AAA- servers. This Diameter application establishes a context to commonly identify and manage endpoints on a gateway or server, and a Network Address Translator and Network Address and Port Translator device. This includes, for example, the control of the total number of Network Address Translator bindings allowed or the allocation of a specific Network Address Translator binding for a particular endpoint. In addition, it allows Network Address Translator devices to provide information relevant to accounting purposes.</t>
