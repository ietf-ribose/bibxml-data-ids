      <t>This document investigates the design space for resolution and rendezvous mechanisms for the Host Identity Protocol (HIP.) It identifies and describes specific issues that HIP resolution and rendezvous mechanisms should address. These issues include dependencies on the DNS, lack of support for direct communication based on host identities, lack of a reverse lookup mechanism for host identities, and DNS and node rendezvous. This document does not propose specific resolution and rendezvous mechanisms. Different alternative solutions will be described and discussed in companion documents. These documents should analyze if and to what degree the specific proposals they present address the issues identified here.</t>
