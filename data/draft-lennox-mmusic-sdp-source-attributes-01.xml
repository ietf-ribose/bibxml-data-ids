      <t>The Session Description Protocol provides mechanisms to describe attributes of multimedia sessions and of individual media streams (e.g., Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) sessions) within a multimedia session, but does not provide any mechanism to describe individual media sources within a media stream. This document defines a mechanism to describe RTP media sources, identified by their Synchronization Source Identifiers (SSRCs), in SDP, associate attributes with these sources, and express relationships among sources. It also defines several source-level attributes which can be used to describe properties of media sources.</t>
