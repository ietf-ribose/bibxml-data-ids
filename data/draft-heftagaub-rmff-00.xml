      <t>The RealMedia File Format (RMFF) is designed to be a generic container for streaming media data. This data may then be played back locally or streamed over a network using protocols such as RTSP and RTP. The format is data-independent, allowing any data type to be recorded, manipulated and played back. Note: This document is intended to be informational in nature of what the file format in use by RealNetworks' RealServer and RealPlayer implementations. Though we think that there are a lot of important concepts embodied in this specification, and that it may even make the basis of a ''standard'' file format, this is intended to eventually end up as an Informational RFC.</t>
