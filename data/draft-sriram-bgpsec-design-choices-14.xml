      <t>This document is written to capture the design rationale primarily for the individual draft-00 version of BGPsec protocol specification [I-D.lepinski-bgpsec-protocol-00]. However, where appropriate, the document also provides a brief rationale and/or pointer for design decisions that are reflected in the finalized BGPsec protocol specification [RFC8205]. It lists the decisions that were made in favor of or against each design choice, and presents brief summaries of the arguments that aided the decision process.</t>
