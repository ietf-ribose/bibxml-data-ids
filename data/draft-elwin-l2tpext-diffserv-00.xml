    <abstract>
      <t>L2TP provides layer-2 tunneling over long distances, and a single L2TP session is likely to carry different type of IP packets. Currently, one L2TP session carries only one payload session; for PPP session (payload) the LCP controls the corresponding L2TP session. Assigning one diffserv code point to a L2TP session, as mentioned in [ref-6] can not provide differentiated services for the different kind of IP packets that are tunneled. For example, VoIP and FTP packets, will have to be treated the same in the backbone, even though the intermediate nodes are diffserv capable.</t>
