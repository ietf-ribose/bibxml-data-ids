    <abstract>
      <t>When an interface on a host is initialized, the host transmits Router Solicitations in order to minimize the amount of time it needs to wait until the next unsolicited multicast Router Advertisement is received. In certain scenarios, these router solicitations transmitted by the host might be lost. This document specifies a mechanism for hosts to cope with the loss of the initial Router Solicitations. Furthermore, on some links, unsolicited multicast Router Advertisements are never sent and the mechanism in this document is intended to work even in such scenarios.</t>
