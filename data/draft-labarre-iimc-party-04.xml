      <t>This document is intended to facilitate the multi-protocol management coexistence and interworking for networks that are managed using the ISO/CCITT Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) and networks that are managed using the Internet Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). This document defines the end-to-end security architecture, services, and mechanisms for use with ISO/CCITT-Internet proxies. This document also contains the ISO/CCITT GDMO definition and registration of the SNMP Parties MIB, derived from the Internet SNMP Parties MIB [RFC1447] according to the procedures defined in 'Translation of Internet MIBs to ISO/CCITT GDMO MIBs' [IIMCIMIBTRANS].</t>
