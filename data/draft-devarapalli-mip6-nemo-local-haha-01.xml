      <t>This document describes the use of an Inter Home Agents protocol (HAHA) to achieve Home Agent reliability and load balancing. The protocol allows Home Agents serving the same home link to share the binding cache contents, and switch a mobile node from one home agent to another. It also allows a mobile node to utilize multiple Home Agents simultaneously. A mobile node picks one Home Agent as its primary Home Agent and registers with it. The primary Home Agent synchronizes the binding cache information with other Home Agents. Any of Home Agents can intercept a packet meant for the mobile node and tunnel the packet directly to its current Care-of address.</t>
