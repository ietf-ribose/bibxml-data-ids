      <t>During the last few years, a number of proposals forextensions or improvements to email have run into trouble with aside-effect of mail relaying. In the current Internet Mail model, every SMTP server is required to break strict layering by inserting one or more additional 'trace' headers into the message headers which are actually part of the SMTP payload. Since the headers arealtered in transit, header-signing is not an available option, variousanti-spam and internationalization strategies are infeasible or muchmore complex, and so on. This document proposes to change theInternet mail model to place the in-transit trace information in theenvelope, removing the requirement that relaying systems modify themessage payload.</t>
