    <abstract>
      <t>The protocol described in this document provides the basis for the IP Device Control (IPDC) family of protocols. The IPDC protocols are proposed as a protocol suite, components of which can be used individually or together to perform connection control, media control, and signaling transport for environments where the service control logic is separated from the network access server. Please see the references section for other IPDC documents. According to the framework provided by Cuervo et al [1], the IPDC protocol suite operates between the Media Gateway Controller and the Media Gateway. In terms of previous contributions to the experts of Questions 13-14/16, the corresponding entities are the Call Control and Media Control portions of the H.323 Gateway. The operation of IPDC in the service of H.323 is clarified in a companion contribution entitled 'IPDC Architectural Framework' [3].</t>
