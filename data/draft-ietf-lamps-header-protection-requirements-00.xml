      <t>Privacy and security issues with email header protection in S/MIME have been identified for some time. However, the desire to fix these issue has been expressed in the IETF LAMPS Working Group only recently. The existing S/MIME specification is likely to be updated regarding header protection. Several LAMPS WG participants expressed the opinion that whatever mechanism will be chosen, it should not be limited to S/MIME, but also applicable to PGP/MIME. This document describes the problem statement, generic use cases, and requirements. Additionally it drafts possible solutions to address the challenge. Finally some best practices are collected.</t>
