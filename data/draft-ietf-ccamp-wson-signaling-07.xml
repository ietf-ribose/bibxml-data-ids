    <abstract>
      <t>This memo provides extensions to Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) signaling for control of wavelength switched optical networks (WSON). Such extensions are applicable in WSONs under a number of conditions including: (a) when optional processing, such as regeneration, must be configured to occur at specific nodes along a path, (b) where equipment must be configured to accept an optical signal with specific attributes, or (c) where equipment must be configured to output an optical signal with specific attributes. In addition this memo provides mechanisms to support distributed wavelength assignment with choice in distributed wavelength assignment algorithms. These extensions build on previous work for the control of lambda and G.709 based networks. This document updates [RFC6205] as make it applicable to WSON-LSC capable equipment.</t>
