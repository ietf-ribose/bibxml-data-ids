      <t>As part of document metadata, RFCs can reference existing RFC that they update or obsolete. While obsoleting is well-understood (replace the obsoleted RFC in its entirety), updating has more nuances because the updated RFC remains valid. This document contains some clarifications about how to handle updating in a way that makes it easier for readers to understand how the original and the updating RFC relate. Note to Readers This draft should be discussed on the wgchairs mailing list [1]. Online access to all versions and files is available on github [2].</t>
