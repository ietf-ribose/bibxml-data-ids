      <t>The real world use of ABFAB-based technologies requires that any identity to be used to authenticate be configured on the ABFAB- enabled client device. Achieving this requires software on that device (either built into the operating system or a standalone utility) that will interact with the user, managing their identity information and identity-to-service mappings. All designers of software to fulfil this role will face the same set of challenges. This document aims to document these challenges with the aim of producing well-thought out UIs with some degree of consistency between implementations.</t>
