      <t>This document defines the Web of Agents (WoA), a minimal JSON based description format and invocation convention that allows HTTP hosts to advertise AI agents and for clients to invoke those agents in a uniform way. A WoA document is typically served from a well known location on an HTTP origin and uses JSON Schema to describe agent inputs and outputs. WoA does not define a discovery protocol itself but is designed to be used as a host level primitive by higher level discovery systems.</t>
