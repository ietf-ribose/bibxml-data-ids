      <t>This document defines a framework and basis for the IANA registration of parameters defined in the ITU V.150 recommendation, which addresses the transmission of modem signals over IP. This includes both modem passthrough and modem relay operation. As a framework document, this internet draft leaves the details of the modem-over-IP (MoIP) protocols and formats to the ITU V.150 recommendation. Since the V.150 recommendation is work in progress by ITU SG16/Q11, registration of these parameters is contingent upon its impending ratification. Although these parameters are meant for use in text-based control protocols such as SDP, equivalent reformulations are planned for non-text protocols such as ITU H.245.</t>
