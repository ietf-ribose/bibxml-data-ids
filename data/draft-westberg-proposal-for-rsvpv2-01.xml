      <t>The Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVPv1) has been on the standards track within the IETF for a number of years. During that time, the level of vendor support and deployment has been relatively slow, despite the desire of many to deploy technology to deliver services with different levels of quality of service (QoS) to their customers. The reasons for this are arguably well-understood and documented and are not the focus of this memo. This memo seeks to initiate a dialog about the design of a new version of RSVPv1, which we call RSVPv2. The RSVPv2 framework could use the combination of two concepts. The concept of ALSP (Application Layer Signaling Protocol) and the concept of Common Signaling Transport Protocol (CSTP). This memo outlines the motivation for doing this work and provides design guidelines and specifications for the development of the RSVPv2 ALSP. RSVPv2 ALSP is an ALSP type that can be a part of the RSVPv2 framework.</t>
