      <t>This memo describes a standard way to store traceroute measurementsand related metrics. To better address the traceroute measurementsstoring issue, the authors first of all give a definition of thetraceroute tool, describe the tool itself as well as its parametersand the default values on the most common operating systems and theoutput results that can be stored. Afterwards, the commoninformation model with the base elements of the traceroutemeasurement storing is defined dividing the information elements intwo semantically separated groups (configuration elements and resultsones). Moreover an additional element is defined to relateconfiguration elements and results ones by means of a common uniqueidentifier. On the basis of the information model a data model isthen proposed in order to actually store the traceroute measurements.Finally considerations on how to extract relevant metrics related totraceroute measurements are given.</t>
