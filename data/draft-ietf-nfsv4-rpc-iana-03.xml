      <t>Network services based on RPC [RFC1831] use program numbers ratherthan well known transport ports to permit clients to find them, anduse authentication flavor numbers to define the format of theauthentication data passed. The assignment of RPC program numbersand authentication flavor numbers is still performed by SunMicrosystems, Inc. This is inappropriate for an IETF standardprotocol, as such work is done well by the Internet Assigned NumbersAuthority (IANA). This document defines how IANA will maintain andassign RPC program numbers and authentication flavor numbers.</t>
