      <t>CoAP is being standardised as an application level REST-based protocol. A single CoAP message is typically encapsulated and transmitted using UDP or DTLS as transports. These transports are optimal solutions for CoAP use in IP-based constrained environments and nodes. However compelling motivation exists for understanding how CoAP can operate with other transports, such as the need for M2M communication using non-IP networks, improved transport level end-to- end reliability and security, NAT and firewall traversal issues, and mechanisms possibly incurring a lower overhead to CoAP/HTTP translation gateways. This draft examines the requirements for conveying CoAP packets to end points over such alternative transports. It also provides URI solutions for representing CoAP resources over alternative transports.</t>
