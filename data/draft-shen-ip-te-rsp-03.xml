      <t>This document describes a mechanism to establish traffic engineering IP tunnels. Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) is used as a signaling protocol described in Generalized Multi-Protocol Lable Swithing (GMPLS) RSVP Traffic Engineering technology, but no MPLS forwarding capability is assumed on the switched path. IP routing is used to switch IP traffic trunks. A simple GMPLS RSVP Traffic Engineering extension is needed to setup the IP Route Switched Paths (RSPs).</t>
