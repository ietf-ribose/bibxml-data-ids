      <t>This document lays out a set of requirements related to role-based authorization for the Session Initiation Protocol. While numerous authentication mechanisms are described in the base SIP specification, role-based authorization provides information used to make policy decisions based on the attributes of a participant in a session. This approach provides a richer framework for authorization, as well as allow greater privacy for users of an identity system.</t>
