      <t>This document proposes an update to the advice given in RFC 3819. Subsequent research has altered understanding of buffer sizing and queue management. Therefore this document significantly revises the previous recommendations on buffering. The advice applies to all packet buffers, whether in network equipment, end hosts or middleboxes such as firewalls or NATs. And the advice applies to packet buffers at any layer: whether subnet, IP, transport or application.</t>
