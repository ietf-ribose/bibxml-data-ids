      <t>A number of mechanisms have been proposed to support differentialQualiy of Service for packets in the Internet. DiffServ is anexample of such a mechanism. However, the level of assurance thatcan be provided with DiffServ without substantial over-provisioningis limited. Pre-Congestion Notification (PCN) uses path congestioninformation across a PCN region to enable per-flow admission controlto provide the required service guarantees for the admitted traffic.While admission control will protect the QoS under normal operatingconditions, an additional flow termination mechanism is necessary tocope with extreme events (e.g. route changes due to link or nodefailure).In order to allow the PCN mechanisms to work it is necessary for IPpackets to be able to carry the pre-congestion information to the PCNegress nodes. This document explores different ways in which thisinformation can be encoded into IP packets. This document does notchoose the encoding but provide guidance and recommendation based ondifferent criteria. This document also provides a historical traceof the consideration on different encoding alternatives for Pre-Congestion Notification.</t>
