      <t>This document is designed to help organizations in their use of 4- octet AS numbers in the future by checking the possibility of interaction between 2-octet AS numbers and 4-octet AS numbers for each scenario, based on the compatibility of heterogeneous equipment used in the actual network related to 4-octet AS numbers, and by verifying the interoperability of networks specified in each scenario - before using 4-octet AS numbers, before applying 4-octet AS numbers, as well as the influence on service traffic at the time of interaction.</t>
