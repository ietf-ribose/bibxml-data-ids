      <t>LEDBAT is an experimental delay-based congestion control algorithm that attempts to utilize the available bandwidth on an end-to-end path while limiting the consequent increase in queueing delay on the path. LEDBAT uses changes in one-way delay measurements to limit congestion that the flow itself induces in the network. LEDBAT is designed for use by background bulk-transfer applications; it is designed to be no more aggressive than TCP congestion control and to yield in the presence of any competing flows when latency builds, thus limiting interference with the network performance of the competing flows.</t>
