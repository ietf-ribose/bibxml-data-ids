      <t>Provider Provisioned VPNs (PPVPNs) need a tunneling mechanism and a means to automatically discover VPN membership and signal these tunnels. This draft elaborates the use of L2TP as the tunneling mechanism, and defines extensions to L2TP to handle VPN membership discovery to leverage PPVPNs. Additional AVPs are defined, and their behaviour are explained. The solution presented here is applicable for both L3 VPNs and L2 VPNs.</t>
