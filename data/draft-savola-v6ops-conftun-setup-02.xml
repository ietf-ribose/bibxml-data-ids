      <t>This memo describes a set of operational procedures, a UDPencapsulation for configured tunnels, and one implementationmechanism to provide a very simple and straightforward way to easilymanage IPv6-over-IPv4 configured tunnels between an ISP and acustomer. The configured tunnels work even if the IPv4 addresseschange dynamically, or are private addresses; the procedure providesat least a /64 prefix per customer and requires no administrativeset-up. NAT traversal is also supported.</t>
