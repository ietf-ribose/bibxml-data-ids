      <t>This memo describes a set of operational procedures, a UDP encapsulation for configured tunnels, and one implementation mechanism to provide a very simple and straightforward way to easily manage IPv6-over-IPv4 configured tunnels between an ISP and a customer. The configured tunnels work even if the IPv4 addresses change dynamically, or are private addresses; the procedure provides at least a /64 prefix per customer and requires no administrative set-up. NAT traversal is also supported.</t>
