      <t>This document specifies the MyClerk Virtual File System (VFS), a distributed storage system designed for family networks. The VFS provides end-to-end encrypted, redundant storage across heterogeneous nodes using adaptive chunking and Reed-Solomon erasure coding [REED-SOLOMON]. Metadata synchronization uses Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) [CRDT] with a hybrid LWW-Register and OR-Set approach. The system supports tiered storage, automatic health monitoring with self-healing capabilities, and federation between separate family installations. It is designed to be accessible to non-technical users while providing enterprise-grade data durability.</t>
