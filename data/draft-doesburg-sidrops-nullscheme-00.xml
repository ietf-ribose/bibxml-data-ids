      <t>This document specifies the Null Scheme for use in Signed Objects in the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI). The Null Scheme is a niche signature scheme that can replace the redundant and costly use of actual digital signatures from so-called "one-time-use" key pairs in Signed Objects. The Null Scheme has as public key the digest of the message to be signed, and the signature is always empty. When a Null Scheme public key is the subject of a Signed Object's one-time- use End-Entity (EE) certificate, it establishes a secure binding between the issuer of the EE certificate and the message to be signed. This is cheaper in terms of size and verification time than using a real signature scheme, while providing the same security guarantees.</t>
