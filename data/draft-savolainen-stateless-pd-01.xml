      <t>This document describes an automatic and stateless IPv6 prefixdelegation solution for IPv6-only and dual-stack access networks.The solution builds on automatic delegation mechanism defined by 6RD,but is suitable for IPv6-only networks, including those that have notdeployed stateful DHCPv6. The described stateless approachessentially exchanges the complexity of the stateful prefixdelegation to increased consumption of IPv6 address space and lessflexible properties.</t>
