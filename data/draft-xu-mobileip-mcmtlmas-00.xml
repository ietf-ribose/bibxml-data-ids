      <t>This document introduces a Local Mobility Agent selection algorithm in the Localized Mobility Management of Mobile IPv6. This proposed selection algorithm locates a Local Mobility Agent to register a visiting mobile node in a foreign domain where multiple Local Mobility Agents are deployed. The domain architecture, Local Mobility Agent selection and registration procedures are specified. This algorithm selects Local Mobility Agent on a per mobile node basis and reduces registration delay. It also helps to distribute the registration load to all the Local Mobility Agents, avoiding overcrowding at a particular one.</t>
