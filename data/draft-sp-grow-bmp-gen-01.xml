      <t>This document defines a new BMP message type: the Generic Event Notification (GEN).

The BMP GEN message enables operators and automated systems to receive detailed context for operational events, such as policy triggers, administrative interventions, and state management notifications (e.g., RIB view unmonitor events).</t>
