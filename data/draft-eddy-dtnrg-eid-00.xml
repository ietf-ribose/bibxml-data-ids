      <t>The architecture for Delay Tolerant Networking includes a type of address called an Endpoint Identifier. This document describes some of the remaining issues regarding Endpoint Indentifiers, and how they can be configured and used in bundle forwarding. These either imply directions for future work or highlight clarifications that should be made in the current architecture and protocol documents.</t>
