      <t>The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) provides support formultiple authentication methods. This document defines the TunneledExtensible Authentication Method (TEAM), which provides an encryptedand authenticated tunnel based on transport layer security (TLS) thatencapsulates EAP authentication mechanisms. TEAM uses TLS to protectagainst rogue authenticators, protect against various attacks on theconfidentiality and integrity of the inner EAP method exchange andprovide EAP peer identity privacy. TEAM also provides support forchaining multiple EAP mechanisms, cryptographic binding betweenauthentications performed by inner EAP mechanisms and the tunnel,exchange of arbitrary parameters (TLVs), and fragmentation andreassembly.</t>
