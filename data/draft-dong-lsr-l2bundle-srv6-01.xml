      <t>There are deployments where the Layer-3 interface on which IGP operates is a Layer-2 interface bundle. Existing IGP advertisements only support advertising link attributes of the Layer-3 interface. If entities external to IGP wish to control traffic flows on the individual physical links that comprise the Layer-2 interface bundle, link attribute information about the bundle members is advertised by IGP extensions for Layer-2 (L2) bundle. When Segment Routing over IPv6 (SRv6) is used with Layer-2 interface bundle to control traffic flows on the individual member links, the SRv6 SIDs which represent the Layer 2 member links of the L2 bundle needs to be advertised in IGP. This document proposes the IGP extensions to advertise the SRv6 SIDs of the Layer 2 (L2) bundle member links.</t>
