      <t>The growth in mobile terminal access to the Internet has been one of the greatest growth areas in the past year. Indeed the so-called 3rd generation mobile networks being designed are premised upon Internet services and protocols. Both mobility and wireless access bring with them unique requirements that needs to be addressed within the Internet community such as address space and limited access bandwidth. This document is a synthesis of a yearlong study of mobile operators and mobile ISPs to crystallise these unique requirements.
