      <t>The traceroute program has proven very useful and has been extensively used in the Internet for measurement and debugging purposes. However, it only shows the originator to target path and gives no indication on the reverse path. Source routing may sometimes be used to find it, but it's very often disable by intermediary routers. Another problem occurs when packets do not follow the same routes: traceroute outputs are very difficult to read. Other solutions has been proposed to record the route taken by an IPv4 packet. Originally, IPv4 contains an option in which every intermediary router can add its address [RFC791]. Unfortunately, the limitation in size imposed by the options design of IPv4 limits its use to 9 routers. In [RFC1393] another strategy was proposed. An new IPv4 option was created. When a router receives a packet containing this option, it generates a ICMP Echo message to the source. This technique couldn't be widely deployed in IPv4 because it needed a change in every single router to be efficient. These two methods create less traffic on the network and are more accurate, since they give the real route taken by packets and are less sensitive to fluttering. The IPv6 deployment could be the opportunity to widely deploy a new traceroute mechanism based on those two methods. We propose to combine the two previous methods by defining a new hop-by-hop option and a new ICMP message type to record the direct path from the originator to the target and the reverse path from the target to the originator.</t>
