    <abstract>
      <t>Network administrators typically enforce Quality of Service (QoS) policies according to Traffic Conditioning Agreement (TCA) with their providers. The enforcement of such policies often relies upon vendor-specific configuration language. Both learning of TCA, either thru TCA documents or via some other out-of-band method, and translating them to vendor specific configuration language is a complex, often manual, process and prone to errors. This document specifies an optional transitive attribute to signal TCA parameters in-band, across administrative boundaries (considered as Autonomous Systems (AS)), thus simplifying and facilitating some of the complex provisioning tasks in situations where BGP is available as a routing protocol.</t>
