      <t>Applications differ with respect to whether or not they need IP session continuity and/or IP address reachability. Networks providing the same type of service to any mobile host and any application running on the host yields inefficiencies. This document describes extensions to the DHCPv6 protocol to enable mobile hosts to indicate the required mobility service type associated with a requested IP address, and networks to indicate the type of mobility service associated with the allocated IP address in return.</t>
