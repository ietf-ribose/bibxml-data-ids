      <t>The Simple Agent Communication Protocol (SACP) is an application protocol designed to facilitate communication of data and facts between software agents over the Internet. While designed with agents in mind, it is also suited to applications where the agent metaphor can be applied, such as autonomous processes, or to systems which might be accessed by agents, such as databases or directories. Applications which need to transmit or receive machine-readable data, or structured information that is stored hierarchically, are ideally suited to SACP.</t>
