      <t>This document is published to capture the rationale for the changes introduced in RFC NNNN (RFC Editor: please replace NNNN with the RFC number of [I-D.ietf-iasa2-trust-update]), Update to the Process for Selection of Trustees for the IETF Trust. At the time RFC NNNN was published, IETF administrative structure changes ("IASA 2.0") had an impact on the IETF Trust because members of the IETF Administrative Oversight Committee (IAOC) IAOC, which was being phased out, had served as Trustees of the IETF Trust. This document provides background on the past IETF Trust arrangements, explains the effect of the rules in the founding documents during the transition to the new arrangement, and provides a rationale for the update.</t>
