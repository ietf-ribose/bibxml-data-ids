      <t>This Internet-Draft proposes elimination of end-to-end IP addressesfrom the Internet, presenting a stronger embodiment of the end-to-endprinciple by elevating the end-to-end aspects of connectivity androuting above the network to an operating system-like framework thatimplements virtual network addressing and efficient translation toswitched paths, obviating end-to-end addressing at all levels. Theresulting flexibility would allow, for example, piecewise transitionto IPv6 and full access to the existing Internet for the emergingwireless services without allocating new addresses.</t>
