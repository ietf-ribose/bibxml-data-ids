      <t>This Internet-Draft proposes elimination of end-to-end IP addresses from the Internet, presenting a stronger embodiment of the end-to-end principle by elevating the end-to-end aspects of connectivity and routing above the network to an operating system-like framework that implements virtual network addressing and efficient translation to switched paths, obviating end-to-end addressing at all levels. The resulting flexibility would allow, for example, piecewise transition to IPv6 and full access to the existing Internet for the emerging wireless services without allocating new addresses.</t>
