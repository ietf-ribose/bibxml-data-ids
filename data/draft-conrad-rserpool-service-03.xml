      <t>RSerPool [1] is a framework to provide highly available services between clients and servers. This is achieved by grouping servers into pools, each with an identifier and pooling policy. Three classes of entities are defined: Pool Users (clients), Pool Elements (servers), and Name Servers. This memo defines the services provided by this framework to upper layer protocols and applications for Pool Users and Pool Elements. It describes the service primitives that the framework provides and describes example scenarios.</t>
