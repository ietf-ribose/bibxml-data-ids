    <abstract>
      <t>In Web PKI, certificate path construction and validation are crucial security review processes. At present, there are many Internet browser manufacturers around the world. With the change of security practices and the development of technology, the certificate validation process in Internet browser industry is relatively messy, including various private implementations of manufacturers. It is a typical patching improvement method, and the implementation of process functions is relatively arbitrary. This document provides a technical guide for certification path validation of web server certificates during Internet SSL/TLS protocol communication for Web PKI, including the basic path verification process, as well as reference procedures, guidance and suggestions for input, initialization, and basic certificate processing in the verification process. This document is applicable to the development and application of Internet browsers, as well as other similar digital certificate authentication systems requiring SSL/TLS security protocol secure communication.</t>
