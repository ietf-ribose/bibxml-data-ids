    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides an information encoding for the optical impairment characteristics of optical network elements for use in path computation and optical path impairment validation. This encoding is based on ITU-T defined optical network element characteristics as given in ITU-T recommendation G.680 and related specifications. This encoding is intentionally compatible with a previous impairment free optical information encoding used in optical path computations and wavelength assignment. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [RFC2119].</t>
