      <t>Applications such as SRv6 TE may require to collect detailed performance data on SR paths. Existing in-situ OAM techniques incur encapsulation and header overhead issues. This document describes a method based on Postcard-based Telemetry with Packet Marking for SRv6 on-path OAM, which avoids the extra overhead for encapsulating telemetry-related instruction and metadata in SRv6 packets.</t>
