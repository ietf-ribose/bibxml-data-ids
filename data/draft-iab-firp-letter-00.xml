      <t>The Draft Report of the U.S. Federal Internetworking Requirements Panel (FIRP) has been posted and comments requested. Individual responses from ISOC/IETF members are encouraged. However, it is desirable to have a coordinated response from the Internet Society, IAB, and IESG. Note that responses are due by February 18. This Internet Draft is a draft letter from Vint Cerf, Christian Huitema, and Phill Gross and is meant to be that coordinated response.</t>
