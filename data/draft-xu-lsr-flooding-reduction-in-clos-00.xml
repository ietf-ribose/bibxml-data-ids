      <t>For a given OSPF (or ISIS) router within the CLOS topology, it would receive multiple copies of exactly the same LSA (or LSP) from multiple OSPF (or ISIS) neighbors. In addition, two OSPF (or ISIS) neighbors may send each other the same LSA (or LSP) simultaneously. The unnecessary link-state information flooding wastes the precious process resource of OSPF (or ISIS) routers. This document proposes extensions to OSPF (or ISIS) so as to reduce the OSPF (or ISIS) flooding within such CLOS networks. The reduction of the OSPF (or ISIS) flooding is much beneficial to improve the scalability of CLOS networks.</t>
