      <t>CoAP is a RESTful application protocol for constrained nodes and networks. This specification provides a simple extension for CoAP, to inform a CoAP server of the maximum time that a CoAP client will wait a response to its request. A CoAP server can use this header to ensure that a timely response is generated. Note Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to core@ietf.org.</t>
