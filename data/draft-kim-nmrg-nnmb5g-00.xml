      <t>This document is derived from the intelligent artificial intelligent (AI) network and autonomous security, network management intend-based technology to ensure constant security quality in B5G. SOAR (Security Orchestration Automation and Response) is needed by autonomous security and network management to optimize an adaptive B5G network. The purpose of this document is to confirm whether the requirements are reflected to future users and to develop and identify user provided by useful decision how to develop the system. This document also covers the user requirements for autonomous security and intend-based network management to ensure constant security quality on B5G.</t>
