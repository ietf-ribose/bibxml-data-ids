      <t>This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to deliver fabric service for users within a data center network. This model is intended to be instantiated by management system. It provides an abstraction of services for a fabric network to be used by users. However it is not a configuration model used directly onto network infrastructures. It should be used combining with such as fabric topology data model defined in [I-D.zhuang-i2rs-yang-dc-fabric-network-topology] with specific fabric topology information to generate required configuration onto the related network elements to deliver the service.</t>
