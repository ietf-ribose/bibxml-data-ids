      <t>The third generation, 3G, wireless networks that enable high-speed data transfer are now being introduced. Internet access is one of the most important applications of such networks. TCP is one of the key technologies that enable Internet applications for such networks. A number of TCP optimization techniques have been studied to enhance the performance of TCP transmission for various wireless environments.</t>
