      <t>During handover from one access router to another, a wireless mobile node may need to have a certain amount of state information passed from the Previous-Router to the new one. This document specifies extensions to Mobile IPv6 which allow additional control structures enabling the transfer of the necessary state during handovers. This state transfer allows the applications running on the mobile node to operate with reduced latency, minimal disruption, and reduced packet loss during handovers.</t>
