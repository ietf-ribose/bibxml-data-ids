      <t>This memo specifies modifications required to Mobile Access Gatewayand Local Mobility Anchor to integrate NAT64 with Proxy Mobile IP sothat mobile nodes (MN) receiving network-based mobility managementusing Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) can communicate with IPv4 onlyservers. The protocol is based on local mobility anchors maintaininga table similar to NAT64 and linking it to the binding cache. Thechanges include better keepalive management in order to preservebattery on the mobile node as well as multicast support for NAT64integrated into the current multicast support scheme in Proxy MobileIPv6 so that IPv6 only mobile nodes can receive multicast data fromIPv4 only content providers.</t>
