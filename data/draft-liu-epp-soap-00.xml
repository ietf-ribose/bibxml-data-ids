      <t>This memo documents a proposal for exchanging EPP (Extensible Provisioning Protocol) messages as XML documents between a client and a server via SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), using the SOAP request/response communication model. An EPP message is encapsulated in the SOAP Body, while the EPP session information is encoded in the SOAP header, enabling EPP session-oriented messaging over the SOAP protocol. It is designed to work on top of any transport bindings defined for SOAP, taking advantage of the variety of SOAP software tools and environments available for web services.</t>
