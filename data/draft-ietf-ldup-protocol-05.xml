      <t>The protocol described in this document is designed to allow one LDAP server to replicate its directory content to another LDAP server. The protocol is designed to be used in a replication configuration where multiple updateable servers are present. Provisions are made in the protocol to carry information that allows the server receiving updates to apply a total ordering to all updates in the replicated system. This total ordering allows all replicas to correctly resolve conflicts that arise when LDAP clients submit changes to different servers that later replicate to one another. All protocol elements described here are LDAPv3 extended operations and controls. LDAPv3 is described in RFC 2251 [LDAPv3]. Some LDAPv3 extended operations and controls described here are LDAPv3 extended operations used to group related operations. The protocol elements used for grouping are described in LDAPv3: Grouping of Related Operations [GROUPING]. Certain terms used in this document are defined in the document 'LDAP Replication Architecture' [ARCHITECTURE].</t>
