    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies alternative Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) Block-Wise transfer options: Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options. These options are similar to, but distinct from, the CoAP Block1 and Block2 Options defined in RFC 7959. Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options are not intended to replace Block1 and Block2 Options, but rather have the goal of supporting Non-confirmable messages for large amounts of data with fewer packet interchanges. Also, the Q-Block1 and Q-Block2 Options support faster recovery should any of the blocks get lost in transmission.</t>
