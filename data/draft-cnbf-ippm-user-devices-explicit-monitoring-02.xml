      <t>This document describes a methodology to monitor network performance exploiting user devices. This can be achieved using the Explicit Flow Measurement Techniques, protocol independent methods that employ few marking bits, inside the header of each packet, for loss and delay measurement. User devices and servers, marking the traffic, signal these metrics to intermediate network observers allowing them to measure connection performance, and to locate the network segment where impairments happen. In addition or in alternative to network observers, a probe can be installed on the user device with remarkable benefits in terms of hardware deployment and measurement scalability.</t>
