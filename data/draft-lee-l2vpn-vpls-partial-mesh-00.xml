      <t>Some standard network devices may not be able to communicate with each other as if they were connected to a common LAN segment in the event of partial mesh connectivity in a VPLS. Unless this problem is addressed, the deployment of VPLS may eventually be limited to sites not using link state routing or bridges.</t>
