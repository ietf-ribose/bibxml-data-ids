      <t>Users are often connected to Internet with very few outgoing ports available, such as only port 80 and 443 over TCP. This situation has many implications on designing, deploying and using IETF protocols, such as encaspulating protocols within HTTP, difficulty to do traffic engineering, quality of service, peer-to-peer, multi-channel protocols or deploying new transport protocols. This document describes the situation and its implications.</t>
