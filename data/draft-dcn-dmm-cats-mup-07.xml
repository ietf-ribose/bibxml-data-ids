    <abstract>
      <t>The document [I-D.draft-ietf-dmm-mup-architecture] describes the Mobile User Plane (MUP) architecture for Distributed Mobility Management. The proposed architecture converts the user mobility session information from the control plane entity to an IPv6 dataplane routing information. When there are multiple candidate instances located at different location to serve an user request, the MUP Provider Edge (PE) might prioritize the closest service location. However, the closest routing path might not be the optimal route. This document discusses how the mentioned MUP architecture can be leveraged to set up dataplane routing paths to the optimal service instance location with the assistance of computing-aware traffic steering capabilities. For each session request, based on the up-to- date collected computing and network information, the MUP controller can convert the session information to the optimal route.</t>
