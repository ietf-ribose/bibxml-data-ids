      <t>The current IP Multicast model appears to achieve a level ofsimplicity by extending the IP unicast addressing model (historicallythe classful A,B, and C net numbers) from the mask and longest matchschemes of CIDR, with a new classful address space, class D. Therouting systems have been also built in a deceptively simple way inone of three manners - either broadcast and prune (DVMRP, Dense ModePIM), destination list based tree computation (MOSPF) or singlecentered trees (current sparse mode PIM and CBT). The multicastservice creates the illusion of a spectrum that one can 'tune in to',as an application writer. Due to this view, many have seen themulticast pilot service, the Mbone, as a worldwide Ethernet, wheresimple distributed algorithms can be used to allocate 'wavelengths'and advertise them through 'broadcast' on a channel (the sessiondirectory), associated with a spectrum.</t>
