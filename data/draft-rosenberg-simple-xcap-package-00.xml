      <t>This specification defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) event package for finding out about changes to documents managed by the Extensible Markup Language (XML) Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP). XCAP allows a client to manipulate XML documents on a server which contain configuration information for application protocols. Multiple clients can potentially access the same document, in which case the other clients would like to be notified of a change in the document made by another. This event package allows a client to do that.</t>
