      <t>The Service Location Protocol (SLP) allows clients to discover services with little or no prior configuration. SLP can be used to advertise services of any kind through the use of URLs. However, SLP uses URLs for two purposes: as a LOCATOR (indicating the location of the service) and as an IDENTIFIER (used for subsequent operations on a service, such as registration, deregistration and looking up attributes.) Confounding these two functions in one object leads to certain problems. The serviceid: scheme separates identification from location, eliminating these problems.</t>
