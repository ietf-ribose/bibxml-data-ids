      <t>This paper is an introduction to terms and principles of policy-based network configuration management that is based on work in the IETF. A generic model for the realization of policy-based network configuration management is presented based on these terms. The last portion, and focus of the paper, examines the current work of the SNMP Configuration Working Group in the IETF and maps that work to the previously defined terms and model.</t>
