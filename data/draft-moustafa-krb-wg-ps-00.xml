      <t>This document presents the problem of authentication andauthorization in distributed environments constituted by severalusers communicating with application servers and communicating witheach others. Each user in this environment can also play the role ofan application provider.Imagine a large music event where the provided network infrastructureis enhanced with network storage equipment to allow visitors toaccess content relating to the bands playing at the events, such asrecorded video of previous performances, supplementary audio andvideo material relevant to the bands playing, etc. Certain contentis, however, not necessarily available to everyone under the sameconditions. Instead access control is applied before the full rangeof audio, and video material can be accessed. Other content, such aspreviews, might be offered for free. How can such authentication,and authorization infrastructure be made available with minimalconfiguration complexity for a temporary event like a music festival?This document describes a problem statement based on the attempt touse Kerberos and lists a couple of requirements for potentiallyneeded Kerberos extensions.</t>
