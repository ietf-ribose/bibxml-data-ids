      <t>This Internet-Draft considers efficient key management for encrypted multicast traffic in large groups, where the group size and dynamics have a significant impact on the network load. We consider the life cycle key management costs of a multicast connection, and show for a Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) how member pre-registration and periodic admission reduces the initialization cost, and how the optimum outdegree of a hierarchical tree varies with the expected member volatility and rekey factor.</t>
