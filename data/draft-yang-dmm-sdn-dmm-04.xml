      <t>DMM is a mobility protocol which has mobility functions to solve the existing problems in the current centralized ones. However, when a mobile node moves to another anchor, the previous flow is forwarded by the previous router. For this reason, the routing optimization could be an issue. This draft proposes a routing optimization method in distributed anchor architecture. In this draft, we applied the SDN concept to DMM architecture for routing optimization.</t>
