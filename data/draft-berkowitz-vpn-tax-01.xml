      <t>Most useful networking ideas involve some level of abstraction. Virtual private networks (VPN) map an abstraction of an user-defined interface onto an infrastructure. Multihoming strategies are virtualizations in the infrastructure [Berkowitz multihome] that should be invisible to the VPN. Proprietary definitions of VPNs proliferate in the marketplace, to the confusion of end users. This memorandum proposes a taxonomy which can describe a variety of VPN models. It does not recommend any specific model, but suggests a consistent way of describing specific VPNs. This document differs from some other working papers that go more deeply into the VPN mechanisms. In contrast, this document is focused on user requirments.</t>
