      <t>The Policy-Enabled Path Computation Framework [PCE-POLICY] introduced the use of the Policy Core Information Model (PCIM), [RFC3060], as a framework for supporting path computation policy within the context of the Path Computation Element (PCE)-Based Architecture, [RFC4655]. This document defines the Path Computation Policy Information Model (PCPIM), which provides the specifics of using PCIM as the method for supporting path computation policy. PCPIM includes classes that model constraints, conditions, actions, variables and values associated with supporting path computation policy. While PCPIM was conceived to operate within the path computation element (PCE)-based architecture, it can be applied to any path computation methodology.</t>
