      <t>This memo proposes a way of transporting NETCONF over WebSocket protocol. Web-based applications are increasing with the advancement of Web technologies and emergence of cloud computing. Management systems that support browser-based interface are getting common. It's natural to expect network devices to have browser-based managemaent interface. Currently, however, few network management protocols support the transportation over HTTP. Although NETCONF[RFC6241] was defined to be sent over SOAP/HTTPS[RFC4743], it can not realize notification mechanism[RFC5277] over SOAP/HTTPS since HTTP lacks bi-directional capabilty. But now, WebSocket protocol, the update of HTTP with bi-directional capability, is available[RFC6455]. This memo describes the way NETCONF is sent over WebSocket protocol.</t>
