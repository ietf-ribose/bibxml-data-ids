      <t>This document presents a high-level design for an End-Middle-End (EME) signaling protocol called NUTSS (which stands for NAT, URI, Tunnel, Signaling, STUN). While high-level, this document tries to be detailed enough that the EME RG can have a meaningful debate about its pros and cons and possible alternatives. The main attribute of NUTSS is that it couples together both path-coupled and path- decoupled signaling.</t>
