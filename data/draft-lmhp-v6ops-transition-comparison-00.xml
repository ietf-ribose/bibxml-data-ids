      <t>Several IPv6 transition technologies can be used to provide IPv4-as- a-service (IPv4aaS) to the customers, while the ISPs have only IPv6 in their access and or core network. All these technologies have their advantages and disadvantages. Depending on several various conditions and preferences, different technologies may prove to be the most appropriate solution. This document examines the five most prominent IPv4aaS technologies considering several different aspects in order to provide network operators with an easy to use guideline for selecting the technology that suit their needs the best.</t>
