      <t>Multipath TCP relies on the existence of multiple paths at the end- systems typically provided through different IP addresses obtained by different ISPs. While this scenario is certainly becoming increasingly a reality (e.g. mobile devices), currently most end- systems are single-homed (e.g. residential broadband customers). This memo describes mechanisms to make multiple paths available to multipath TCP via autoconfiguration that are not available at the end-systems but somewhere within the network.</t>
