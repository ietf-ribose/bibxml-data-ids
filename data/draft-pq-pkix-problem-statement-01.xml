      <t>With the widespread adoption of post-quantum (PQ) cryptography will come uncertainty about the strength of cryptographic primitives. For example; when will RSA and ECC fall? Are Lattice schemes as strong as we believe? The cryptographic community is calling for hybrid schemes that combine classic and post-quantum crypto in ways that remain strong so long as at least one of the algorithms used remains strong. This document defines the problem statement for digital signatures in PKIX-like protocols, and gives an overview of the general families of solutions.</t>
