      <t>RFC 6040 on "Tunnelling of Explicit Congestion Notification" made the rules for propagation of ECN consistent for all forms of IP in IP tunnel. This specification extends the scope of RFC 6040 to include tunnels where two IP headers are separated by a shim header that cannot stand alone.</t>
