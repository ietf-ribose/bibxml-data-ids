      <t>Public 4over6 is a stateful transition mechanism which assigns public IPv4 address to CPE/host and uses IPv4-in-IPv6 tunnel. It doesn't involve CGN as in DS-lite and reduces the mapping scale on the Concentrator to per-subscriber level. This document describers deployment models for Public 4over6, and the deployment considerations of the Public 4over6 architecture.</t>
