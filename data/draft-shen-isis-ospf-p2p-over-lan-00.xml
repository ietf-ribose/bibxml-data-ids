    <abstract>
      <t>Two different circuit types are commonly used by link state routing protocols: point-to-point and broadcast. It is important to identify the correct circuit type in forming adjacency with neighbors, in flooding link state database packets, in representation of the circuit subnet. This document describes a simple mechanism to treat the broadcast media as point-to-point connection from IP routing protocol point of view if there are only two devices on the LAN media.</t>
