      <t>Two different circuit types are commonly used by link state routingprotocols: point-to-point and broadcast. It is important to identifythe correct circuit type in forming adjacency with neighbors,in flooding link state database packets, in representation of thecircuit subnet. This document describes a simple mechanism to treatthe broadcast media as point-to-point connection from IP routingprotocol point of view if there are only two devices on the LANmedia.</t>
