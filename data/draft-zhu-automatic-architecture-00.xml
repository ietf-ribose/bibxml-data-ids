      <t>Firmware update is one of the key features for all Internet of Things(IoT) Devices. Incentives of firmware update is to fix bugs, upgrade configurations, add new services from constained devices to connected vehicles. The IETF SUIT working group is focusing on defining a firmware update solution that will be usable on Class 1 devices as well as more capable devices with existing mechanisms. This document provides an firmware update architechture, that aims at helping build a secure, automatic and interoperable IoT firmware update mechanism.</t>
