      <t>This document describes how IP unicast can be efficiently implemented among routers belonging to the same area of a routing domain, where the connectivity is provided by a legacy ATM network as defined by the ATM Forum or ITU. This proposal is designed to be complementary to IP multicast solutions such as the one described in [1].</t>
