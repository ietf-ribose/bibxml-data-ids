      <t>The purpose of PAWS (Protect Against Wrapped Sequence numbers), defined in RFC1323, is to protect a TCP connection against old duplicate segments from the same connection. There is a possibility, however, that PAWS may discard valid reordered segments. This memo proposes a modification to PAWS to solve this problem.</t>
