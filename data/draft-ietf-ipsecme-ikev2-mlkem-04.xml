    <abstract>
      <t>NIST standardized ML-KEM, a new key encapsulation mechanism, which can be used for quantum-resistant key establishment. This draft specifies how to use ML-KEM by itself or as an additional key exchange in IKEv2 along with a traditional key exchange. These options allow for negotiating IKE and Child SA keys which are safe against cryptographically relevant quantum computers.</t>
