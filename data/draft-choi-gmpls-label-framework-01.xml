      <t>Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) extends the MPLS control plane to encompass packet switching, time-division, lambda and fiber switching. The new forms of label which used in GMPLS to deal with the widening scope of MPLS into the optical and time domain are collectively referred to as a 'Generalized Label'. In this draft for extending MPLS label specification [5], we describe the concept and characteristics of Generalized Label for GMPLS. We also discuss the format and considerations for label encoding. Particularly we present the necessity of mapping rule at ingress and egress switching interface where data flows with label of a different granularity are merged into the aggregated data flow of large bandwidth.</t>
