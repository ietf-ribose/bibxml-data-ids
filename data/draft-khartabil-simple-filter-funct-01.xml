      <t>The SIP event notification framework describes the usage of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) for subscriptions and notifications of changes to a state of a resource. The document does not describe a mechanism of how filtering of event notification information can be achieved. This document describes the operations a subscriber performs in order to define filtering rules, how to handle responses to subscriptions carrying filtering rules, and how to handle notifications with filtering rules applied to them. The document also describes how the notifier behaves when receiving such filtering rules and how a notification is constructed. The format of the filter is outside the scope of this document.</t>
