      <t>In an emergency services environment a Location Information Server(LIS) receives requests from end hosts, SIP proxies or Public SafetyAnswering Points (PSAPs). When receiving these requests a LIS has toperform a location determination procedure that depends on thespecific network deployment. In any case, an interation with othernetwork elements is needed, particularly with AAA servers, that storeinformation about the current attachment of the end host.This document descirbes a Diameter application, called DiameterParameter Query, which allows a Location Information Server tointeract with a Diameter server to obtain information needed for thelocation determination procedure. The style of the describedDiameter application offers flexibility for different deployments.</t>
