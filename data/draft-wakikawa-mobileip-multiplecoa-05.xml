      <t>According to the current Mobile IPv6 specification, a mobile node mayhave several Care-of Addresses, but only one, termed the primaryCare-of Address, can be registered with its home agent and thecorrespondent nodes. However, for matters of cost, bandwidth, delay,etc, it is useful for the mobile node to get Internet access throughmultiple access media simultaneously, in which case multiple activeIPv6 Care-of Addresses would be assigned to the mobile node. We thuspropose Mobile IPv6 extensions designed to register multiple Care-ofAddresses bound to a single Home Address instead of the sole primaryCare-of Address. For doing so, a new identification number must becarried in each binding for the receiver to distinguish between thebindings corresponding to the same Home Address. Those extensionsare targeted to NEMO (Network Mobility) Basic Support as well as toMobile IPv6.</t>
