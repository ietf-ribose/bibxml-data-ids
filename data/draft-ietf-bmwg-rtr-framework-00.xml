      <t>This memo discusses and proposes a framework for the development of IPperformance benchmarking methodologies in the case of systems under test(SUT) running IETF routing protocols. The intent of this document is tofacilitate the use of existing metrics developed by the BMWG and otherworking groups. This will be accomplished by specifying routerconfiguration and state parameters and characterizing their effect on IPpacket forwarding in terms of these existing metrics. The terms definedin this memo will be used in addition to terms defined in RFCs 1242,2285, and 2544 and 2761. This memo is a product of the BenchmarkingMethodology Working Group (BMWG) of the Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF).</t>
