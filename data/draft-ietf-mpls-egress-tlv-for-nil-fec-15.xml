    <abstract>
      <t>The MPLS ping and traceroute mechanisms, as described in [RFC8029] and the related extensions for Segment Routing (SR) defined in [RFC8287], is highly valuable for validating control plane and data plane synchronization. In certain environments, only some intermediate or transit nodes may have been upgraded to support these validation procedures. A straightforward MPLS ping and traceroute mechanism allows traversing any path without validating the control plane state. [RFC8029] supports this mechanism with the Nil Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC). The procedures outlined in [RFC8029] is primarily applicable when the Nil FEC is used as an intermediate FEC in the label stack. However, challenges arise when all labels in the label stack are represented using the Nil FEC. This document introduces a new Type-Length-Value (TLV) as an extension to the existing Nil FEC. It describes MPLS ping and traceroute procedures using the Nil FEC with this extension to address and overcome these challenges.</t>
