      <t>The scope of this draft is regarding the VPLS solutions - it describes commonalities and differences among different VPLS solutions in terms of distributed and non-distributed access topologies. The metrics used for comparison are derived from [L2VPN- METRICS] and [L2VPN-FRMK]. The current VPLS solutions that are taken in consideration are: GVPLS [GVPLS], DTLS [DTLS], and VPLS/HVPLS [VPLS-MPLS]. This list of solutions is not exhaustive; other solutions may be taken into account in future versions of this draft.</t>
