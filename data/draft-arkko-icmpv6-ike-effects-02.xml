      <t>The ICMPv6 protocol provides many functions which in IPv4 were eithernon-existent or provided by lower layers. IPv6 architecture alsomakes it possible to secure all IP packets using IPsec, even ICMPv6messages. IPsec architecture has a Security Policy Database thatspecifies which traffic is protected, and how. It turns out that thespecification of policies in the presence of ICMPv6 traffic is hard,particularly with ICMPv6 packets related to Neighbor Discovery.Sound looking policies may easily lead to loops: The establishment ofsecurity requires Neighbor Discovery messages which can not be sentsince security has not been established yet. The purpose of thisdraft is to inform system administrators and IPsec implementors inwhich manner they can handle the ICMPv6 messages. Commonunderstanding of the way that these messages are handled is alsonecessary for interoperability, in case vendors hardcode such rulesin to products.</t>
