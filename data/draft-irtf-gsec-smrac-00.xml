      <t>This document seeks to provide a solution to secure the multicastedge, in particular the 'last-hop' of the multicast between multicastedge routers and hosts within a network. In this document, weproposed a simple and light-weight solution to prevent an illegalhost from pulling the multicast distribution tree into the host'snetwork when no other legal hosts exists in that same network.</t>
