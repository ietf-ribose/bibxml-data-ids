      <t>Over the last six years the IETF has developed a number of protocols that are expected to be useful for localized mobility management (LMM), both for IPv4 and IPv6. All of these protocols were designed as extensions to Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6. However, more recently, the IESG has approved the formation of the NETLMM WG, which aims to develop a network-based localized mobility management protocol. This memo discusses the impacts of a network-based mobility management protocol on the Internet and the IETF. The aim of this memo is to generate discussion in this area in order to better critique the network-based approach and show its impacts.</t>
