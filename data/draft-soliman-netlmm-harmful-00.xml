      <t>Over the last six years the IETF has developed a number of protocolsthat are expected to be useful for localized mobility management(LMM), both for IPv4 and IPv6. All of these protocols were designedas extensions to Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6. However, more recently,the IESG has approved the formation of the NETLMM WG, which aims todevelop a network-based localized mobility management protocol. Thismemo discusses the impacts of a network-based mobility managementprotocol on the Internet and the IETF. The aim of this memo is togenerate discussion in this area in order to better critique thenetwork-based approach and show its impacts.</t>
