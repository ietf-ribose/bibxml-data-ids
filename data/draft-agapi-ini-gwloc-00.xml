    <abstract>
      <t>The development of IP to PSTN gateways has made it possible for users of the two disparate networks to place 'telephone' calls between the two networks with little effort. Users placing calls from an IP network to the PSTN network must choose a gateway to act as a bridge between the two networks. Selection of a gateway can be based on any number of criteria, such as price, codecs, version, billing, etc. In this draft we propose a gateway location service for this purpose. The gateway location service protocol is an instantiation of the Service Location Protocol that has been modified to run in a wide area network across many administrative domains.</t>
