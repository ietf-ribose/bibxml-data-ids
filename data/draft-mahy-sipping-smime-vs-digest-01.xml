      <t>Digest authentication (as defined in RFC2617) is used in SIP(RFC3261) for user authentication, and less frequently for messageintegrity of MIME bodies carried in SIP. Various members of the IETFsecurity community have periodically suggested that Digest should bedeprecated in favor of the SIP use of S/MIME (RFC2633), support forwhich was recently introduced in RFC3261. The author seeks clarityfrom the IETF security community on behalf of the SIP community aboutthe feasibility and possible benefits of using S/MIME instead ofDigest in one or both of these applications.</t>
