      <t>This document defines the requirements for Drone Remote Identification Protocol (DRIP) Working Group protocols and services to support Unmanned Aircraft System Remote Identification (UAS RID). Objectives include: complementing external technical standards as regulator-accepted means of compliance with UAS RID regulations; facilitating use of existing Internet resources to support UAS RID and to enable enhanced related services; and enabling verification that UAS RID information is trustworthy (to some extent, even in the absence of Internet connectivity at the receiving node).</t>
