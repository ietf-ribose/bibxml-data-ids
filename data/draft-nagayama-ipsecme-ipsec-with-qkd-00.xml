      <t>Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a mechanism for creating shared,secret, random bits. This document describes extensions to the IKEv2protocol to use random bits created via QKD as keys for IPsec. TheDiffie-Hellman key agreement mechanism is replaced with QKD. The useof QKD-generated keys with standard IPsec will extend the lifetime ofprivacy guarantees for IPsec-protected data: future technologicaladvances that break Diffie-Hellman key exchange will not disclosedata until such time as the encryption algorithm used for the IPsectunnel is broken.</t>
