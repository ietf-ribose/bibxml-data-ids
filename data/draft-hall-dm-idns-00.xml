      <t>The principle intention of this specification is to facilitate the deployment of a completely internationalized domain name syntax and service which new protocols, applications and host systems can use, but without disrupting the existing infrastructure. Towards that end, this document describes a series of elective encapsulation services and protocol extensions which cumulatively allow internationalized domain names to be stored and transmitted in the existing DNS message and within application data streams, according to the compliance level of the participating systems.</t>
