      <t>This document defines requirements for standards specifications for energy management. The requirements defined in this document concern monitoring functions as well as control functions. Monitoring functions include identification of energy-managed devices and their components, monitoring of their power states, power inlets, power outlets, actual power (the instantaneous power, as opposed to the demand, which is an averaged power), power attributes, received energy, provided energy, and contained batteries. Control functions serve for controlling power supply and power state of energy-managed devices and their components. This document does not specify the features that must be implemented by compliant implementations but rather features that must be supported by standards for energy management.</t>
