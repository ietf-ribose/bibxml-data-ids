    <abstract>
      <t>Considering movement characteristics of mobile users, the authors have proposed a kind of soft-handoff-supporting motion-prediction- and-QoS-negotiation-based fan-shaped flexible resource reservation mechanism, which can provide QoS guarantees to mobile user effectively. The signaling overhead for handoff gets effective control by reverse rerouting mechanisms, being much advantageous than partial rerouting and complete rerouting. Combining the above two mechanisms, soft handoff can be guaranteed and high resource utilization can be attained in the mobile wireless Internet. Simulation has shown the proposed mechanisms are both efficient and effective.</t>
