    <abstract>
      <t>This draft describes a generalized IP handoff model that supports edge mobility such as that encountered in cellular systems and Internet roaming. The model is mobile-controlled and network- constrained. The model is generic in that it permits both planned and unplanned handoff (i.e. proactive and reactive) and supports both make-before-break and break-before-make link layers. It also supports movement within and between technologies, as well as within and between domains. Finally, it is -equally applicable to routed mobility and to tunneled mobile IP-based mobility.</t>
