      <t>This draft describes a generalized IP handoff model that supportsedge mobility such as that encountered in cellular systems andInternet roaming. The model is mobile-controlled and network-constrained. The model is generic in that it permits both plannedand unplanned handoff (i.e. proactive and reactive) and supportsboth make-before-break and break-before-make link layers. It alsosupports movement within and between technologies, as well as withinand between domains. Finally, it is -equally applicable to routedmobility and to tunneled mobile IP-based mobility.</t>
