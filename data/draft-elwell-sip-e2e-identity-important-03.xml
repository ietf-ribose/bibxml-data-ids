      <t>This document surveys existing mechanisms in the Session InitiationProtocol (SIP) for identifying and authenticating the source of a SIPrequest (or caller identification). It describes how identificationand authentication are not always end-to-end and the problems thatthis can lead to, particularly since media security based ontechniques such as DTLS-SRTP is dependent on end-to-end authenticatedidentification of parties.This work is being discussed on the sip@ietf.org mailing list.</t>
