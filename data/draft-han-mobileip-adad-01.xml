      <t>This document proposes to automatically allocate a care-of IPv6addresses (CoA) for the use of mobile nodes that want to be fasthandovered. Each access router maintains 'Passive Proxy Cache' ofwhich each address is in advance generated and tested for itsuniqueness by the access router. Also, the access router acts as'Passive Proxy' for an address reserved in 'Passive Proxy Cache' inorder not to affect the destination cache and neighbor cache of itsneighbor nodes and not to disturb the normal CoA configuration procedure of the nodes which do not obey this draft. During L3 handover, a mobile node, which obeys this draft, requests one of the duplication-free addresses reserved by its target access router. After successfully acquiring the address, the mobile node assigns iton its interface which attaches to the new link, without the RFC 2461DAD. Consequently, the proposed scheme can completely take off the DAD procedure and hence the time involved in the exsting L3 handoverschemes</t>
