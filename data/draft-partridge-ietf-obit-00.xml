      <t>The primary purpose of this memo is to remember substantial contributors to the Internet Engineering Task Force who have passed away in the year 2025. Some substantial contributors who died in prior years are also recognized. This memo is NOT a general memorial notice for the broader Internet community. Rather it is centered on persons who made notable contributions to IETF. This memo is NOT the product of any IETF or IRTF working group. It is published in the Independent RFC Stream consistent with guidelines in RFC4846.</t>
