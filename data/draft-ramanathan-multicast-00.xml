      <t>We discuss the issue of multicasting in Nimrod. We identify the requirements that Nimrod has of any solution for multicast support. We compare existing approaches for multicasting within an internetwork and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, as an example, we outline the mechanisms to support multicast in Nimrod using the scheme currently being developed within the IETF - namely, the Protocol Indpendent Multicast (PIM) protocol.</t>
