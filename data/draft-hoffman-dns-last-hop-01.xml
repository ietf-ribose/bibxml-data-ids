      <t>DNS queries from one resolver to an upstream resolver are often runover connections with no protection of any kind. The stub resolversthat initiate queries for an application are ofte called "last-hop",and their queries go to trusted recursive resolvers. The connectionbetween last-hop resolvers and their upstream resolver is currentlysusceptible to both malicious and unintentional alteration thatprevents the querying resolver from being sure that the results itreceives are valid. Some middleboxes can prevent a stub resolver,even one that does DNSSEC validation, from getting enough informationto validate a response. Further, a non-validating stub resolver issusceptible to active attacks in which the results are purposelyaltered.The protocol described in this document provides a method to avoidthese problems and thus make resolution significantly more secure.This protocol can be used between any two DNS resolvers, but thefocus of this document is on last-hop resolvers.</t>
