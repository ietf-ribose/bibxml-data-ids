    <abstract>
      <t>This document introduces a fast rerouting architecture for enhancing network resilience through rapid failure detection and swift traffic rerouting within the programmable data plane, leveraging in-band network telemetry and source routing. Unlike traditional methods that rely on the control plane and face significant delays in traffic rerouting, the proposed architecture utilizes a white-box modeling of the data plane to distinguish and analyze packet losses accurately, enabling immediate identification for link failures (including black- hole and gray failures). By utilizing real-time telemetry and SR- based rerouting, the proposed solution significantly reduces rerouting times to a few milliseconds, offering a substantial improvement over existing practices and marking a pivotal advancement in fault tolerance of datacenter networks.</t>
