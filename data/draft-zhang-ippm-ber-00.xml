    <abstract>
      <t>Networks may experience transmission bit errors due to various factors, such as poor fiber quality, thereby corrupting packets. Merely measuring the end-to-end bit error rate makes it difficult to locate the exact link wich poor quality. Therefore, a measurement method is needed to collect bit error rate information along the entire path to locate the specific linke with poor quality. This document extends IOAM with a new Trace-Type and "Interface Bit Error Rate" field to collect the interface error rate along the path. This new Trace-Type is applicable to Pre-allocated Trace, Incremental Trace, and Direct Exporting Option-Type.</t>
