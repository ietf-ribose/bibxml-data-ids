      <t>The Proxy Mobile IPv6 supports a mobile node to perform inter- technology handover as well as multihoming. However the inter- technology handover requires the new interface to use the same network prefix with the old one and all the IP address/prefix at the old interface are removed. These requirements disable multihoming function which requires different network prefixes for different interfaces. In this Internet draft we address this problem and suggest the necessary changes in PMIPv6 operations to support a mobile node to perform multihoming as well as seamless inter technology handover with virtual interface.</t>
