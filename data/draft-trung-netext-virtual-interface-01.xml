      <t>The Proxy Mobile IPv6 supports a mobile node to perform inter-technology handover as well as multihoming. However the inter-technology handover requires the new interface to use the samenetwork prefix with the old one and all the IP address/prefix at theold interface are removed. These requirements disable multihomingfunction which requires different network prefixes for differentinterfaces. In this Internet draft we address this problem andsuggest the necessary changes in PMIPv6 operations to support amobile node to perform multihoming as well as seamless intertechnology handover with virtual interface.</t>
