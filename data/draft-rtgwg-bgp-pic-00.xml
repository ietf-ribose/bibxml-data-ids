      <t>In the network comprising thousands of iBGP peers exchanging millionsof routes, many routes are reachable via more than one path. Giventhe large scaling targets, it is desirable to restore traffic afterfailure in a time period that does not depend on the number of BGPprefixes. In this document we proposed a technique by which trafficcan be re-routed to ECMP or pre-calculated backup paths in atimeframe that does not depend on the number of BGP prefixes. Theobjective is achieved through organizing the forwarding chains in ahierarchical manner and sharing forwarding elements among the maximumpossible number of routes. The proposed technique achieves prefixindependent convergence while ensuring incremental deployment,complete transparency and automation, and zero management andprovisioning effort</t>
