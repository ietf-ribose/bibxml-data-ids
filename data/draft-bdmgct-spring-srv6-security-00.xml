    <abstract>
      <t>SRv6 is a traffic engineering, encapsulation, and steering mechanism utilizing IPv6 addresses to identify segments in a pre-defined policy. While SRv6 uses what appear to be typical IPv6 addresses, the address space is treated differently, and in most (all?) cases. A typical IPv6 unicast address is comprised of a network prefix, host identifier, and a subnet mask. A typical SRv6 segment identifier (SID) is broken into a locator, a function identifier, and optionally, function arguments. The locator must be routable, which enables both SRv6 capable and incapable devices to participate in forwarding, either as normal IPv6 unicast or SRv6. The capability to operate in environments that may have gaps in SRv6 support allows the bridging of islands of SRv6 devices with standard IPv6 unicast routing. As standard IPv6 addressing, there are security considerations that should be well understood that may not be obvious.</t>
