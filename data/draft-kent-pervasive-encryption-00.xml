      <t>This document was prepared as part of the IETF response to concerns about "pervasive monitoring" as articulated in [I-D.farrell-perpass- attack]. It begins by exploring terminology that has been used in IETF standards (and in academic publications) to describe encryption and key management techniques, with a focus on authentication vs. anonymity. Based on this analysis, it propose a new term, "pervasive encryption" (PE) to describe a goal for IETF security protocols, one countermeasure to pervasive monitoring.</t>
