      <t>Secure electronic mail can provide authentication of the source of mail and confidentiality for its contents. These features are becoming increasingly important as the Internet grows exponentially and email is increasingly used for critical, sensitive, and confidential communications. In addition, authentication can make mail filtering more effective and ubiquitous encryption indirectly makes all mail more secure be defeating traffic analysis based on distinctions between encrypted and non-encrypted mail and defeating bulk searching through insecure mail. However, use of secure mail is not widespread due to the problems of key distribution and lack of migration to secure mail enabled user agents. This draft proposes partial solutions to these two problems by using coarser grained identity to permit some authentication and confidentiality without user agent change, and secure DNS for key distribution. These changes also support limited host and domain level mail security policies.</t>
