    <abstract>
      <t>It is desirable that most of IPv6 deployment is based on Dual Stack IPv4 and IPv6 nodes so that interoperability with the current IPv4 based Internet be seamless. The 6to4 transition mechanism offers a automated mechanisms for addressing an IPv6 site as well as interconnectivity with other IPv6 sites when no native IPv6 connectivity is available. DSTM provides a mechanism for dynamic IPv4 address allocation to Dual Stack nodes and a mechanism to send packets over a network that only supports IPv6 routing. By combining the two mechanisms we show how Dual Stack Intranets may be deployed with minimum need for IPv4 address space and no native IPv6 connectivity.</t>
