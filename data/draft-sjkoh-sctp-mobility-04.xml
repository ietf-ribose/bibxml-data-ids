      <t>This document discusses the architecture of mobile SCTP (mSCTP) for IP mobility support. The SCTP is the third transport layer protocol next to TCP/UDP. It can also be used for IP mobility from the multi- homing features. The SCTP with the ADDIP extension (or mSCTP) would provide seamless or soft handover for the mobile host without support of routers or agents in the networks. For location management, the mSCTP could be used along with Mobile IP, Session Initiation Protocol or Reliable Server Pooling.</t>
