      <t>This memo describes a standards based approach to enable web based interactive multimedia communications. The objective is giving web developers the software tools to add communication widgets to web pages. The proposed SIP API does not necessarily require SIP protocol expertise by web developers for basic multimedia communications though it can be extended to port complex VoIP services to the web. The SIP API can also support the transition from network infrastructure based VoIP to rich web based communications. The benefits of the formal REST architecture of the web are extended to real time communications. Only two standard application layer protocols are required: HTTP for signaling data communications such as in SIP and/or XMPP and UDP for real time media transport. We consider replacing SDP with metadata about media, displays and user controls. RTP data functionality can also be moved to the application itself. NAT traversal and other functions are delegated to HIP.</t>
