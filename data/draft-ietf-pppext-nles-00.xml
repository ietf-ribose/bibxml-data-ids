    <abstract>
      <t>With the introduction of xDSL services into public telecommunications networks, direct access (in contrast to dial-up access) will start to be used as an access method for data as well as other services. PPP has been very successful in providing connections for IP as well as other protocols in the dial-up access network. With the advent of direct access, changes will be need to be made for identifying the target hosts, as it will no longer be possible to rely on the telephone number that is dialed prior to initiating the PPP session. This proposal indicates one method for adapting PPP to the new requirements.</t>
