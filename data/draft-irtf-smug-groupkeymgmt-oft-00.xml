      <t>We present and implement a scalable method for establishinggroup session keys for secure large, dynamic groups such asmulticast sessions. Our method is based on a novel applicationof One-Way Function Trees (OFTs). The number of keys stored bygroup members, the number of keys broadcast to the group whennew members are added or evicted, and the computational effortsof group members, are logarithmic in the number of group members.The method provides perfect forward and backward security:evicted members cannot read future messages, even with collusionby arbitrarily many evicted members, and newly admitted groupmembers cannot read previous messages. In comparison with theLogical Key Hierarchy (LKH) of Wallner et al., our algorithmroughly halves the number of bits that need to be broadcast tomembers in order to re-key after a member is added or evicted.In addition, and unlike LKH, our algorithm has the option of beingmember contributory in that members can be allowed to contributeentropy to the group key. Running on a Pentium with 64 MB of RAM,our prototype has handled groups with up to 100,000 members.</t>
