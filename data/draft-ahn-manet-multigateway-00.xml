      <t>In MANET, nodes wishing to communicate with nodes in the wired Internet, the global Internet connectivity is required and this functionality can be achieved with the help of the Internet gateway (IGW). For the support of reliability and flexibility, multiple IGWs can be provisioned for a MANET. In this case, load-balancing becomes one of the important issues since the network performance such as the network throughput can be improved if the load of the IGW is well-balanced. In this draft, we categorize the load-balancing mechanisms for the IPv6-based MANET with multiple IGWs and define a new load-balancing metric computed from the hop distance and the number of routing table entries.</t>
