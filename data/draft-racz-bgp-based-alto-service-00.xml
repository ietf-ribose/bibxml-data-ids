      <t>Overlay applications, like Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file-sharing and videostreaming, attract a lot of users and generate a huge amount of data.Most overlay applications do not take into account the underlyingnetwork topology in their routing decisions and connectionestablishment in general. Due to this fact and the large amount ofP2P traffic, overlay applications waste network resources, causeproblems in network management, and result in high costs for ISPs,especially because of the expensive interconnection links betweenISPs. Therefore, the objective of the ALTO Working Group Charter[ALTO-charter] is to design and specify an Application-Layer TrafficOptimization (ALTO) service that will assist P2P applications intheir peer selection process in order to achieve a more efficientusage of network resources, to reduce operational costs of ISPs, andto increase the overlay application performance at the same time.This draft proposes a possible ALTO service that uses BGP routinginformation in order to calculate a rating value for peers providinga certain resource (resource providers). The service is operated bythe ISP. Since BGP routing information is available in any ISPnetwork and the service accesses the routing information from thelocal ISP network, the deployment of the service does not requirechanges in the network and the ALTO server can retrieve routinginformation automatically.</t>
