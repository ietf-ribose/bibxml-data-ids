    <abstract>
      <t>RFC7432 defines the Designated Forwarder (DF) in (PBB-)EVPN networks as the PE responsible for sending broadcast, multicast and unknown unicast traffic (BUM) to a multi-homed device/network in the case of an all-active multi-homing ES, or BUM and unicast in the case of single-active multi-homing. The DF is selected out of a candidate list of PEs that advertise the Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) to the EVPN network, according to the 'service-carving' algorithm. While 'service-carving' provides an efficient and automated way of selecting the DF across different EVIs or ISIDs in the ES, there are some use-cases where a more 'deterministic' and user-controlled method is required. At the same time, Service Providers require an easy way to force an on-demand DF switchover in order to carry out some maintenance tasks on the existing DF or control whether a new active PE can preempt the existing DF PE. This document proposes an extension to the current RFC7432 DF election procedures so that the above requirements can be met.</t>
