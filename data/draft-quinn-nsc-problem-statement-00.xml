      <t>This document provides an overview of the issues associated with the deployment of network services (such as firewalls, load balancers) in large-scale environments. The term service chaining is used to describe the deployment of such services, and the ability of a network operator to specify an ordered list of services that should be applied to a deterministic set of traffic flows. Such service chains require integration of service policy alongside the deployment of applications, while maintaining optimal use of available network capacity and resources.</t>
