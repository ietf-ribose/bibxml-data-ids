    <abstract>
      <t>[Editor's note - there was a comment that synonymous was not the right term because synonymous implied a greater degree of interchangeability than is actually the case (there is only one way interchangeability). I have looked for other terms, and so far I have only come up with enhanced and multi-purpose, but they are not quite right either. I plan to continue with the term unless anyone has a better idea.] This document describes a method of providing flow identification information when making RFC6374 performance measurements. This allows RFC6374 measurements to be made on multi-point to point LSPs and allows the measurement of flows within an MPLS construct using RFC6374.</t>
