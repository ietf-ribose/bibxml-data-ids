      <t>This document defines the Dynamic No-Entry Zone (DNEZ) information element and its dissemination mechanism using IPv6-based vehicular networks. A DNEZ is a temporary lane-level polygonal area generated by a stopped or faulty vehicle to indicate a region that surrounding vehicles may need to avoid. The primary use case is to provide redundancy when roadside perception systems fail due to occlusion, weather, or infrastructure limitations. The DNEZ is disseminated using geographically-scoped IPv6 multicast (GeoBroadcast) as defined in RFC 9366. Receiving vehicles or Road Side Units (RSUs) may rebroadcast the message to extend coverage. Local interpretation and usage of the DNEZ is implementation-specific and outside the scope of this document.</t>
