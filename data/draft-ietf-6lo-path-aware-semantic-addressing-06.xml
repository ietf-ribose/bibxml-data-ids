    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a topological addressing scheme, Path-Aware Semantic Addressing (PASA), that enables IP packet stateless forwarding. The forwarding decision is based solely on the destination address structure. This document focuses on carrying IP packets across an LLN (Low power and Lossy Network), in which the topology is static, the location of the nodes is fixed, and the connection between the nodes is also rather stable. This specifications describes the PASA architecture, along with PASA address allocation, forwarding mechanism, header format design, and IPv6 interconnection support.</t>
