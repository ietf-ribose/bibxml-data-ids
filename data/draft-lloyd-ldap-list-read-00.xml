      <t>LDAP was originally developed as a lightweight protocol but through itsdevelopment it has added many features to a point where there is verylittle difference in terms of simplicity or code size to that of DAP.However, DAP included features which provided efficient navigationthrough a multi server distributed directory systems (List), efficientretreival (Read)and the ability to provide service controls to selectoperation requestpriority, permit/deny chained operations and theability to select master/replica data in the operation response. LDAP is now widely used as the access for X.500 distributed directorysystems, however LDAP in its original form omitted the items (List, Readand Service Controls) as defined above.The List/Read requirements were serviced by LDAP through the use of'pre-selected' Search operations. The Service Controls as per X.511for distributed operation control have in most part been omitted fromLDAP. (These are the subject of another proposal.) Experience in the field is showing that not having a List (and to alesser degree, Read) operations in LDAP accessing to distributeddirectory system causes very inefficient multi servernavigation compared to that of an LDAP Search being used. A Searchoperation is the most complicated of directory services, yet in the LDAPcase it is being used for lesser and more efficient functions.For instance, in the LDAP only multi - server environments, not havinga List operation causes considerable client re processing and protocolexchanges due to dealing with system referrals. This leads to extendeduser/client response times. For those who have already implemented aLDAP Search operation a Read and List should be of little consequence. This document defines two additional operations for LDAP namely Listand Read that extend the LDAPv3 [LDAP] operations to provide a simplenavigation/browsing and information retrieval mechanism by which aLDAP client can be</t>
