      <t>The Media Gateway Control Protocol (megaco) can be used to carry T1 Robbed Bit Signaling (RBS) between the Media Gateway (MG) and the Media Gateway Controller (MGC). This document describes the applicability of megaco to carrying T1 Robbed Bit Signaling. T1 Robbed Bit Signaling is a type of Channel Associated Signaling used mainly in the United States of America (USA) and Canada. A description and specification for T1 RBS can be found in EIA/TIA- 464-B. This draft does not define any new packages, but identifies the need for new packages to support Robbed Bit Signaling. It is anticipated that packages for FX service will be very similar to packages defined for analog lines.</t>
