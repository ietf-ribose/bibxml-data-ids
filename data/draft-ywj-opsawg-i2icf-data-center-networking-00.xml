    <abstract>
      <t>In-network computing has gained a lot of attention and been widely investigated as a research area in the past few years, due to the exposure of data plane programmability to application developers and network operators. After several years of trials and research, some of in-network computing capabilities, or to say In-Network Computing Functions (ICF) have been proved to be effective and very beneficial for networked systems and applications, like machine learning and data analysis, and these capabilities have been gradually commercialized. However, there still lacks a general framework and standardized interfaces to register, configure, manage and monitor these ICFs. This document focuses on the applicability of ICFs in a limited domain in [RFC8799], e.g., data center networks, and describes a framework for orchastrating, managing, and monitoring these ICFs.</t>
