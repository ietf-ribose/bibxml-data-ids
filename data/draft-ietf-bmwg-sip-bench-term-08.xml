    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides a terminology for benchmarking the SIP performance of networking devices. The term performance in this context means the capacity of the device- or system-under-test to process SIP messages. Terms are included for test components, test setup parameters, and performance benchmark metrics for black-box benchmarking of SIP networking devices. The performance benchmark metrics are obtained for the SIP signaling plane only. The terms are intended for use in a companion methodology document for characterizing the performance of a SIP networking device under a variety of conditions. The intent of the two documents is to enable a comparison of the capacity of SIP networking devices. Test setup parameters and a methodology document are necessary because SIP allows a wide range of configuration and operational conditions that can influence performance benchmark measurements. A standard terminology and methodology will ensure that benchmarks have consistent definition and were obtained following the same procedures.</t>
