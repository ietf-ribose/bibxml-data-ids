    <abstract>
      <t>The terms on-path attacker and MITM Attack have been used in a variety of ways, sometimes interchangeably, and sometimes meaning different things. Increasingly people have become uncomfortable with the gendered term "Man" in the middle and have sought alternatives. This document offers an update on terminology for network attacks, retaining some acronyms terms while redefining the expansion, and clarifying the different kinds of attacks. Consistent terminology is important in describing what kinds of attacks a particular protocol defends against, and which kinds the protocol does not.</t>
