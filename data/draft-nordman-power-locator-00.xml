      <t>This specification addresses how to request that a device should enter a "power locator" mode for a limited period of time. The mode involves a device cycling between a low and high power level in a predictable manner so that a power metering device upstream in the power distribution system can sense the signal and so determine where the device draws its power from. This will be useful in many types of buildings, particularly data centers and large commercial buildings. This draft addresses operation of the device carrying out the request, but not detailed operation of the device that makes the request and interprets the results. This draft is an initial discussion document to generate feedback and improvement.</t>
