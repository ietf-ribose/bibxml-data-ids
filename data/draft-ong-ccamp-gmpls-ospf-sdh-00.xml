      <t>This draft defines an optimization for bandwidth advertisement for SONET/SDH that removes the need to carry multiple copies of the ISCD sub-TLV and has been designed to be consistent with the work on Technology Agnostic OSPF Traffic Engineering Extensions for Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) [BA-TLV]. These formats are based on previous experience prototyping and testing control plane for ASON networks and are proposed for adoption as a Standards Track RFC for support of ASON routing.</t>
