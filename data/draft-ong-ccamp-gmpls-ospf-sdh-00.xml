      <t>This draft defines an optimization for bandwidth advertisement forSONET/SDH that removes the need to carry multiple copies of the ISCDsub-TLV and has been designed to be consistent with the work onTechnology Agnostic OSPF Traffic Engineering Extensions for Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) [BA-TLV].These formats are based on previous experience prototyping andtesting control plane for ASON networks and are proposed foradoption as a Standards Track RFC for support of ASON routing.</t>
