    <abstract>
      <t>Neighbor Discovery (ND) is a key protocol of IPv6 first-hop. ND uses multicast extensively and trusts all hosts. In some scenarios like wireless networks, multicast can be inefficient. In other scenarios like public access networks, hosts may not be trustable. Consequently, ND has potential issues in various scenarios. The issues and the solutions for them are documented in more than 30 RFCs. It is difficult to keep track of all these issues and solutions. Therefore, an overview and some guidelines are useful. This document firstly summarizes the known ND issues and optimization solutions into a one-stop reference. Analyzing these solutions reveals an insight: isolating hosts is effective in preventing ND issues. Five isolation methods are proposed and their applicability is discussed. Guidelines are then described for selecting a suitable isolation method based on the deployment scenario.</t>
