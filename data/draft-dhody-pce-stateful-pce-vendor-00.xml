      <t>A Stateful Path Computation Element (PCE) maintains information on the current network state, including: computed Label Switched Path (LSPs), reserved resources within the network, and pending path computation requests. This information may then be considered when computing new traffic engineered LSPs, and for associated and dependent LSPs, received from Path Computation Clients (PCCs). RFC 7470 defines a facility to carry vendor-specific information in PCEP. This document extends this capability for stateful PCE.</t>
