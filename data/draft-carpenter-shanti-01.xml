      <t>There is a pragmatic need for a packet-level translation mechanismbetween IPv4 and IPv6, for scenarios where no other mode of IPv4 toIPv6 interworking is possible. The mechanism defined here uses ashim in both the translator and the IPv6 host to mitigate theproblems introduced by stateless translation.</t>
