    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a new pre-authentication mechanism for the Kerberos protocol that uses a password authenticated key exchange. This document has three goals. First, increase the security of Kerberos pre-authentication exchanges by making offline brute-force attacks infeasible. Second, enable the use of second factor authentication without the need for a separately-established secure channel. This is achieved using the existing trust relationship established by the shared first factor. Third, make Kerberos pre- authentication more resilient against time synchronization errors by removing the need to transfer an encrypted timestamp from the client.</t>
