      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a mechanism thatallows a client to request that a particular protocol extension beused to process the request. The server declines the request if itdoes not support the extension. However, there is currently no wayfor a server to determine which extensions are supported by theclient. Knowing about client-supported extensions allows the serverto tailor its response accordingly. Furthermore, SIP does not definea way for a client to query a server about the extensions itsupports. This document defines a SIP extension that allows clientsto indicate, in a request, the set of extensions supported. We alsodefine a mechanism that allows clients, through an OPTIONS request,to determine the extensions supported by a server.</t>
