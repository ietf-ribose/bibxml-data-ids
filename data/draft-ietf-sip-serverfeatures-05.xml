      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides a mechanism that allows a client to request that a particular protocol extension be used to process the request. The server declines the request if it does not support the extension. However, there is currently no way for a server to determine which extensions are supported by the client. Knowing about client-supported extensions allows the server to tailor its response accordingly. Furthermore, SIP does not define a way for a client to query a server about the extensions it supports. This document defines a SIP extension that allows clients to indicate, in a request, the set of extensions supported. We also define a mechanism that allows clients, through an OPTIONS request, to determine the extensions supported by a server.</t>
