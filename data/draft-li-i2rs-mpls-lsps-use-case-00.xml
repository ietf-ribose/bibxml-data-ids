      <t>The Label-switched paths (LSPs) play fundument role in MPLS domain. Traditionally Label-switched paths (LSPs) are established by the network operator via CLI, SNMP or NETCONF for a variety of purposes, such as to create network-based IP virtual private networks or to route traffic along specified paths through the network. Interface to the Routing System's (I2RS) Programmatic interfaces provides an alternate way to create and maintain the LSPs.This document describes requirement and use case for which I2RS can be used for LSPs management.</t>
