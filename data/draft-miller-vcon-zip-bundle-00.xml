      <t>This document defines the vCon Zip Bundle (.vconz) file format for packaging one or more vCon conversation data containers with their associated media files into a single, self-contained ZIP archive. While vCons support external file references via HTTPS URLs with content hashes, these dependencies create availability and portability challenges. The vCon Zip Bundle addresses this through a standardized archive format that includes all referenced files, supports multiple vCons with automatic deduplication based on content hashes, preserves data integrity through hash verification, and enables offline processing. This specification maintains full compatibility with all vCon security forms (unsigned, signed, encrypted) as defined in the vCon core specification.</t>
