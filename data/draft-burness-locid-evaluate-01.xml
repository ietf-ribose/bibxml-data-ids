      <t>There are many proposals for improving the Inter-domain routing system, most of which involve a form of locater-identity split. There needs to be a means to reason about the strengths of the different proposals against the design criteria, and without requiring large scale implementations. This document aims to start this process by drawing parallels with existing systems. It identifies a number of questions that need to be more fully thought about whilst we press ahead with system development.</t>
