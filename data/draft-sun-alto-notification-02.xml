      <t>The cooperation between Internet application and network enhances not only the efficiency of network transportation but also the experiences of end users. To design the information exchanging protocol and architecture that facilitate such cooperation is the objective of Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) working group. Currently, ALTO protocol adopts an efficient query/response message based on the prevalent http protocol. However, such protocol cannot support rapid dispatch of ALTO information. Noted that many scenarios require the updated network information to be dispatched to clients as soon as possible, such as when part of the network is congested, when a new policy is to be deployed urgently, or when unexpected network maintenance is required. To tackle such problem, this draft proposed a server notification extension to the original query/response mechanism.</t>
