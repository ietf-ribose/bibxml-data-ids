      <t>The cooperation between Internet application and network enhances notonly the efficiency of network transportation but also the experiencesof end users. To design the information exchanging protocol andarchitecture that facilitate such cooperation is the objective ofApplication-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) working group.Currently, ALTO protocol adopts an efficient query/response messagebased on the prevalent http protocol. However, such protocol cannotsupport rapid dispatch of ALTO information. Noted that many scenariosrequire the updated network information to be dispatched to clients assoon as possible, such as when part of the network is congested, when anew policy is to be deployed urgently, or when unexpected networkmaintenance is required. To tackle such problem, this draft proposed aserver notification extension to the original query/response mechanism.</t>
