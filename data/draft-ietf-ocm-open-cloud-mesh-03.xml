    <abstract>
      <t>Open Cloud Mesh (OCM) is a server federation protocol that is used to notify a Receiving Party that they have been granted access to some Resource. It has similarities with authorization flows such as OAuth, as well as with social internet protocols such as ActivityPub and email. A core use case of OCM is when a user (e.g., Alice on System A) wishes to share a resource (e.g., a file) with another user (e.g., Bob on System B) without transferring the resource itself or requiring Bob to log in to System A. While this scenario is illustrative, OCM is designed to support a broader range of interactions, including but not limited to file transfers. Open Cloud Mesh handles interactions only up to the point where the Receiving Party is informed of their access to the Resource. Actual Resource access is subsequently managed by other protocols, such as WebDAV.</t>
