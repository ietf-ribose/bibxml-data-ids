      <t>TLS as been designed to setup and authenticate transport layer between endpoints. A lot of applications are using TLS in order to set communications between the applications end points. As long as applications end points and transport end points were combined into the same host, application authentication could be combined with the transport authentication. As the current internet is decoupling the transport and application layers, such model may not be applicable anymore. In other words, TLS authentication cannot be handled on behalf of the application authentication. This document describes use cases where the authentication of the transport layer differs from the authentication performed at the application layer.</t>
