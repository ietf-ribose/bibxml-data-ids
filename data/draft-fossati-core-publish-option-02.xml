      <t>This memo defines the Publish Option for the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). This Option is used by a CoAP Endpoint to control the authority delegation of one of its resources to another Endpoint. All the phases of the authority delegation process (setup, renewal, cancellation) are controlled by a simple RESTful protocol. This memo also introduces the 'proxies' Web Linking relation type, to be used by a CoAP Proxy to explicitly advertise the resources that it can serve from its cache, or by forwarding the Client request upstream (either to the origin, or to another Proxy).</t>
