    <abstract>
      <t>Several industry fora have joined forces and are developing an information base from which APIs can be developed. These APIs, exposed to the world in Java or OMG IDL, provide access to capabilities of the converged (i.e., packet/circuit, wired/wireless) Next Generation Network (NGN) in a network technology independent fashion. Additionally, the SPIRITS protocol provides access to these capabilities.</t>
