    <abstract>
      <t>The rapid increase in enterprise and service provider network architecture complexity makes operating and managing services much more difficult. Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) defines a generic policy information model, and associated generic YANG data models, for different types of policy rules that control managed entities throughout the service development and deployment lifecycle. It also defines a mapping by which the management and monitoring of network services can be done using standardized policy rules.</t>
