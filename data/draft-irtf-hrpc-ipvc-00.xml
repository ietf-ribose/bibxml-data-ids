      <t>This document aims to inform how Internet protocols and their implementations might better mitigate technical attacks at the user endpoint by describing technology-based practices to perpetrate intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV is a pervasive reality that is not limited to, but can be exacerbated with, the usage of technology. The IPV context enables the attacker to access one, some or all of: devices, local networks, authentication mechanisms, identity information, and accounts. These kinds of technical compromise exist in addition to on-path attacks, both active and passive [RFC7624]. In this document we describe the tactics the IPV attacker uses and what kind of counter-measures can be designed in IETF protocols.</t>
