      <t>This document describes a proposal for the SPEECHSC protocol and aims to meet the requirements specified in the SPEECHSC working group requirements document. It is based on the Media Resource Control Protocol (MRCP) developed jointly by Cisco Systems, Inc., Nuance Communications, and Speechworks Inc. The SPEECHSC protocol will control media service resources like speech synthesizers, recognizers, signal generators, signal detectors, fax servers etc. over a network. This protocol depends on a session management protocol such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to establish a separate SPEECHSC control session between the client and the media server. It also depends on SIP to establish the media pipe and associated parameters between the media source or sink and the media server. Once this is done, the SPEECHSC protocol exchange can happen over the control session established above allowing the client to command and control the media processing resources that may exist on the media server.</t>
