      <t>The memo [9], which has been approved by the IESG to be published as an Informational RFC, enumerates a number of objectives that the SMIng language is expected to fulfill. This memo describes the compliance of a proposal based on former IRTF NMRG [8] work and published in [10] and companion I-Ds for each of the strived objectives. This is done by including the whole list of objectives without any changes, but adding a compliance section for each of the objectives, so that reading is as easy as possible.</t>
