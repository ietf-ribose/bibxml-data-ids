      <t>The memo [9], which has been approved by the IESG to be published asan Informational RFC, enumerates a number of objectives that theSMIng language is expected to fulfill. This memo describes thecompliance of a proposal based on former IRTF NMRG [8] work andpublished in [10] and companion I-Ds for each of the strivedobjectives. This is done by including the whole list of objectiveswithout any changes, but adding a compliance section for each of theobjectives, so that reading is as easy as possible.</t>
