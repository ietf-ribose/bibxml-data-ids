      <t>Several multicast key management schemes such as those proposed by Wallner et al, Wong et al and Balenson et al are based on a multilevel, logical hierarchy (or tree) of key-encrypting keys. When used in conjunction with a reliable multicast infrastructure, this approach results in a highly efficient key update mechanism in which the number of multicast messages transmitted upon a membership updateis proportional to the depth of the tree, which is logarithmic in the size of the secure multicast group, provided the tree is maintained ina balanced manner. Therefore the issue of maintaining such trees in a balanced manner is quite relevant in practice. This draft which is based on the design principles followed in an implementation of secure multicast using the Wallner key-management scheme, describes efficient techniques to maintain a balanced key tree in the presenceof arbitrary group membership updates. This draft also describes other optimizations which were found to be useful in practice.</t>
