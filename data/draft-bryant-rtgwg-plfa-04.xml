      <t>Fast re-route (FRR) is a technique that allows productive forwarding to continue in a network after a failure has occurred, but before the network has has time to re-converge. This is achieved by forwarding a packet on an alternate path that will not result in the packet looping. Preferred Path Routing (PPR) provides a method of injecting explicit paths into the routing protocol. The use of PPR to support FRR has a number of advantages. This document describes the advantages of using PPR to provide a loop-free alternate FRR path, and provides a framework for its use in this application.</t>
