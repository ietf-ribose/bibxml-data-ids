      <t>This memo specifies the application of Network Time Security, a mechanism for using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) to provide cryptographic security for the unicast mode of the Precision Time Protocol. It is based on the 'Network Time Security for the Network Time Protocol' document RFC8915 and re-uses most of its mechanisms for providing a secure and robust key exchange solution for unicast PTP. Due to the different modes of operation, additional steps are required to secure unicast PTP communication between the PTP clients and unicast PTP servers. In addition to defining the new record types and other required values to allow the utilization of the NTS key exchange sub protocol, there are a number of additional protocol enhancements and server-side requirements which are defined in this memo.</t>
