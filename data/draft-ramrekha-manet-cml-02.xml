      <t>This document describes the ChaMeLeon (CML) routing protocoldesigned for Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) supporting emergencycommunications. CML is a hybrid and adaptive routing protocoloperating within a defined disaster area denoted as the CriticalArea (CA). The main concept behind CML is the adaptability of itsrouting mechanisms towards changes in the physical and logical stateof a MANET. For autonomous emergency communications, there is alikelihood that the network size will vary whenever more rescuersjoin or leave the network. In addition, battery exhaustion oflightweight mobile communication devices used by rescuers couldstipulate another reason for changes in the network size. Hence,this version of CML adapts its routing behavior according to changesin the network size within a pre-defined CA. For small networks, CMLroutes data proactively using the Optimized Link State Routing(OLSR) protocol whereas for larger networks it utilizes the reactiveAd hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing protocol so thatoverall routing performance is improved. These transitions occur viathe CML oscillation phase. This document focuses on the descriptionof the processes involved in the CML Cognitive and Adaptive Module(CAM), CML Oscillation phase and transition between phases.</t>
