      <t>This document specifies an algorithm for the generation of TCPInitial Sequence Numbers (ISNs), such that the chances of an off-pathattacker of guessing the sequence numbers in use by a targetconnection are reduced. This document is a revision of RFC 1948, andtakes the ISN generation algorithm originally proposed in thatdocument to Standards Track.</t>
