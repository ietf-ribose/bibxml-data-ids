      <t>This document specifies an algorithm for the generation of TCP Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs), such that the chances of an off-path attacker of guessing the sequence numbers in use by a target connection are reduced. This document is a revision of RFC 1948, and takes the ISN generation algorithm originally proposed in that document to Standards Track.</t>
