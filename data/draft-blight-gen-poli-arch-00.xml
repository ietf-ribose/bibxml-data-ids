      <t>Out goal is describe a simple policy framework (or architecture) which is both practical to implement, and easy to extend. Our framework is driven by the in- formation which needs to be exchanged, and the communication system required to implement it. We view policies as a specification for network management systems, and have constructed our framework based on that assumption. We forces us to consider a more general architecture, than one based on QoS assumptions alone.</t>
