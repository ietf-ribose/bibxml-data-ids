      <t>RFC 8938, the Deterministic Networking Data Plane Framework relies on the 6-tuple to identify an IPv6 flow. But the full DetNet operations require also the capabilities to signal meta-information such as a sequence within that flow, and to transport different types of packets along the same path with the same treatment, e.g., Operations, Administration, and Maintenance packets and/or multiple flows with fate and resource sharing. This document introduces new IPv6 Hop-by-Hop options that signal that path and redundancy information to the intermediate DetNet relays.</t>
