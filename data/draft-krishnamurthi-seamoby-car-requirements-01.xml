      <t>The pre-requisite for IP based seamless mobility protocols is theknowledge of the access router (AR) to which a mobile node can behanded over to. Further, a handoff can be optimized if the capabilitiesof the AR being considered for handoff are known. The protocol whichdiscovers ARs for potential handoff along with their capabilities iscalled the CAR discovery protocol.
