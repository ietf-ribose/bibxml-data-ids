      <t>Delivery of streaming media to a large number of clients distributedacross several geographic and network boundaries presents severalchallenges in terms of scalability and stream quality. This documentdescribes N-tier relays to address scalability and quality issues inthe delivery of stored and live content. This document addressesissues in stream synchronization, content announcement/expiry,reliability of transport, failover/recovery, administration, andsecurity issues. This document propose a set of primitives to enableimplementation of Push and Pull mechanisms for N-tier relays. We alsoprovide usage scenarios where each approach is most useful. The Pulland Push mechanisms are complementary and provide valuable buildingblocks in N-tier relays. This document introduces a few new RTSPmethods and headers.</t>
