      <t>Delivery of streaming media to a large number of clients distributed across several geographic and network boundaries presents several challenges in terms of scalability and stream quality. This document describes N-tier relays to address scalability and quality issues in the delivery of stored and live content. This document addresses issues in stream synchronization, content announcement/expiry, reliability of transport, failover/recovery, administration, and security issues. This document propose a set of primitives to enable implementation of Push and Pull mechanisms for N-tier relays. We also provide usage scenarios where each approach is most useful. The Pull and Push mechanisms are complementary and provide valuable building blocks in N-tier relays. This document introduces a few new RTSP methods and headers.</t>
