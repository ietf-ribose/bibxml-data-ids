      <t>This document supplements and revises RFC7606. According to RFC 7606, when an UPDATE packet received from a neighbor contains an attribute of incorrect format, the BGP session cannot be reset directly. Instead, the BGP session must be reset based on the specific problem. Error packets must minimize the impact on routes and do not affect the correctness of the protocol. Different error handling methods are used. The error handling methods include discarding attributes, withdrawing routes, disabling the address family, and resetting sessions. RFC 7606 specifies the error handling methods of some existing attributes and provides guidance for error handling of new attributes. This document supplements the error handling methods for common attributes that are not specified in RFC7606, and provides suggestions for revising the error handling methods for some attributes. The general principle remains unchanged: Maintain established BGP sessions and keep valid routes updated. However, discard or delete incorrect attributes or packets to minimize the impact on the current session.</t>
