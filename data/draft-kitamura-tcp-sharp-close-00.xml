      <t>This document describes an idea "Sharp Close" that eliminates or minimizes TIME-WAIT state of TCP connections. In the current TCP specification ([RFC0793]), there are some inappropriate or not up to date functions. Here we focus and discuss on TCP TIME-WAIT state function. TIME-WAIT is the last state of TCP connection of Active Close side node. After TCP connections are effectively closed, they move to TIME-WAIT state. After TIME-WAIT state is finished, resources of connections are released. This means that even if connections are effectively finished, resources of connections are NOT released. The TIME-WAIT state prevents from releasing them. From the viewpoints of current high-speed and high-multiplicity communication styles, it is thought that TIME-WAIT state is one of evil functions. In order to provide efficient communication that matches current styles, an idea "Sharp Close" that eliminates or minimizes TIME- WAIT state of TCP connections is proposed.</t>
