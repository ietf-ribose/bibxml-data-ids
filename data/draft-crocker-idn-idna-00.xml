      <t>Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) use Unicode fordomain name, rather than using a subset of ASCII. Thisincreased name space, as well the requirement tomaintain compatibility with the existing domain nameservice means that IDNs must be encoded in a form thatcan be supported without changes to any portion of theDNS that does not participate in the upgrade to IDN.This specification defines a mechanism called IDNA forhandling them in a standard fashion and specifies anIDNA profile for domain names used as host references.IDNA allows non-ASCII characters to be represented usingthe same octets used in so-called host names today. Thisrepresentation allows IDNs to be introduced with minimalchanges to the existing DNS infrastructure. IDNA is onlymeant for processing domain names, not free text.</t>
