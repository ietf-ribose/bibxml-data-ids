      <t>This Internet Draft discusses three possible forms of interactionamong IPsec Policies referred to as Policy Resolution, PolicyCorrelation and Policy Reconciliation. It also proposes twooperators, Policy Composition (*) and Policy Difference (-), todeduce the results of policy interactions. The definitions of theseoperators establish an algebraic semantics of IPsec Policies basedon partially ordered set theory. This formal semantics can be usedto ensure consistency of IPsec Policy processing.</t>
