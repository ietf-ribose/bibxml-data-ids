      <t>This Internet Draft discusses three possible forms of interaction among IPsec Policies referred to as Policy Resolution, Policy Correlation and Policy Reconciliation. It also proposes two operators, Policy Composition (*) and Policy Difference (-), to deduce the results of policy interactions. The definitions of these operators establish an algebraic semantics of IPsec Policies based on partially ordered set theory. This formal semantics can be used to ensure consistency of IPsec Policy processing.</t>
