      <t>ISAKMP and PKIX both provide frameworks that must be profiled for use in a given application. This document provides a profile of ISAKMP and PKIX that defines the requirements for using PKI technology in the context of IPsec. The document compliments protocol specifications such as IKE, which assume the existence of public key certificates and related keying materials, but which do not address PKI issues explicitly. This document addresses those issues.</t>
