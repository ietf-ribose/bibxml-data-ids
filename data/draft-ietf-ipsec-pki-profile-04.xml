      <t>ISAKMP and PKIX both provide frameworks that must be profiled for usein a given application. This document provides a profile of ISAKMPand PKIX that defines the requirements for using PKI technology inthe context of IPsec. The document compliments protocolspecifications such as IKE, which assume the existence of public keycertificates and related keying materials, but which do not addressPKI issues explicitly. This document addresses those issues.</t>
