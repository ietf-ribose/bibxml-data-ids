    <abstract>
      <t>TRILL active-active service is to provide end stations with flow level load balance and resilience against link failures at the edge of TRILL campuses. This draft proposes that member RBridges in an active-active edge RBridge group use their own nicknames as ingress RBridge nicknames to encapsulate frames from attached end systems. Thus, remote edge RBridges are required to learn multiple locations of one MAC address in one Data Label. Design goals of this proposal are discussed in the document.</t>
