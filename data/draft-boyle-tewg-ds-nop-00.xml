      <t>The emerging requirements for differentiated service control in MPLS based traffic engineered networks [DSTE-REQ] can be met by existing specifications. Current implementations could be adapted with a relaxed perception of semantics on the syntax outlined in current specifications [OSPF-TE][ISIS-TE][RSVP-TE]. This would provide for a solution that fulfills the scenarios and functionality requirements called for in DSTE-REQ.</t>
