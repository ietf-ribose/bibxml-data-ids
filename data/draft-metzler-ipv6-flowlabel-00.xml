      <t>IP version 6 is specified in [1], but it specifies not completely the usage of the flow label field that is contained in the IPv6 Header. This document specifies a potential use of the IPv6 flow label that provide to applications access to the flow label so as to distinguish between several flows within the application. This results in basic requirements on the handling of the flow label within the network.</t>
