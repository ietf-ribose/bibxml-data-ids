      <t>This document describes an extension to the IKEv2 protocol thatallows for faster detection of SA desynchronization using a savedtoken.When an IPsec tunnel between two IKEv2 peers is disconnected due to arestart of one peer, it can take as much as several minutes for theother peer to discover that the reboot has occurred, thus delayingrecovery. In this text we propose an extension to the protocol, thatallows for recovery immediately following the restart.</t>
