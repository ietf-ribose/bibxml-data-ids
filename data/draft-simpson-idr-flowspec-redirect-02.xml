      <t>Flow-spec is an extension to BGP that allows for the dissemination of traffic flow specification rules. This has many possible applications but the primary one for many network operators is the distribution of traffic filtering actions for DDoS mitigation. The flow-spec standard [RFC 5575] defines a redirect-to-VRF action for policy-based forwarding but this mechanism can be difficult to use, particularly in networks without L3 VPNs. This draft proposes a new redirect-to-IP flow-spec action that provides a simpler method of policy-based forwarding. This action is indicated by the presence of a new BGP extended community in the flow-spec route. Many routers already support a redirect-to-IP filter action and, in this case, the only new functionality implied by this draft is the ability to signal the action using flow-spec.</t>
