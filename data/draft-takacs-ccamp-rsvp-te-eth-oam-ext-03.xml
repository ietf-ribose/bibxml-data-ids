      <t>The GMPLS controlled Ethernet Label Switching (GELS) work isextending GMPLS RSVP-TE to support the establishment of EthernetLSPs. IEEE Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) specifies anadjunct OAM flow to check connectivity in Ethernet networks. CFM canbe also used with Ethernet LSPs for fault detection and triggeringrecovery mechanisms. The ITU-T Y.1731 specification builds on CFMand specifies additional OAM mechanisms, including PerformanceMonitoring, for Ethernet networks. This document specifiesextensions of GMPLS RSVP-TE to support the setup of the associatedEthernet OAM (CFM and Y.1731) entities adding a technology specificTLV to [OAM-CONF-FWK].Changes from previous versionTechnology independent extensions were moved to a separate frameworkdocument leaving only the Ethernet specific extensions in thisdocument.Requirements LanguageThe key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in</t>
