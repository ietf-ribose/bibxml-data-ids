      <t>The current proposal for multicast in BGP/MPLS includes multiplealternative mechanisms for some of the required building blocks ofthe solution. The aim of this document is to leverage previouslydocumented requirements to identify the key elements and help moveforward solution design, toward the definition of a standard having awell defined set of mandatory procedures. The different proposedalternative mechanisms are examined in the light of requirementsidentified for multicast in L3VPNs, and suggestions are made aboutwhich of these mechanisms standardization should favor. Issuesrelated to existing deployments of early implementations are alsoaddressed.</t>
