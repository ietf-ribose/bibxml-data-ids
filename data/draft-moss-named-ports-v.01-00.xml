      <t>This likely involves a new TCP/IP standard. I'm not so technical to know if it's feasible or informed to know if it exists (perhaps in IPv6), or is proposed. But simply put, in addition to the numbered range of ports used now for IP services like ssh, http, etc., in the interest of security, arbitrary named ports could be used e.g. http://foo.bar.net:mooky, or telnet 0 thisone, further these named ports could be encrypted strings.</t>
