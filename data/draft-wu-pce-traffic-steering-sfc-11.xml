      <t>This document provides an overview of the usage of Path Computation Element (PCE) to dynamically structure service function chains. Service Function Chaining (SFC) is a technique that is meant to facilitate the dynamic enforcement of differentiated traffic forwarding policies within a domain. Service function chains are composed of an ordered set of elementary Service Functions (such as firewalls, load balancers) that need to be invoked according to the design of a given service. Corresponding traffic is thus forwarded along a Service Function Path (SFP) that can be computed by means of PCE. This document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to compute and instantiate Service Function Paths.</t>
