      <t>There are several motivations for using compound authentication methodsusing tunnels, but man-in-the-middle attacks have been found in theseprotocols under certain circumstances. They occur when the inner methods used inside a tunnel method are also used outside it, withoutcryptographically binding the methods together. At the time of writing this document, several protocols being proposed within the IETF were vulnerable to these attacks, including IKE with XAUTH, PIC, PANA over TLS, EAP TTLS and PEAP. This document studies the problems and suggests potential solutions to mitigate them. We also provide a reference solution for an EAP tunneling protocol like PEAP.</t>
