      <t>This memo describes a method of representing the registration policy that a zone administrator uses for registering Internationalised Domain Names using Extensible Markup Language (XML). These registry policies, commonly known as "IDN tables", are used to enforce and share policy on which specific code-points are permitted for registrations, and which alternative code-points are considered variants.</t>
