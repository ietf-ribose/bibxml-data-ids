      <t>Fast Payload Replication (FPR) is a technique for fanning out thepayloads of individual packets to large numbers of recipients. Itwas developed as the central part of Ivip's real-time mappingdistribution system. However, as of late February 2010, Ivip has anew mapping system: Distributed Real Time Mapping (DRTM) whichoperates on different principles. Therefore, the material in this IDis no longer an essential part of Ivip. Some of it may be useful forother purposes and for two potential purposes in Ivip, both of whichare entirely optional.</t>
