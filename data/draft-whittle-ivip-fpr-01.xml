      <t>Fast Payload Replication (FPR) is a technique for fanning out the payloads of individual packets to large numbers of recipients. It was developed as the central part of Ivip's real-time mapping distribution system. However, as of late February 2010, Ivip has a new mapping system: Distributed Real Time Mapping (DRTM) which operates on different principles. Therefore, the material in this ID is no longer an essential part of Ivip. Some of it may be useful for other purposes and for two potential purposes in Ivip, both of which are entirely optional.</t>
