      <t>In some M2M scenarios, it is convenient to offer non-centralized alternatives for discovery and rendezvous. This document defines a Distributed Resource Directory (DRD) for Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). Distribution is achieved by means of a structured Peer-to-Peer (P2P) overlay. The DHT-based P2P overlay provides discovery, rendezvous and caching services for CoAP End-points as well as HTTP proxy service for Web clients.</t>
