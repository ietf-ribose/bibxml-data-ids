      <t>This document describes the identity trust system, which is an open identity authentication system that does not require federation of authentication domains. It is based on a symmetric authentication protocol and a specific infrastructure to ensure trust in the identity providers (IdPs). Regarding the main components: 1. Symmetric authentication protocol - Both entities MUST recognize each other and are authenticated by their identity provider according to a symmetric scheme. This protocol builds on and extends the OAuth Authorization Framework RFC6749. 2. Trustees' network - A special network, dedicated to creating a protected environment for exchanging authentication messages between IdPs, constitutes the infrastructure to avoid domain federation. 3. Custodian concept - IdPs are divided into two typologies to better protect personal data. A generic IdP (called trustee) for pure digital authentication and a specific IdP (called custodian) under the control of the country's authority with legal right to the individual's real data to ensure physical identity.</t>
