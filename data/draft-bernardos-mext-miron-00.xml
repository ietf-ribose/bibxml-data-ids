      <t>The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to roamand attach to different access networks without disrupting theongoing sessions that nodes of the network may have. By extendingthe Mobile IPv6 support to Mobile Routers, nodes of the network arenot required to support any kind of mobility, since packets must gothrough the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA) bi-directional tunnel.Communications from/to a mobile network have to traverse the HomeAgent, and therefore better paths may be available. Additionally,this solution adds packet overhead, due to the encapsulation.This document describes an approach to the Route Optimisation forNEMO, called Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation for NEMO (MIRON). MIRONenables mobility-agnostic nodes within the mobile network to directlycommunicate (i.e. without traversing the MRHA bi-directional tunnel)with Correspondent Nodes. The solution is based on the Mobile Routerperforming the Mobile IPv6 Route Optimisation signalling on behalf ofthe nodes of the mobile network.This document (in an appendix) also analyses how MIRON fits each ofthe currently identified NEMO Route Optimisation requirements forOperational Use in Aeronautics and Space Exploration.</t>
