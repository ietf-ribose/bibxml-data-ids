      <t>This draft outlines how a dual stack mobile node can be reached andcommunicate by means of both IPv4 and IPv6, even in situations wherethe mobile node is in reach of only either IPv4 or IPv6 networks. ADual Stack Mobility Agent accommodates mobility and translatesbetween IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. It may operate as a mobility agent inits own right or as a module that relays traffic between existingsingle stack Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6 home agents.</t>
