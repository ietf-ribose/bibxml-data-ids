    <title>Understanding and Using SNMP Security Services</title>
    <date year="1991" month="January" day="15"/>
    <abstract>
      <t>This memo discusses SNMP security protocols insofar as it presents a threat analysis and enumeration of goals. However, its main purpose is to discuss two SNMP security algorithms. First, under the rubric ``Understanding SNMP Security,'' it describes the design of the algorithms with an emphasis on how their various mechanisms collectively realize the design goals and constraints; second, under the rubric ``Using SNMP Security,'' it also describes how SNMP security services are best exploited to realize effective, secure network management in a variety of configurations and environments.</t>
