      <t>This paper proposes a temporary solution to the QoS implementation in IPv6, the design of which uses the Hop-by-Hop Extension header and not the 20-bit flow label field in the IPv6 main header. This paper deals extensively with Integrated Services type of QoS model (like the one supported by RSVP) and gives the definition of the important TLV options that will be needed to specify the Type of QoS and the corresponding resource requirements in the Hop-by-Hop Extension Header.</t>
