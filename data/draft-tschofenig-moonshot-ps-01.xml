      <t>It is quite common that application developers and system architectsare in need for authentication and authorization support in adistributed environment. At least three parties need to cooperate,namely the end host, the identity provider, and the relying party.At the end of the exchange the identity provider asserts identityinformation or certain attributes to the relying party withoutexposing the user's long-term secret to the relying party.Although the problem sounds challenging and interesting, it is notnew. In fact, various IETF groups have produced specifications tosolve this problem, such as Kerberos, RADIUS, and Diameter. Outsidethe IETF various Single-Sign-On solution for HTTP-based applicationshave been developed as well.The reader might therefore wonder about the need for new work giventhe existence of readily available solutions. This document tries toanswer this question in a compact fashion. Note that the descriptionin this document focuses on the scope of the new work as part of the"Federated Authentication Beyond The Web" BOF being proposed ratherthan what could be theoretically done.</t>
