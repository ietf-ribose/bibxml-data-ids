      <t>This document describes an approach to support multicast listenersand senders located within a moving IPv6 network (NEMO). A NEMOis built up by at least one Mobile Router (MR) and a set of MobileNetwork Nodes (MNNs). The MR handles all routing related tasks to provide connectivity between the MNNs and an access networkincluding mobility management. Correspondingly the MR alsosubscribes to multicast groups and forwards emerging multicasttraffic on behalf of a MNN.For optimised routing of multicast data a hierarchical multicastagent is introduced as a logical entity providing an anchor to themulticast tree. In the MR a corresponding functionality is definedwhich decides on the location of the specific agent to be used for adistinct multicast traffic.Conventions used in this documentThe key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].</t>
