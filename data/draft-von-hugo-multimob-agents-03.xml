      <t>This document describes an approach to support multicast listeners and senders located within a moving IPv6 network (NEMO). A NEMO is built up by at least one Mobile Router (MR) and a set of Mobile Network Nodes (MNNs). The MR handles all routing related tasks to provide connectivity between the MNNs and an access network including mobility management. Correspondingly the MR also subscribes to multicast groups and forwards emerging multicast traffic on behalf of a MNN. For optimised routing of multicast data a hierarchical multicast agent is introduced as a logical entity providing an anchor to the multicast tree. In the MR a corresponding functionality is defined which decides on the location of the specific agent to be used for a distinct multicast traffic. Conventions used in this document The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [1].</t>
