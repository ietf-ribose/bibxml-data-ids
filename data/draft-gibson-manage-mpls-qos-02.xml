      <t>There is an increasing use of real-time applications on IP networks. As these applications require certain QoS levels to operate acceptably there is a need for IP networks to guarantee such levels. This draft introduces a set of requirements that must be fulfilled in order that an MPLS network can support QoS-dependant IP flows as set out in the VoMPLS draft [2]. A candidate architecture that conforms to these requirements is then set out. The network consists of a session control layer, an IP Layer that is constrained through the use of MPLS tunnels, and a distributed management system to control those tunnels. The draft describes each of the essential components needed to implement such a network and suggests suitable technologies for each of them.</t>
