      <t>There is an increasing use of real-time applications on IP networks.As these applications require certain QoS levels to operateacceptably there is a need for IP networks to guarantee such levels.This draft introduces a set of requirements that must be fulfilledin order that an MPLS network can support QoS-dependant IP flows asset out in the VoMPLS draft [2]. A candidate architecture thatconforms to these requirements is then set out. The network consistsof a session control layer, an IP Layer that is constrained throughthe use of MPLS tunnels, and a distributed management system tocontrol those tunnels.The draft describes each of the essential components needed toimplement such a network and suggests suitable technologies for eachof them.</t>
