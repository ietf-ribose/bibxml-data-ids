      <t>Recent advances in Internet of Things(IoT) have increased the usage ofsensing technologies. Breakthroughs is microelectronics have increased theuse of wearable devices to monitor human body functions and its surroundings.A typical wearable device has low resources in terms of power and processingcapabilities. Reducing the energy consumption is one of the key design factorsin a wearable network so that the devices may work for longer duration. Idlelistening and overhearing are major causes of energy consumption. These issuescan be resolved by maximizing the sleeping time of a device (switched off) and avoidunnecessary wakeup time (idle listening) to save energy. An external wakeupscheduling to handle the sleep/wakeup cycle of a device can be adapted.This document describes how a 2wakeup scheduling using an out-of-bound externalwake up mechanism can work to successfully increase the lifetime of a typicalbody-centric wearable network (S-BCN).</t>
