      <t>This document gives the outline of one possible way to structure the work that is presently carried out by the IESG. It is provided to the community in order to solicit commentary and inspire more ideas. The IESG has discussed this proposal, and much of the material is the result of those discussions, but the IESG has not reached consensus on this or any other proposal at the time of publication. Comments are welcome, and can be directed to the editor, the IESG, or to the solutions mailing list &lt;solutions@alvestrand.no&gt;</t>
