      <t>Cryptographically Generated Addresses as defined for IPv6 SecureNeighbor Discovery are generated locally on the host using the CGA.However, it can be desireable for other systems to be involved in thegeneration and use of CGAs in a number of ways: offloading the heavycryptography for generating or validating CGAs, proxy-generation ofCGAs for hosts that don't support the CGA-related protocolsthemselves or registration of CGA addresses for the purposes ofcentral address administration. When additional hosts are involvedin aspects of CGA, it's necessary to discover these other hostsand/or additional configuration items such as the Sec value. TheDHCPv6 is a natural choice for doing this. This document provides anoverview of the opportunities and issues in this area.</t>
