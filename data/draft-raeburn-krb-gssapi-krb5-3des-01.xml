      <t>The GSSAPI Kerberos 5 mechanism definition [GSSAPI-KRB5] specifically enumerates encryption and checksum types, independently of how such schemes may be used in Kerberos. In the long run, a new Kerberos- based mechanism, which does not require separately enumerating for the GSSAPI mechanism each of the various encryption types defined by Kerberos, is probably a better approach. Various people have expressed interest in designing one, but the work has not yet been completed.</t>
