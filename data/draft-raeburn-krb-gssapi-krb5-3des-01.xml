      <t>The GSSAPI Kerberos 5 mechanism definition [GSSAPI-KRB5] specificallyenumerates encryption and checksum types, independently of how suchschemes may be used in Kerberos. In the long run, a new Kerberos-based mechanism, which does not require separately enumerating forthe GSSAPI mechanism each of the various encryption types defined byKerberos, is probably a better approach. Various people haveexpressed interest in designing one, but the work has not yet beencompleted.</t>
