      <t>The main focus of this draft is to incorporate certain level of session control mechanism within a RTP session. One of the high demands of current IP network is to provide high performance for instant messaging, push to talk and other applications along those lines. For all of these kinds of services, it is better not to go through the out-of-band session control path and control the session within RTP session. Here the suggestion is to define an extension of RTCP.</t>
