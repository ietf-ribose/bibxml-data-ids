      <t>The main focus of this draft is to incorporate certain level of sessioncontrol mechanism within a RTP session. One of the high demands ofcurrent IP network is to provide high performance for instantmessaging, push to talk and other applications along those lines. Forall of these kinds of services, it is better not to go through theout-of-band session control path and control the session within RTPsession. Here the suggestion is to define an extension of RTCP.</t>
