      <t>STD numbers are assigned to IETF Standards Track specifications inorder to provide a stable reference even when RFCs are revised andthe underlying documents change. However, the numbers are onlyassigned when the specifications reach Full Standard maturity level,significantly reducing their utility in the contemporary world inwhich few specifications advance beyond the first standardizationmaturity level. For that reason, one recent proposal suggestedeliminating the numbers entirely. This document argues that stablereferences for Standards Track specifications are actually useful andthat the solution is not to abolish the numbers but to change thepoint at which they are assigned.</t>
