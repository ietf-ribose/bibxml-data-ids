      <t>This memo argues that the danger of segments from old TCP connections occurs for connections terminated by RST segments, as well as those terminated by exchange of FIN segments. In addition, insertion of TIME-WAIT state alone does not provide complete protection. The likelihood of data corruption is significant, exceeding the probability of corruption after FIN exchange for which TIME-WAIT state was designed.</t>
