      <t>This draft describes a new AppMetaData subTLV carried by Tunnel Encap[RFC9012] Path Attribute for egress router to advertise the running status and environment of the directly attached 5G Edge Computing servers. The AppMetaData can be used by the ingress routers in the 5G Local Data Network to make intelligent path selection for flows from UEs. The goal is to improve latency and performance for 5G Edge Computing services. The extension enables a feature, called soft anchoring, which makes one Edge Computing Server at one specific location to be more preferred than others for the same application to receive packets from a specific source (UE).</t>
