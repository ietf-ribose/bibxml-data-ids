      <t>This document specifies requirements for interconnecting, or peering, the distribution systems of Content Networks (CN). Distribution internetworking requires advertising the capabilities of a CN offering distribution services, moving content from one CN to another, and signaling requirements for consistent storage and delivery of content. This document does not address requirements for directing user agents to distributed content, nor for aggregating access information for distributed content.</t>
