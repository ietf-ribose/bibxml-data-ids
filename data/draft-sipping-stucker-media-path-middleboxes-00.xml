      <t>Middleboxes are defined as any intermediary box performing functionsapart from normal, standard functions of an IP router on the datapath between a source host and destination host. Two such functionsare network address translation and firewalling.When Application Layer Gateways, such as SIP entities, interact withNATs and firewalls, as described in the MIDCOM architecture, thenproblems may occur in the transport of media traffic when signalingprotocol interaction takes place along the media path, as it is thecase for recent key exchange proposals (such as DTLS-SRTP). Thisdocument highlights problems that may arise. Unfortunately, it isdifficult for the end points to detect or predict problematicbehavior and to determine whether the media path is reliablyavailable for packet exchange.This document aims to summarize the various sources and effects ofNAT and firewall control, the reasons that they exist, and possiblemeans of improving their behavior to allow protocols that rely uponsignaling along the media path to operate effectively.</t>
