      <t>The widespread adoption of Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) led Mailing List Managers (MLM) to rewrite the From: header field as a workaround. This document proposes three methods to get rid of munged From: lines. The methods vary requirements, complexity and success rates. Method one considers how MLMs can avoid From: munging for specific users. Methods two uses the Author: header field while method three tries to revert MLM transformations, in order to restore the original From: line after reception.</t>
