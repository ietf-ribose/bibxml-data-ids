      <t>Multi-homing of NVEs is a desirable feature to NVO3 since it provides Tenant Systems with reliable connection, load-balance, etc. The major issue of the multi-homing of NVEs is that it introduces one-to-many mapping from Tenant System (inner) addresses to NVE (outer) addresses. This document identifies the requirements for multi-homing of NVEs and specifies corresponding solutions to meet these requirements. The key is to let remote NVEs be aware of the group of NVEs that are offering multi-homing to Tenant Systems, therefore the remote NVE can cope with the one-to-many mapping correctly.</t>
