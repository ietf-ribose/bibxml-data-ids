      <t>This document proposes a new CoAP response code, 2.06 Pending. A CoAP server can use this response code to signal that it has accepted the request but has not yet started processing it or that processing the request will take longer than a client is typically willing to wait for a response. A 2.06 response can include status information and indicate a location where the result will become available.</t>
