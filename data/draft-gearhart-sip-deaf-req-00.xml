    <abstract>
      <t>SIP is attracting more and more attention as a valuable tool to enable and support voice and multimedia communications over the Internet. However, a significant number of potential customers for SIP-based services are for various reasons unable to, or choose not to, use voice communication technologies. This document offers a proposed set of requirements and identifies some of the key issues that need resolution to allow full accessibility for this group to SIP-based Internet communications. This document is intended to continue the discussion begun in a previous draft (see Acknowledgements) and to lay a foundation for design and implementation discussions in future drafts.</t>
