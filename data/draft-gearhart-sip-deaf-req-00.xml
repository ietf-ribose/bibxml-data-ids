      <t>SIP is attracting more and more attention as a valuable tool toenable and support voice and multimedia communications over theInternet. However, a significant number of potential customersfor SIP-based services are for various reasons unable to, orchoose not to, use voice communication technologies. This documentoffers a proposed set of requirements and identifies some of thekey issues that need resolution to allow full accessibility forthis group to SIP-based Internet communications. This document isintended to continue the discussion begun in a previous draft (seeAcknowledgements) and to lay a foundation for design andimplementation discussions in future drafts.</t>
