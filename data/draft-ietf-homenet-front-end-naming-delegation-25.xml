    <abstract>
      <t>Home network owners may have devices or services hosted on this home network that they wish to access from the Internet (i.e., from a network outside of the home network). Home networks are increasingly numbered using IPv6 addresses, which makes this access much simpler. To enable this access, the names and IP addresses of these devices and services needs to be made available in the public DNS. The names and IP address of the home network are present in the Public Homenet Zone by the Homenet Naming Authority (HNA), which in turn instructs an outsourced infrastructure to publish the zone on the behalf of the home owner. This document describes how an this Home Naming Authority instructs the outsourced infrastructure.</t>
