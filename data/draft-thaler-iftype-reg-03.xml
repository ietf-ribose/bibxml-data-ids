      <t>The registration and use of interface types ("ifType" values) predated the use of IANA Considerations sections and YANG modules, and so confusion has arisen about the interface type allocation process. Tunnel types were then added later, with the same requirements and allocation policy as interface types. This document provides updated guidelines for the definition of new interface types and tunnel types, for consideration by those who are defining, registering, or evaluating those definitions.</t>
