      <t>This document describes a syntax for the Connect-Info attribute used with the Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) protocol, enabling clients to provide servers information pertaining to the operation of an IEEE 802.11 wireless network. The document has been developed by the Wireless Broadband Alliance's Access Network Metrics project team. This project was formed to addresses the adoption of RADIUS used to support Wi-Fi authentication in environments that are increasingly complex; with multiple possible overlapping networks, operating using different Wi-Fi technology generations, utilizing varied spectrum allocations, and where the AAA provider wants to ensure their users are getting a great Wi-Fi experience. In such environments, the Wi-Fi industry can benefit from a consistent framework that provides visibility of Wi-Fi network metrics, increasing confidence in Wi-Fi to support carrier use-cases, and consequently driving adoption. The use of a well defined syntax for the Connect-Info attribute that simultaneously supports existing Wi-Fi implementations while also addressing new requirements may have wider applicability by the broader Wi-Fi community. This document is an independent submission. It is not an IETF standard and does not have IETF consensus.</t>
