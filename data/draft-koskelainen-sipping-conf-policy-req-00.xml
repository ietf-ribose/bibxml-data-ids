      <t>The conference participants may communicate with the conference policy server, using a conference policy control protocol (CPCP) which is a strictly client-server transactional protocol. This document describes the requirements for conference policy data. Media policy related requirements are beyond the scope of this document. CPCP protocol is not mandatory and the only mechanism to manipulate conference policy data in a conference. For example, web interface can be used as well to perform conference policy manipulation. However, for automata a protocol is needed.</t>
