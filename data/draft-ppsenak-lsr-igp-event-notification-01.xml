    <abstract>
      <t>Link-state protocols like IS-IS and OSPF have been designed to distribute state information - state of the local adjacencies, state of the local prefix reachability, etc. Each state can have additional attributes associated with it, but all the attributes are only meaningful while the state exists. This document extends link-state IGPs to distribute event notifications. An event notification has a very limited lifetime. It is rapidly propagated across the network and leaves no state after its lifetime.</t>
