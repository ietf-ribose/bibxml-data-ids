      <t>This document defines extensions to RFC 4279, "Pre-Shared KeyCiphersuites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)", to enable dynamickey sharing in distributed environments using a Generic SecurityService Application Program Interface (GSS-API) mechanism, and thenimport that shared key as the "Pre-Shared Key" to complete the TLShandshake.This is a modular approach to perform authentication and key exchangebased on off-shelf libraries. And it obviates the need of pair-wisekey sharing by enabling the use of the widely-deployed Kerberos aliketrust infrastructures that are highly scalable and robust.Furthermore, conforming implementations can provide serverauthentication without the use of certificates.</t>
