      <t>Enhanced VPN (VPN+) as defined in I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn aims to provide enhanced VPN service to support applications's needs of enhanced isolation and stringent performance requirements. VPN+ requries integration between the overlay VPN and the underlay network. A Virtual Transport Network (VTN) is a virtual network which consists of a subset of the network toplogy and network resources allocated from the underlay network. A VTN could be used as the underlay for one or a group of VPN+ services. I-D.dong-idr-bgpls-sr-enhanced-vpn defines the BGP-LS extensions to distribute the information of Segment Routing (SR) based VTNs to external entities, such as the network controllers. This document describes a simplified mechanism to distribute the information of SR based VTNs using BGP-LS with Flex-Algo.</t>
