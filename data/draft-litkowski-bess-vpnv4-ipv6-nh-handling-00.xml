    <abstract>
      <t>RFC4364 and RFC4659 define respectively BGP extensions to provide VPN-IPv4 and VPN-IPv6 services. When defined RFC5549 has brought up an inconsistency in how the next hop is encoded when a VPN-IPv4 NLRI carries an IPv6 next hop compared to RFC4364 and RFC4659. For some reasons, existing and deployed implementations of RFC5549 haven't followed the specification and are using an VPN-IPv6 next hop as in RFC4364 and RFC4659. Moving these implementations to be compliant with RFC5549 may break existing network deployments. This document proposes a modification of RFC5549 to enable compliancy of these implementations. These document also proposes additional modifications of RFC5549 to address missing points.</t>
