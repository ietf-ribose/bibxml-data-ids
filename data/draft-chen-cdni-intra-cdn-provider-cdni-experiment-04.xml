      <t>In [RFC6770], the Inter-Affiliates CDN Interconnection use case is described. In this scenario, a large CDN Provider may have several autonomous or semi-autonomous subsidiaries that each operates on their own CDN. The CDN Provider needs to make these down-stream CDNs interoperate to provide a consistent service to its customers on the whole collective footprint. This document illustrates in details the CDNi experiment that has been carried out by China Telecom, and the lessons and experiences to CDNi standardization work.</t>
