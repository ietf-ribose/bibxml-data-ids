      <t>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User Agents (UA) receiveidentifiers for the caller and callee during call establishment.These identifiers can come in a variety of forms, can be delivered bya variety of means, and may or may not be accompanied by evidence ofauthenticity. Furthermore, if media are secured (e.g., using theSecure Real-Time Protocol, SRTP), the security properties of themedia will depend on binding the media to a received authenticatedidentifier. This document examines the various identificationinformation a UA can receive during call establishment and how a useragent can use this information to present a caller or calleeidentifier to the user and indicate to the user the securityproperties of the call, as well as how the user agent might use thisinformation for other purposes, such as authorizing acceptance of acall.This work is being discussed on the sip@ietf.org mailing list.</t>
