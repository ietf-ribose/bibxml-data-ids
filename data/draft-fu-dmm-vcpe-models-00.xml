      <t>This document introduces the concept of Virtual Customer Premises Equipment (VCPE). Such concept was first proposed in Broadband Forum (BBF) as Network Enhanced Residential Gateway (NERG). The VCPE is the Home Agent (HA) of the Mobile Nodes (MN) attached to the physical CPE (pCPE). In this document, we explain the motivation and advantages of VCPE. Three usecases of VCPE is further discussed in the enterprise network, the residential network, and the Internet of Things (IoT) Network. Two models of field deployment of VCPE are discussed afterwards. The models of VCPE decompose the Control Plane (CP) and the Data Plane (DP), which makes it easier for the deployment of the distributed mobility model.</t>
