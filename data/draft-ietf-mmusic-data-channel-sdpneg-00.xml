      <t>The Real-Time Communication in WEB-browsers (RTCWeb) working group is charged to provide protocols to support direct interactive rich communications using audio, video, and data between two peers' web- browsers. For the support of data communication, the RTCWeb working group has in particular defined the concept of bi-directional data channels over SCTP, where each data channel might be used to transport other protocols, called sub-protocols. Data channel setup can be done using either the internal in-band band (also referred to as 'internal' for the rest of the document) WebRTC Data Channel Establishment Protocol or some external out-of-band simply referred to as 'external negotiation' in the rest of the document . This document specifies how the SDP offer/answer exchange can be used to achieve such an external negotiation. Even though data channels are designed for RTCWeb use initially they may be used by other protocols like, but not limited to, the CLUE protocol. This document is intended to be used wherever data channels are used.</t>
