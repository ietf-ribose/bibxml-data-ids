    <abstract>
      <t>Network Anomaly Detection is the act of detecting problems in the network. Accurately detect problems is very challenging for network operators in production networks. Good results require a lot of expertise and knowledge around both the implied network technologies and the specific service provided to consumers, apart from a proper monitoring infrastructure. In order to facilitate network anomaly detection, novel techniques are being introduced, including programmatical, rule-based and AI-based, with the promise of improving scalability and the hope to keep a high detection accuracy. To guarantee acceptable results, the process needs to be properly designed, adopting well-defined stages to accurately collect evidence of anomalies, validate their relevancy and improve the detection systems over time, iteratively. This document describes the lifecycle process to iteratively improve network anomaly detection accurately. Three key stages are proposed, along with a YANG model specifying the required metadata for the network anomaly detection covering the exchange of information between different stages of the lifecycle.</t>
