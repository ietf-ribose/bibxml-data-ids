      <t>This document aims at identifying the requirements which should betaken into consideration by a service provider, when considering thedeployment of an IP VPN service offering. From this perspective,this document does not specify any technical means which could beused to deploy an IP VPN service offering, unlike the [VPN-FRAME]document.This document tries to express a service provider perspective,according to its own experience of IP-based service offerings, andto its own perception of the (constantly) evolving needs of thecustomers of such services. To some extent, this document can beviewed as a complementary taxonomy effort of the [TAXONOMY] draft.</t>
