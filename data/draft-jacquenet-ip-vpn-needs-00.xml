      <t>This document aims at identifying the requirements which should be taken into consideration by a service provider, when considering the deployment of an IP VPN service offering. From this perspective, this document does not specify any technical means which could be used to deploy an IP VPN service offering, unlike the [VPN-FRAME] document. This document tries to express a service provider perspective, according to its own experience of IP-based service offerings, and to its own perception of the (constantly) evolving needs of the customers of such services. To some extent, this document can be viewed as a complementary taxonomy effort of the [TAXONOMY] draft.</t>
