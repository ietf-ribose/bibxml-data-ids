      <t>A Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP) Pseudowire (PW) is a mechanism thatemulates the essential attributes of a unidirectional P2MPTelecommunications service such as P2MP ATM over a Packet SwitchedNetwork (PSN). One of the applicabilities of a P2MP PW is to delivera Layer 2 multicast service, that carries multicast frames (encodedusing Layer 2 or IP mechanisms) from a multicast source to one ormore multicast receivers.[RFC4664] describes a number of different ways in which sets of PWsmay be combined together into "Provider Provisioned Layer 2 VPNs" (L2PPVPNs, or L2VPNs), resulting in a number of different kinds ofL2VPN. P2MP PWs enable a L2VPN to provide a Virtual Private MulticastService (VPMS), which may be in addition to the Virtual Private WireService (VPWS) offered by the L2VPN. A VPMS is a L2VPN service thatprovides point-to-multipoint connectivity traffic to customers.VPMS framework and requirements are described in [VPLS-REQ]. One ofthe VPMS requirements is auto-discovery. This document describes howprocedures outlined in [VPLS-MCAST] can be used for auto-discovery(A-D) in VPMS using BGP. This document also describes BGP basedprocedures for P2MP PW signaling for VPMS that may be used when BGPis used for VPMS auto-discovery.</t>
