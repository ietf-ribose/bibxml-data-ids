      <t>This document specifies a grouping mechanism for RTP media streams that can be used to specify relations between media streams within different RTP sessions as well as within a single RTP session, and independently of whether these media streams are described within one SDP m-line or in multiple m-lines. This mechanism is used to signal the association between the RTP concept of SSRC and the WebRTC concept of "MediaStream" / "MediaStreamTrack" using SDP signaling. This document is a work item of the MMUSIC WG, whose discussion list is mmusic@ietf.org.</t>
