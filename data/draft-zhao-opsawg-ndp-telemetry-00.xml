      <t>As the scale of IP networks and the importance of services increase continuously, the data collected by telemetry is increasing exponentially. To support the network simulation, traffic optimization and risk detection of the network, Digital Twin technology on data communication networks is mentioned increasingly. Real-time synchronization between controllers and devices is a critical feature of Digital Twin Network, which require much more volume telemetry data between controllers and devices. All of these bring more pressure on the network bandwidth, device CPU and controller CPU. This document proposes a method to optimize the problem.</t>
