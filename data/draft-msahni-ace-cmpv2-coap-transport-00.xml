      <t>This document specifies how to use Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) as a Transport Medium for the Certificate management protocol version 2 (CMPv2) and Lightweight CMP Profile [Lightweight-CMP-Profile] which is a subset of CMPv2 defined for Constrained devices. The CMPv2 defines the interaction between various PKI entities for the purpose of certificate creation and management. The CoAP is a HTTP like client-server protocol used by various constrained devices in the IoT and industrial scenarios. Constrained devices are devices that have low memory or CPU or power constraints and avoid the use of complex protocols like TCP to save resources.</t>
