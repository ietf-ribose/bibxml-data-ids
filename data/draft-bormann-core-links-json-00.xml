      <t>Web Linking (RFC5988) provides a way to represent links between Web resources as well as the relations expressed by them and attributes of such a link. In constrained networks, a collection of Web links can be exchanged in the CoRE link format (I-D.ietf-core-link-format). Outside of constrained environments, it may be useful to represent these collections of Web links in JSON format (RFC4627). This specification defines a common format for representing Web links in JSON format.</t>
