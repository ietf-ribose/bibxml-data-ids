      <t>This document updates the TLS Encrypted ClientHello (ECH) specification [ECH-DRAFT] to support an implicit mode in ECH signaled by a new implicit_ech extension in ECHConfigContents. Clients that detect this extension override certain base ECH rules: * They MAY choose any outer SNI instead of public_name. * They MAY choose any value for the config_id without an application profile or being externally configured. * They MAY use another value than ECHConfig.contents.public_name in the "server_name" extension (rather than they SHOULD use it) Client-facing servers that include implicit_ech in the ECHConfig MUST accommodate flexible config_id usage as defined in Section 10.4. of [ECH-DRAFT]. This approach enables the removal of stable identifiers (fixed config ID and known public_name) that on-path adversaries can use to fingerprint a connection. This improves upon the "Do Not Stick Out" design goal from Section 10.10.4 of [ECH-DRAFT] by allowing clients to choose unpredictable identifiers on the wire in the scenario where the set of ECH configurations the client encounters is small and therefore popular public_name or config_id values "stick out". Note that this increases CPU usage in multi-key deployments because client-facing servers must perform uniform trial decryption to handle arbitrary config_id values.
