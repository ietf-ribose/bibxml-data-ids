    <abstract>
      <t>Currently OSPFv3 uses IPsec for authenticating protocol packets. However, there are some environments, e.g., Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs), where IPsec is difficult to configure and maintain, and this mechanism cannot be used. This draft proposes an alternative mechanism that can be used so that OSPFv3 does not depend upon IPsec for authentication.</t>
