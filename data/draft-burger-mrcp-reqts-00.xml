      <t>This document outlines the needs and requirements for a protocol to control distributed speech processing of audio streams. By speech processing, this document specifically means automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech. Other IETF protocols, such as SIP and RTSP, address rendezvous and control for generalized media streams. However, speech processing presents additional requirements that none of the extant IETF protocols address.</t>
