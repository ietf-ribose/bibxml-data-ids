    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an extension to the IS-IS protocol to add operational capabilities that allow for ease of management and control over IP prefix distribution within an IS-IS domain. The IS- IS protocol is specified in [1], with extensions for supporting IPv4 specified in [2] and further enhancements for Traffic Engineering [4] in [3] and [6]. This document enhances the IS-IS protocol by extending the information that a Intermediate System (IS) [router] can place in Link State Protocol Data Units (LSPs) as specified in [2]. This extension will provide operators with a mechanism to control IP prefix distribution throughout multi-level IS-IS domains. Additionally, the information can be placed in LSPs that have TLVs as yet undefined, if this information is used to convey the same meaning in such future TLVs as it is used in the currently defined TLVs.</t>
