      <t>This document describes an extension to the IS-IS protocol to addoperational capabilities that allow for ease of management andcontrol over IP prefix distribution within an IS-IS domain. The IS-IS protocol is specified in [1], with extensions for supporting IPv4specified in [2] and further enhancements for Traffic Engineering [4]in [3] and [6].This document enhances the IS-IS protocol by extending theinformation that a Intermediate System (IS) [router] can place inLink State Protocol Data Units (LSPs) as specified in [2]. Thisextension will provide operators with a mechanism to control IPprefix distribution throughout multi-level IS-IS domains.Additionally, the information can be placed in LSPs that have TLVs asyet undefined, if this information is used to convey the same meaningin such future TLVs as it is used in the currently defined TLVs.</t>
