      <t>The main job of a protocol specification is to document how theprotocol works. It is sometimes difficult to learn how a protocolworks from such a document, because there are so many details, andthe necessary formalism for accuracy makes a specification long andintimidating to read. What also is usually lost in the process ofcreating an RFC for a protocol is documentation of the tradeoffs thatwere considered when making controversial choices. Sometimes it ispossible to find this information on the email archives, but that isa daunting task. This document is intended to work both as atutorial to understanding IKEv2, and a summary of the controversialissues, with the reasoning on all sides of each issue. If anydifferences in details exist between this document and the IKEv2specification, the IKEv2 specification is authoritative. Thisdocument is intended only to make the IKEv2 specification moreunderstandable on the first reading, as well as documenting reasoningbehind decisions.</t>
