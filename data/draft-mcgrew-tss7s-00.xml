      <t>This document proposes the transport of SS7 signalling messages over IP in a way that utilizes the existing SS7 network (MTP and SCCP) layers to ensure 'carrier class' service as expected by existing users of SS7. The transport of SS7 user information could use TCP connections or UDP. The SS7 signalling messages would include ISUP or SCCP or, if the network services are not needed, could include only TCAP. Work should begin to define the necessary adaptation layers to make these transport methods possible.</t>
