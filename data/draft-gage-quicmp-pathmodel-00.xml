      <t>The path model used in the current MPQUIC draft binds a connection identifier to a path. In fact, the sequence number of a connection identifier is used as an implicit path identifier. This has a number of consequences that may cause MPQUIC to diverge from the principles of RFC9000. One of these consequences, for example, is to associate each connection with a different application data packet number space rather than maintaining a single application data packet number space across all connections as defined in RFC9000. This document proposes a different path model for Multipath QUIC using explicit path identifiers, enabling a multipath management framework that retains the principles and operations of RFC9000.</t>
