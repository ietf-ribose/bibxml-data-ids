      <t>This document describes the common operational environments of IPv4 Service Providers wanting to add IPv6 services to their service portfolio but not wanting (yet) to upgrade their IPv4 backbone to IPv6 routing. Two main transition scenarios are identified. We recommend that the 'MP-BGP over IPv6' and 'MP-BGP over IPv4' approaches defined in [BGP-TUNNEL] be respectively used for each of the two transition scenarios.</t>
