    <abstract>
      <t>This memo describes the requirements for securing IANA code point assignments before RFC publication. In particular, it describes the "early allocation" process that allows for temporary but renewable allocations from registries that would ordinarily require an IESG- approved Internet-Draft: namely, registries maintained in accordance with the "Standards Action," "IETF Review," "RFC Required," and, in some cases, "Specification Required" policies. This process can be used when code point allocation is needed to facilitate desired or required implementation and deployment experience prior to publication. The procedures in this document are intended to apply only to IETF Stream documents. This document obsoletes RFC 7120.</t>
