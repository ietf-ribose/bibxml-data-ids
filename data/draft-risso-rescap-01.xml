      <t>This document details a protocol that can be used to capture and sample frames on a remote device. This protocol could be a possible solution for the 'Report format and report stream format document' milestone of the PSAMP Working Group. This protocol defines a control connection, which is used to control the remote device, and a data connection, which is used to transport back the sampled data. This protocol includes has a set of optional parameters that allows customizing the behavior of the sampling process. This protocol can be used also for packet capture and it should be possible to implement it on both network devices (router and switches) and workstation hosts.</t>
