      <t>By collocating servers at base stations, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)provides low latency to users for real time applications such asVirtual Reality and Augmented Reality. To satisfy the growing demandof users, base stations are deployed densely in highly populatedareas. Coordinated Multipoint Transmission (CoMP) allows users toconnect to multiple base stations simultaneously. In ultra-densenetworks, by offloading the partials of tasks to different basestations, users can achieve lower latency and utilize the computationability of the surrounding base stations. To control the signalingoverhead, the number of base stations that can be connected should belimited. In this paper, we propose a user-centric base stationassignment algorithm by considering the possible load of basestations. Moreover, a partial task offloading algorithm is proposedto utilize the computation of under-loaded base stations. Resourceallocation is then solved by convex optimization.</t>
