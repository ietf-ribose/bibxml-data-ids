    <abstract>
      <t>This document introduces alternate ways to perform certain operations defined in RFC6378, "MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) Linear Protection", and also defines additional behaviors. This set of modified and additional behaviors together with the protocol defined in RFC6378 meets the ITU-T's protection switching requirements. This document introduces capabilities and modes. A capability is an individual behavior. The capabilities of a node are advertised using the method given in this document. A mode is a particular combination of capabilities. Two modes are defined in this document: Protection State Coordination (PSC) mode and Automatic Protection Switching (APS) mode. This document describes the behavior of the PSC protocol including priority logic and state machine when all the capabilities associated with the APS mode are enabled. This document updates RFC6378 in that the capability advertisement method defined here is an addition to that document.</t>
