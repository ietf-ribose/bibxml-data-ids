      <t>The great advance in telecommunications techniques to increase the level of reliability on the physical layer (Packet Loss) has made a tremendous contribution to the way higher layer protocols are designed nowadays. The High-Level Logical Link Control (HLLC) is intended for use as a highly reliable and fast host-to-host protocol between hosts current packet-switched computer communication networks. This document describes the functions to be performed by the High-Level Logical Link Control, the program that implements it, and its interface to programs or users that require its services.</t>
