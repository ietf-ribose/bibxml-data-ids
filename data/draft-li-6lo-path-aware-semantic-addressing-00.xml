    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a topological addressing scheme, Path-Aware Semantic Addressing (PASA) that enables IP packet transmission over links where the transmission of a full length address may not be desirable. Furthermore, packet forwarding is stateless, meaning that no routing table needs to be built, rather, the forwarding decision is based solely on the destination address structure. This document focuses on carrying IP packets across an LLN (Low power and Lossy Network), in which the topology is static, where nodes' location is fixed, and the connection between nodes is also rather stable. This specifications details the PASA architecture, address allocation, forwarding mechanism, header format design, including length-variable fields, and IPv6 interconnection support.</t>
