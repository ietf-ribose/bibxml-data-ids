      <t>In order for virtual assets to be traded or exchanged within online transactions, the parties involved in the transaction must have share a common definition of what constitute the virtual asset. Parties transacting on a DLT system must have the unambiguous means to refer to a common definition of an virtual asset, independent of the implementation of the virtual asset in question. This specification defines a JSON representation of a number of common information fields within asset profiles.</t>
