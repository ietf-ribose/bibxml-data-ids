    <abstract>
      <t>Currently, there are transport applications that have specific demands on a communication network. This document describes the APONF basic architecture, its elements and interfaces. The main APONF architecture entity is the Application-based Policy Decision (ABPD), which supports groups/classes of application models. Each of these models supports application demands that are similar in nature and therefore can be grouped/classified together. Moreover, the ABPD maps the classified application models into network capabilities, e.g., network management and traffic policies.</t>
