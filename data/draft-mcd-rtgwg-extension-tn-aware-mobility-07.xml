    <abstract>
      <t>The existing Transport Network Aware Mobility for 5G [TN-AWARE- MOBILITY] draft specifies a framework for mapping the 5G mobile systems' Slice and Service Types (SSTs) to corresponding underlying network paths between gNBs (generalized Node-B) and UPFs (User Plane Functions).The focus of that work is limited to the 3GPP domain (i.e., gNB &lt;-&gt; UPFs) and doesn't cover the network between the UPFs and the services hosted in data centers. This document describes a framework for extending the mobility-aware transport network characteristics from the 3GPP domain through the IP Data Networks to the service destinations. Extending the framework to the data centers where the services are hosted becomes necessary to maintain the end-to-end transport network characteristics between UEs and their application servers.</t>
