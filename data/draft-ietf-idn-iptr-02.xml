      <t>This draft attempts to address the problem of how an IP address should be properly mapped to a set of internationalized domain names(iDNs). It is currently unspecified how a PTR record can be used for this purpose. In addition, the syntax of the PTR resource record may be too restrictive for such a mapping in a more culturally meaningful context. This document suggests a new TYPE called IPTR using EDNS0 and a mechanism to combind language information with such a mapping.</t>
