      <t>This draft presents the ongoing work in ITU-T SG2 Question 2/2 on Recommendation E.351 'Routing of Multimedia Connections Across TDM-, ATM-, and IP-based Networks.' There are many network operators who have implemented multiple networks using different network-layer (layer-3) routing protocols, which include TDM-, ATM-, and/or IP-based technology. Rapid growth of multimedia IP-based services has led in turn to ATM and IP technology being implemented and/or planned for PSTNs. Established routing methods are recommended for application across network types (summarized in Table 1 of the Recommendation), and include the following: a) E.164/NSAP based number translation/routing, b) automatic generation of routing tables based on network topology and status, c) automatic update and synchronization of topology databases, d) dynamic route selection, and e)QoS resource management. Signaling and information-exchange requirements needed to support these routing methods are recommended, and include the connectivity management and routing policy parameters summarized in Table 4 of the Recommendation.</t>
