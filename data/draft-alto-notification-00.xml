      <t>Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) guides an application,especially a Peer to Peer (P2P) application, to select hosts fromits candidate set. ALTO is a promising technique for future network,as it is able to jointly optimize network resource utilization andapplication performance. The ALTO protocol is Client-Server based.Applications work as ALTO clients to fetch PID information from theALTO server, but the ALTO server can't send the notification to ALTOclients, even if there is a major change to the networks. This draftdiscusses the requirements for server initialized notification, andproposes one mechanism to enable the ALTO server notification.</t>
