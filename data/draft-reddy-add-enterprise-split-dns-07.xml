    <abstract>
      <t>When split-horizon DNS is deployed by a network, certain domains are only resolvable by querying the network-designated DNS server rather than a public DNS server. DNS clients which use DNS servers not provided by the network need to route those DNS domain queries to the network-designated DNS server. This document informs DNS clients of split-horizon DNS, their DNS domains, and is compatible with encrypted DNS.</t>
