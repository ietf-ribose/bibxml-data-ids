      <t>Mobile IP is now being deployed, providing connectivity to mobileusers. This is happening well ahead of the widespread use of IPv6,which may not have been expected at the time when the Mobile IPstandard was originally formulated. At the same time, networks withprivate address spaces are proliferating, using NAT devices to reachthe public internet. Today NATs are widely deployed in homegateways, as well as in other locations likely to be used by mobileusers, such as hotels. The result is that MIP-NAT incompatibilityissues have become a major barrier to deployment of Mobile IP in oneof its principal uses. This draft describes a known incompatibilitybetween NAT and Mobile IP, and also describes a possible solutionusing Mobile IP's vendor specific extensions.</t>
