      <t>This document reports and discusses issues on IPv6 only networks and IPv4/IPv6 transition technologies through our experiences on the 2nd experiment on the WIDE camp. The second experiment was held from March 4th to March 8th, 2012. We tried to live in commercial IPv6 networks with four kinds of IPv4/IPv6 transition technologies, DNS64/ NAT64, 4RD, 464XLAT and SA46T. In this -01.txt aims to report results of the 2nd experiment and to share issues / problems on the IPv4 / IPv6 transition that we met.</t>
