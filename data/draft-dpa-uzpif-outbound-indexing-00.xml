    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes an outbound, opt-in mechanism for web content discovery and indexing, complementing or replacing traditional inbound crawling models such as those governed by the Robots Exclusion Protocol (REP; [RFC9309]). In the proposed approach, servers proactively initiate authenticated outbound connections to trusted indexers (search engines or AI systems) using identity-bound grants, enabling explicit consent for indexing, freshness signalling, and content usage policy communication. The mechanism integrates with identity-centric frameworks such as the Universal Zero-Port Interconnect Framework (UZPIF; [UZPIF]) and supports both traditional search engines and AI-driven indexing and retrieval systems. It aims to reduce unsolicited crawling abuse, improve signal quality for indexers, and provide site owners with positive control over discoverability in an era of increasing AI content consumption.</t>
