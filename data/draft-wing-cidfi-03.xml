    <abstract>
      <t>Host-to-network signaling and network-to-host signaling can improve the user experience to adapt to network's constraints and share expected application needs, and thus to provide differentiated service to a flow and to packets within a flow. The differentiated service may be provided at the network (e.g., packet prioritization), the server (e.g., adaptive transmission), or both. This document describes how clients can communicate with their nearby network elements so their QUIC and DTLS streams can be augmented with information about network conditions and packet importance to meet both intentional and reactive management policies. With optional server support individual packets can receive differentiated service. The proposed approach covers both directions of a flow.</t>
