      <t>This document provides an overview of the attribute types and objectclasses defined by the ISO/IEC JTC1 and ITU-T committees in the IS0/IEC 9594 and X.500 documents, in particular those intended for use by directory clients. This is the most widely used schema for LDAP/X.500 directories, and many other schema definitions for white pages objects use it as a basis. This document does not cover attributes used for the administration of X.500 directory servers, nor does it include attributes defined by other ISO/ITU-T documents.</t>
