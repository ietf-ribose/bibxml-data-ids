      <t>The ANSI X3T9.3 committee has drafted a proposal for the encapsulation of IEEE 802.2 LLC PDUs and, by implication, IP on HIPPI. Another X3T9.3 draft describes the operation of HIPPI physical switches. X3T9.3 chose to leave HIPPI networking issues largely outside the scope of their standards; this document discusses methods of using of ANSI standard HIPPI hardware and protocols in the context of the Internet, including the use of HIPPI switches as LANs and interoperation with other networks. This memo is intended to become an Internet Standard. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>
