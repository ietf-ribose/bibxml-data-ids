    <title>An Approach to CO/CL Interworking  -- Part III: The Long-Term -- Conventions for Network-Layer Relays and Transport-Service Bridges in the presence of Internetworking</title>
    <date year="1991" month="April" day="25"/>
    <abstract>
      <t>The long-term approach is based on the use of transport-layer relays known as transport service bridges, or TS-bridges. Further, the long-term approach also assumes that knowledge of the TS-bridges is hidden from the end-systems. The companion memo identifies the short-term approach towards TS-bridges. The purpose of this memo is three-fold: first, to identify the infrastructure which is expected to exist in the long-term; second, to describe the use of NL-relays in such an environment. And, third, to describe the use of TS-bridges in such an environment.</t>
