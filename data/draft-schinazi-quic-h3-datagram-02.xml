      <t>The QUIC DATAGRAM extension provides application protocols running over QUIC with a mechanism to send unreliable data while leveraging the security and congestion-control properties of QUIC. However, QUIC DATAGRAM frames do not provide a means to demultiplex application contexts. This document defines how to use QUIC DATAGRAM frames when the application protocol running over QUIC is HTTP/3 by adding an identifier at the start of the frame payload. Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the QUIC IETF mailing list quic@ietf.org [1] or on the GitHub repository which contains the draft: https://github.com/DavidSchinazi/draft- h3-datagram [2].</t>
