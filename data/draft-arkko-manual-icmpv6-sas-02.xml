      <t>This informational document discusses the use of manually configuredIPsec security associations to protect IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND)messages. IPsec security associations are generally identified bythe triple (security parameters index, destination address,protocol). In the case of Neighbor Discovery, configuring theseassociations requires some effort, however. There are multiple knowndestination addresses plus a number of addresses that depend on thephysical link addresses. This document describes the securityimplications of protecting or not protecting the Neighbor Discoverymessages and lists the security associations that must be configuredmanually. The presented method is applicable only in small networks,but some approaches for reducing the configuration effort arediscussed.</t>
