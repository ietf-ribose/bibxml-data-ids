    <abstract>
      <t>As Internet audience sizes for high-interest live events reach unprecedented levels and bitrates climb to support 4K/8K/AR, live streaming can place a unique type of stress upon network resources. TreeDN is a tree-based CDN architecture designed to address the distinctive scaling challenges of live streaming to mass audiences. TreeDN enables operators to offer Replication-as-a-Service (RaaS) at a fraction the cost of traditional, unicast-based CDNs- in some cases, at no additional cost to the infrastructure. In addition to efficiently utilizing network resources to deliver existing multi- destination traffic, this architecture also enables new types of content and use cases that previously werenâ€™t possible or economically viable using traditional CDN approaches. Finally, TreeDN is a decentralized architecture and a democratizing technology for content distribution.</t>
