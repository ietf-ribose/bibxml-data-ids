      <t>The WebDAV protocol defines facilities for adding properties to Web resources. These properties consist of name/value pairs interchanged using XML. The protocol includes the PROPFIND method for accessing properties, and the PROPPATCH method for updating and removing properties. Experience building both WebDAV clients and a WebDAV server indicates the need for three minor extensions to the current properties protocol: 1) allow PROPPATCH to create and initialize the properties of a resource that did not exist, 2) distinguish between adding a new property, and setting the value of an existing property of a resource, and 3) give client applications more control in specifying how PROPPATCH errors should be handled.</t>
