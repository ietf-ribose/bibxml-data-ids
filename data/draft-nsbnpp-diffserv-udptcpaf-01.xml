      <t>This informational draft presents results of a study on usingdifferent drop precedence assignments to address fairness issues whenUDP and TCP traffic share the same Assured Forwarding (AF) PHB class.In particular, six different possible combinations of drop precedenceassignment were explored with two different models of RED parametersettings. We present results showing that the type of RED modelutilized can play a role in the nature of bandwidth sharing betweenTCP and UDP flows. The results also show that with the current fourClass, three Drop Precedence AF specification, complete fairnessbetween TCP and UDP cannot be completely achieved using separate dropprecedence assignment. This is true for both under-provisionednetworks and over-provisioned networks. Certain drop precedencemapping schemes are beneficial to TCP while others are beneficial forUDP.</t>
