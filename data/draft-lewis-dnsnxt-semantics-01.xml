      <t>In 'Domain Name System Security Extensions' (RFC 2065) the NXT Resource Record (along with SIG RR and KEY RR) is introduced to allow for secure denial of existence of either a domain name or a RRSet belonging to an existing domain name. The set of NXT records within a zone create a virtual 'chain' of RRSets within a zone by indicating, for each name within a zone, the RRSets for which it owns records and the next name in the zone. RFC 2065 discusses security extensions for static DNS zones. An Internet Draft, draft-ietf-dnssec-update-04.txt, becoming an RFC describes security in DNS zone which can be dynamically updated. In this document, the authors build upon them to: - define some terms used colloquially in the working group - describe the semantics of the NXT record in greater detail than the two existing documents, in order to achieve interoperability - introduce and discuss unresolved issues involving NXT records</t>
