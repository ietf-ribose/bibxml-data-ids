      <t>This document describes means of generating Uniform Data Fingerprint (UDF) values and their presentation as text sequences and as URIs. Cryptographic digests provide a means of uniquely identifying static data without the need for a registration authority. A fingerprint is a form of presenting a cryptographic digest that makes it suitable for use in applications where human readability is required. The UDF fingerprint format improves over existing formats through the introduction of a compact algorithm identifier affording an intentionally limited choice of digest algorithm and the inclusion of an IANA registered MIME Content-Type identifier within the scope of the digest input to allow the use of a single fingerprint format in multiple application domains. Alternative means of rendering fingerprint values are considered including machine-readable codes, word and image lists.</t>
