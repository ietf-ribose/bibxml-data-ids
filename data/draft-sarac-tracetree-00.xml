      <t>This document describes a new mechanism for discovering multicast tree topology in the network. It uses the existing multicast forwarding state information to discovery tree topology in the source-to-receiver(s) direction. Scalability is provided by using a modified version of standard TTL based scoping. This draft identifies important issues necessary for discovering tree topology in the source-to-receiver(s) direction and discusses potential solutions to handle them.</t>
