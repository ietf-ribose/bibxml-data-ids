    <abstract>
      <t>The Constrained Resource Identifier (CRI) is a complement to the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that represents the URI components in Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) instead of in a sequence of characters. This simplifies parsing, comparison, and reference resolution in environments with severe limitations on processing power, code size, and memory size. This RFC updates RFC 7595 to add a note on how the URI Schemes registry RFC 7595 describes cooperates with the CRI Scheme Numbers registry created by the present RFC. // (This "cref" paragraph will be removed by the RFC editor:) The // present revision –16 of this draft continues -15 by picking up // more comments; it was made specifically for IETF 120. This // revision still contains open issues and is intended to serve as a // snapshot.</t>
