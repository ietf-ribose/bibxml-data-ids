      <t>Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) makes expression of domain name rich. The demand for such enrichment is to use native language characters in a domain name. IDN itself has no locale dependency as a protocol, but to utilize IDN in the real world, language and/or regional aspects should be taken into account. This document explains a guideline to any IDN zone administrator who accepts Japanese as an IDN label.</t>
