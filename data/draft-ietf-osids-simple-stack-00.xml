      <t>This document specifies a mapping of protocols defined by the Abstract Service Description Conventions onto Connection Oriented Transport Service, Connectionless Transport Service, TCP, and UDP [MHS88b]. This mapping will support all ROS (Remote Operation Service) based protocols, such as directory, both with and without use of RTS (Reliable Transfer Service), and all of the X.400 services [ISO88, CCI88, MHS88a]. Four example applications of the Simple OSI Stack (SOS) are given in appendices. These are all ``real'' examples, which will are quite likely to evolve into formal specifications. They are intended to show that specification of SOS applications is very straightforward and useful. These examples will be dropped from future versions of this document, and perhaps be replaced by artificial examples.</t>
