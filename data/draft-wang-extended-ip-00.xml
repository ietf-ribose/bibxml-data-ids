    <abstract>
      <t>In this paper, we present the Extended Internet Protocol (EIP) which provides a long-term solution to Internet address exhaustion. What we propose here is not a new addressing and routing scheme, but a framework in which any addressing and routing schemes can be accommodated. The goal of EIP is to provide maximum flexibility to accommodate any addressing and routing schemes yet to maintain maximum backward compatibility with current IP. It can substantially reduce the amount of modifications needed to the current Internet systems and greatly ease the difficulties of transition. This is an 'idea' paper and discussion is strongly encouraged on Big-Internet@munnari.oz.au.</t>
