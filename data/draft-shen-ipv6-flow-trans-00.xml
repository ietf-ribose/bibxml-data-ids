      <t>This draft proposes a Mobile IPv6 and RSVP interworking scheme. Inthis scheme, the underlying mobility support mechanism is required toprovide a unique flow identity regardless of node mobility, makingnode mobility transparent to flow QoS handling mechanisms. Thus QoSsignaling delay as well as data packet delays and losses duringhandoff can be reduced. We also discuss solutions to achieve thisscheme which utilizes the new IPv6 flow label. Finally, issuesrelated to security and scalability will also be considered.</t>
