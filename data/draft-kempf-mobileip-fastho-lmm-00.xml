    <title>Leveraging Fast Handover Protocols to Support Localized Mobility Management in Mobile IP</title>
    <date year="2002" month="June" day="5"/>
    <abstract>
      <t>Longstanding work in the Mobile IP Working Group has been directed at enhancements to Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6 to reduce the amount of latency in binding updates sent to the Home Agent and, for route- optimization, Correspondent Nodes, upon Care of Address change. In cases where the Home Agent and Mobile Node are separated by continental or transcontinental distances, this latency can be rather high and can interfere with the Mobile Node receiving its traffic upon Care of Address change when break-before-make handover is required. This draft discusses a solution that leverages the more recent fast handover work and mechanisms already described in the protocol specifications for Mobile IPv6 and the route optimization extension of Mobile IPv4. This alternative has certain simplicity, scalability, and robustness advantages over a design that incorporates additional mobility agents, and requires no additional mechanism in the network or change to the Mobile Node beyond that required to support these protocols.</t>
