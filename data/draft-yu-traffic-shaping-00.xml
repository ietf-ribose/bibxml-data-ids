    <abstract>
      <t>Starting from the traffic shaping mechanism, one of the core technologies of network deterministic assurance, we summarize the characteristics of different traffic scheduling and shaping methods and propose a solution design for IPv6 to carry these traffic scheduling and shaping methods, taking into account deterministic and security factors. At the same time, the network scope of practical applications is becoming larger and larger, and the demand for deterministic network services will no longer be restricted to LANs, but will require deterministic forwarding beyond LAN boundaries, extending the deterministic assurance capability previously provided in LANs to WANs through network layer technologies.</t>
