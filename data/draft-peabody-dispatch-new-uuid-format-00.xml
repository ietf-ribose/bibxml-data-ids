      <t>This document presents a new UUID format (version 6) which is suited for use as a database key. A common case for modern applications is to create a unique identifier to be used as a primary key in a database table that is ordered by creation time, difficult to guess and has a compact text format. None of the existing UUID versions fulfill each of these requirements. This document is a proposal to update RFC4122 with a new UUID version that addresses these concerns.</t>
