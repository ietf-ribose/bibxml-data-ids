      <t>This document specifies the behavior that is expected from the Domain Name System with regard to DNS queries for names ending with '.homenet.', thereby defining this top-level domain as a special-use domain name [RFC6761]. The '.homenet' top-level domain intends to replace '.home' which was originally proposed in [RFC7788] as default domain-name for home networks.</t>
