    <abstract>
      <t>Many service providers have been exploring distributed computing techniques to achieve better service response time and optimized energy consumption. Such techniques rely upon the distribution of computing services and capabilities over many locations in the network, such as its edge, the metro region, virtualized central office, and other locations. In such a distributed computing environment, providing services by utilizing computing resources hosted in various computing facilities (e.g., edges) is being considered, e.g., for computationally intensive and delay sensitive services. Ideally, services should be computationally balanced using service-specific metrics instead of simply dispatching the service requests in a static way or optimizing solely connectivity metrics. For example, systematically directing end user-originated service requests to the geographically closest edge or some small computing units may lead to an unbalanced usage of computing resources, which may then degrade both the user experience and the overall service performance. This document provides an overview of scenarios and problems associated with realizing such scenarios, identifying key engineering investigation areas which require adequate architectures and protocols to achieve balanced computing and networking resource utilization among facilities providing the services.</t>
