      <t>This document specifies a methodology for measurement of the IETF IPPM WG's one-way IP performance metrics such as one-way delay and jitter of subpaths consisting of a specific end-to-end path in IPv6 network as well as end-to-end one-way IP performance metrics. The methodology measures one-way IP performance metrics in use of IPv6 source routing through IPv6 extension headers. Because the methodology can contribute to the finding of congested link or underutilized link, it can provide important information to configure and manage IPv6 network.</t>
