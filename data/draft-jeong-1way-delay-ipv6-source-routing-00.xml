      <t>This document specifies a methodology for measurement of the IETFIPPM WG's one-way IP performance metrics such as one-way delay andjitter of subpaths consisting of a specific end-to-end path in IPv6network as well as end-to-end one-way IP performance metrics. Themethodology measures one-way IP performance metrics in use of IPv6source routing through IPv6 extension headers. Because themethodology can contribute to the finding of congested link orunderutilized link, it can provide important information toconfigure and manage IPv6 network.</t>
