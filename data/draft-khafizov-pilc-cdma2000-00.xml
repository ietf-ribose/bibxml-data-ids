      <t>The purpose of this document is to inform the Internet community of the TCP optimization techniques that were found useful for transmitting data over the CDMA2000 1x network. Our recommendations are based on lab measurements and simulations of FTP data transmissions over the CDMA2000 1x systems. Same recommendations could be applicable to networks with similar characteristics (e.g., W-CDMA, GPRS, etc.) and therefore could be incorporated into the existing document addressing performance implications of 2.5G/3G networks [3]. This document does not specify an Internet standard and it does not propose any changes to an Internet standard.</t>
