      <t>Mobile IPv6 defines a return-routability procedure for secure use ofroute optimization between unacquainted nodes. Unfortunately, thisprocedure is known to have undesired impacts on handoff latency.This document specifies extensions to Mobile IPv6 that eliminate thelatency of the return-routability procedure. The extensions thusprovide a basis for more efficient reactive as well as proactivehandoff management. They are optional and fully backward-compatible.</t>
