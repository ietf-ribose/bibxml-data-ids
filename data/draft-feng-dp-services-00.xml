      <t>Drop preference has been proposed as a possible means for providing differentiated services in the Internet. Used as a parameter in a PHB group, drop preference can provide weighted bandwidth sharing amongst flows and flow aggregates of a PHB group. This memo documents a number of services which can be implemented using either a single drop preference PHB setting or multiple drop preference settings.</t>
