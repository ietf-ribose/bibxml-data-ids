      <t>With operating systems appearing in more and more devices, as wellas computers appearing in more and more aspects of everyday life,communication between networked devices is increasingly important.The communication mechanism between these devices must be able tonot only support the office LAN environment, but must also scale tolarger WANS and the internet.This draft describes a method by which a host may automatically giveitself a link-local IPv4 address, so that it will be able to use IPapplications in the absence of an IP address management mechanism,such as DHCP. This mechanism is in use today by a few operatingsystems, and additional information on those implementations is alsoprovided.</t>
