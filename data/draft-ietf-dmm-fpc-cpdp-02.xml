      <t>This specification supports the separation of the Control-Plane for mobility- and session management from the Data-Plane. The protocol semantics abstract the configuration of Data-Plane nodes and applies it between a Client function, which is used by an application of the mobility Control-Plane, and an Agent function, which is associated with the configuration of Data-Plane nodes, according to the Data- Plane rules issued by the mobility Control-Plane. The scope of the rules comprises traffic description and treatment of packets in terms of encapsulation, IP address re-writing and QoS. Additional protocol semantics are described to support the maintenance of the Data-Plane path.</t>
