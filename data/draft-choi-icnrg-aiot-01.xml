      <t>This document describes the requirements and challenges to employ artificialintelligence (AI) into the constraint Internet of Things (IoT) service environment forembedding intelligence and increasing efficiency. The IoT service environment includes heterogeneous and multiple IoT devices andsystems that work together in a cooperative and intelligent way to manage homes, buildings,and complex autonomous systems. Therefore, it is becoming very essential to integrate IoTand AI technologies to increase the synergy between them. However, there areseveral limitations to achieve AI enabled IoT as the availability of IoT devices is not alwayshigh, and IoT networks cannot guarantee a certain level of performance in real-timeapplications due to resource constraints. This document intends to present a right direction to empower AI in IoT for learningand analyzing the usage behaviors of IoT devices/systems and human behaviors basedon previous records and experiences. With AI enabled IoT, the IoT service environment canbe intelligently managed in order to compensate for the unexpected performancedegradation often caused by abnormal situations.
