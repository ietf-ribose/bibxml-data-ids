      <t>This draft describes a metric, based on the minimal longest ascending subsequence (MLAS), which can be used to measure the level of reorderedness of a given single sequence of packets transmitted by one host and received by a second. This metric enables reordering between similar packet flows to be compared across differing network topologies. The draft goes on to provide a set of recommended parameters which can be used when attempting to consistently compare reordering, and highlights potential issues which should be taken into account during measurement.</t>
