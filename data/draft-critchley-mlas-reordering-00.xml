      <t>This draft describes a metric, based on the minimal longest ascendingsubsequence (MLAS), which can be used to measure the level ofreorderedness of a given single sequence of packets transmitted by onehost and received by a second. This metric enables reordering betweensimilar packet flows to be compared across differing networktopologies. The draft goes on to provide a set of recommendedparameters which can be used when attempting to consistently comparereordering, and highlights potential issues which should be taken intoaccount during measurement.</t>
