    <abstract>
      <t>This specification describes a new mobile network architecture which improves mobility management using Identifier Locator Addressing ILA) in IPv6 for next generation mobile telecommunication networks such as 5G and Mobile Edge Clouds. Identifier-locator addressing differentiates between location and identity of a addressable network element, which can be a mobile device or a data center task. The approach presented in this draft enables mobility management on Layer 3, and provides a simplified, GTP-tunnel-free and more efficient architecture with less core network utilization compared to traditional architecture.</t>
