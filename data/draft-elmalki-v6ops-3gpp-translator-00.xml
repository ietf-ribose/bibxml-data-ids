      <t>There have been discussions on the v6ops mailing list and at IETF meetings regarding the suitability of translators (e.g. NAT-PT) as mechanisms for IPv4 to IPv6 transition. It has often been stated that NAT-PT is not a mechanism to be recommended in general to solve the IPv6-IPv4 transition problem and some modifications to NAT-PT have been proposed. However there have also been discussions regarding special scenarios where some form of translators could be deployed if their use is documented appropriately. The aim of this draft is to document the rationale for using translators in 3GPP networks, in particular for IPv6-only IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) and to describe possible solutions to the problem and the interactions with SIP.</t>
