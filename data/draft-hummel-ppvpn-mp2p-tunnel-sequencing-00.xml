      <t>In order to provide any-CE-to-any-CE connectivity it is proposed todeploy an O(n)-sized set of base tunnels which form a reasonablepartial mesh (e.g. chessboard topology), and to use them and re-usethem many times as elements of concatenated hierarchical multipoint-to-point tunnel sequence LSPs. The number of saved tunnels is oforder n-square. Multiple,differently routed tunnel sequence LSPs butrooted at the same node may cater for features like trafficbalancing, path protection, QoS-routing, etc., without needing anyextra tunnel. It is outlined how to establish such an optimal VPNinter-site tunneling.</t>
