      <t>This memo defines the Extensible Protocol (XP). XP is a generic application-level protocol meant to serve as the foundation for specific protocols, in a manner analogous to the way in which the Extensible Markup Language (XML) recommendation of the World Wide Web Consortium serves as the foundation for specific markup languages. XP is a bidirectional protocol on which XML documents are exchanged between two endpoints.</t>
