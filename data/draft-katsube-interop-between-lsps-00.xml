      <t>Label Switching Routers are able to handle several distinct types of Label Switched Paths (LSPs) depending on the triggers for establishing or releasing LSPs or the granularity of the flow that are dedicated to each of the LSPs. This memo first analyzes characteristics of individual types of LSPs, and discusses possible interoperation scenario between them.</t>
