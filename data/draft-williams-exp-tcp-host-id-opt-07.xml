    <abstract>
      <t>Recent proposals discussed in the IETF have identified benefits to more distinctly identifying the hosts that are hidden behind a shared address/prefix sharing device or application-layer proxy. Analysis indicates that the use of a TCP option for this purpose can be successfully applied to some use cases. This document discusses design, deployment, and privacy considerations for such a TCP option that is in operational use on the Internet today.</t>
