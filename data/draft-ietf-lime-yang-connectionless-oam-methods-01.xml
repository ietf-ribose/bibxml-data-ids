    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents a retrieval method YANG Data model for connectionless OAM protocols. It provides a technology-independent RPC commands for connectionless OAM protocols. The retrieval methods model presented here can be extended to include technology specific details. This is leading to uniformity between OAM protocols and support both nested OAM workflows (i.e., performing OAM functions at different levels through a unified interface) and interactive OAM workflows ( i.e., performing OAM functions at same levels through a unified interface).</t>
