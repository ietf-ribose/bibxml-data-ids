      <t>This document describes the implementation of password policy inNetscape LDAP directories, and introduces two new object classes,twenty-three new attribute types, and two new controls in support ofpassword policy. Password policy is a set of rules that control how passwords are used inLDAP directories. In order to improve the security of LDAP directoriesand make it difficult for password cracking programs to break intodirectories, it is desirable to enforce a set of rules on passwordusage. These rules are made to ensure that the users change their pass-words periodically, the new password meets construction requirements,the re-use of the old password is restricted, and lock out the usersafter a certain number of bad password attempts.</t>
