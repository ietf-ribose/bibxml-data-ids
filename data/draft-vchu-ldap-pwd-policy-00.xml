    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the implementation of password policy in Netscape LDAP directories, and introduces two new object classes, twenty-three new attribute types, and two new controls in support of password policy. Password policy is a set of rules that control how passwords are used in LDAP directories. In order to improve the security of LDAP directories and make it difficult for password cracking programs to break into directories, it is desirable to enforce a set of rules on password usage. These rules are made to ensure that the users change their pass- words periodically, the new password meets construction requirements, the re-use of the old password is restricted, and lock out the users after a certain number of bad password attempts.</t>
