      <t>This document justifies the need and lists the requirements forcorrelating SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) dialogs. Thecorrelated dialogs may or may not be related to the same multimediasession. Being able to logically correlate multiple SIP dialogs isuseful for applications that, for different reasons, need toestablish several SIP dialogs to provide a given service. Thelogical correlation of two SIP dialogs is also useful, for instance,to correlate an incoming with an outgoing dialog at a B2BUA.</t>
