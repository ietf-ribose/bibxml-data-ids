      <t>This document justifies the need and lists the requirements for correlating SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) dialogs. The correlated dialogs may or may not be related to the same multimedia session. Being able to logically correlate multiple SIP dialogs is useful for applications that, for different reasons, need to establish several SIP dialogs to provide a given service. The logical correlation of two SIP dialogs is also useful, for instance, to correlate an incoming with an outgoing dialog at a B2BUA.</t>
