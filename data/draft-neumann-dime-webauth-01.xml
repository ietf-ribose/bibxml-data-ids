      <t>This document specifies the Diameter Application for Authentication and Authorization in Web Applications (Diameter WebAuth). This Diameter application is intended to be used by Diameter clients to perform authentication and authorization operations with a Diameter server in web-based environments. It provides facilities to allow web sites to authenticate their web user clients using a number of (HTTP) authentication schemes. In addition, it supports user authorization using dedicated service identifiers. Diameter WebAuth may also be used by non web-based Diameter clients and servers that require a lightweight authentication and authorization Diameter application.</t>
