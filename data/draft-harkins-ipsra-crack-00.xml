      <t>This memo describes a new IKE authentication method ([HC98]) whichprovides for mutual authentication when one side is using a legacy-based secret-key authentication technique such as RADIUS, SecurID, orOTP and the other side is using public-key authentication, withoptional digital certificates.The generic protocol described herein is an open-ended IKE phase 1exchange ([HC98]). The result of this exchange is a mutuallyauthenticated IKE security association ([HC98]). The keys that arederived from this SA are also authenticated and thereby convey thisstate to any SA's created from it for any other security service,such as IPsec [Pip98].</t>
