      <t>This memo describes a new IKE authentication method ([HC98]) which provides for mutual authentication when one side is using a legacy- based secret-key authentication technique such as RADIUS, SecurID, or OTP and the other side is using public-key authentication, with optional digital certificates. The generic protocol described herein is an open-ended IKE phase 1 exchange ([HC98]). The result of this exchange is a mutually authenticated IKE security association ([HC98]). The keys that are derived from this SA are also authenticated and thereby convey this state to any SA's created from it for any other security service, such as IPsec [Pip98].</t>
