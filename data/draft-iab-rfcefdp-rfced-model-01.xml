      <t>This document describes Version 3 of the RFC Editor model. As specified here, the model divides the responsibilities for the RFC Series into two high-level functions: policy definition governing the Series as a whole, and policy implementation through publication of documents in the Series. The policy definition function is the responsibility of the RFC Series Working Group (RSWG), which produces policy proposals that are subject to approval by the RFC Series Approval Board (RSAB). The policy implementation function is primarily the responsibility of the RFC Production Center (RPC), under the ultimate authority of the IETF Administration Limited Liability Company (LLC). This document reflects experience gained with version 1 of the RFC Editor Model as specified in RFC 5620 and with version 2 as specified in RFC 6635 and RFC 8728. This document obsoletes RFC 8728.</t>
