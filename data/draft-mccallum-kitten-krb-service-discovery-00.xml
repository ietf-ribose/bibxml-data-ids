      <t>This document proposes defines a new mechanism for discovering Kerberos services using DNS. This new mechanism extends the mechanism already defined in Kerberos V5 [RFC4120] and has four goals. First, reduce the number of DNS queries required to discover a Kerberos KDC. Second, provide DNS administrators more control over client behavior. Third, provide support for discovery of the MS- KKDCP transport. Fourth, define a discovery procedure for Kerberos password services.</t>
