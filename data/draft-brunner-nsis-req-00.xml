      <t>This draft proposes a set of requirements for signaling QoS acrossdifferent network environments. To achieve wide applicability of therequirements, the starting point is a diverse set of user scenariosconcerning both access and core networks, application interactions,and use within cellular networks. We also provide an outlinestructure for the problem, including QoS related terminology.</t>
