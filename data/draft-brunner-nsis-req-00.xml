      <t>This draft proposes a set of requirements for signaling QoS across different network environments. To achieve wide applicability of the requirements, the starting point is a diverse set of user scenarios concerning both access and core networks, application interactions, and use within cellular networks. We also provide an outline structure for the problem, including QoS related terminology.</t>
