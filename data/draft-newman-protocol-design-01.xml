      <t>There are a number of design principles which come into play over and over again when designing application protocols. Many of these are entrenched in IETF lore and spread by word of mouth. Most have been learned the hard way many times. This is an attempt to codify some of these principles so they can be referenced rather than spread by word of mouth. The author has not invented any of these ideas and while the exercise of finding the originator of the ideas would be interesting, it is not deemed necessary for this project. Many of these principles have a much wider scope than application protocol design. However, the author's primary experience is with application protocols and examples provided usually involve application protocols or elements. [Disclaimer: this is a preliminary draft. Some of the case studies and exceptions need tuning. Suggestions welcome.]</t>
