      <t>This document describes the problem statement, use cases, and requirements for a "Distributed Inference Network" (DIN) in the era of pervasive AI. As AI inference services become widely deployed and accessed by billions of users, applications and devices, traditional centralized cloud-based inference architectures face challenges in scalability, latency, security, and efficiency. DIN aims to address these challenges by leveraging distributed edge-cloud collaboration, intelligent scheduling, and enhanced network security to support low- latency, high-concurrency, and secure AI inference services.</t>
