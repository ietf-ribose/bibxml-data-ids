      <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) provides path computationfunctions in support of traffic engineering in Multiprotocol LabelSwitching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks.An important application of MPLS and GMPLS networks is VirtualPrivate Networks (VPNs) that may be constructed using Label SwitchedPaths (LSPs) in the MPLS and GMPLS networks as VPN tunnels. PCE maybe applied as a tool to compute the paths of such tunnels in order toachieve better use of the network resources and to provide betterlevels of service to the VPN customers.Generic requirements for a communication protocol between PathComputation Clients (PCCs) and PCEs are presented in "PathComputation Element (PCE) Communication Protocol GenericRequirements". This document complements the generic requirements andpresents a detailed set of PCC-PCE communication protocolrequirements that are specific to the application of PCE to VPNs.</t>
