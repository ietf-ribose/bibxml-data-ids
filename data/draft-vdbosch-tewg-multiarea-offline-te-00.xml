      <t>This document describes an approach to engineer a hierarchical network by means of offline traffic engineering. This approach can be used as a stand-alone solution, as was recently described as an example of a best current practice, or it may be combined with online traffic engineering. The offline approach presented here uses global information about network topology and traffic matrix to optimize explicit routes in the network. The optimization is based on the definition of global network performance parameters.</t>
