    <abstract>
      <t>The term 'service-based routing' (SBR) captures the set of mechanisms for the steering of traffic in an application-level service scenario. As in the related use case and gap analysis drafts, we position this steering as an anycast problem, requiring the selection of one of the possibly many choices for service execution at the very start of a service transaction. This document outlines a possible architecture for realizing SBR so as to address the issues identified in the use case and gap analysis companion documents, specifically aiming at the realization of the requirements in the latter document. We outline the architecture, with pointers to possible realizations of the interactions, while also outlining possible extensions to a base SBR capability through a ROSA system as an outlook to possible richer capabilities.</t>
