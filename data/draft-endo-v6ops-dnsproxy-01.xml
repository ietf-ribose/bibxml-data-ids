    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the DNS Proxy that is separated from NAT-PT [RFC2766]. NAT-PT was designed to work with DNS Application Level Gateway. However [RFC4966] pointed out DNS related issues, and [RFC2766] was changed to historical state. This document attempts to DNS Proxy specification, removing dependency on NAT-PT as well as resolving problems pointed in [RFC4966].</t>
