      <t>The multicast operation of the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector(AODV) routing protocol (MAODV) is intended for use by mobile nodesin an ad hoc network. It offers quick adaptation to dynamic linkconditions, low processing and memory overhead, and low networkutilization. It creates bi-directional shared multicast treesconnecting multicast sources and receivers. These multicast treesare maintained as long as group members exist within the connectedportion of the network. Each multicast group has a group leaderwhose responsibility is maintaining the group sequence number, whichis used to ensure freshness of routing information.</t>
