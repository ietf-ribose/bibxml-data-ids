      <t>This memo proposes extensions to the DNS protocols to provide for an incremental zone transfer (IXFR) procedure. A companion mechanism, the NOTIFY procedure, is also proposed to allow secondaries to learn of changes to the primary database in a timely manner. A new DNS Opcode (NEWQUERY) is proposed that will provide the necessary upgrades to the DNS packet structure to provide for both these mechanisms. Further, it allows for easy upgradability, in the future. Two new RR types (CARRIER and ISOA) are proposed. This memo provides only a first cut at an attempt to document the ideas about these protocols and we invite extensive comments, maybe to revamp the entire stream of thought.</t>
