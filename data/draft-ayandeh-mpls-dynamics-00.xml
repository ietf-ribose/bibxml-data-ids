    <abstract>
      <t>This Internet draft outlines how transients in protocols such as OSPF [7] (intra-domain routing) and MPLS LDP [2] can lead to periods of time with loops and other undesirable routing phenomenon. It defines a set of metrics to quantify this dynamic behavior. Quantification of these metrics, using a simulation model, for various local vs. egress label allocation schemes is used as the basis of a comparative analysis. This includes quantifying any incremental impact that MPLS may have once it is introduced into an autonomous IP routing area. The resulting insights would help develop a better understanding of routing dynamics. This includes identifying key nodal and network variables which impact routing dynamics hence guiding MPLS feature selection and IP network design.</t>
