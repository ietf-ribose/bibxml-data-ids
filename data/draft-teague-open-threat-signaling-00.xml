      <t>This document defines a method by which a device or application maysignal information relating to current threat handling to otherdevices/applications that may reside locally or in the cloud. Theinitial focus is ddos mitigation; however, the method may be extendedto communicate any threat type. This will allow for a vendor orprovider agnostic approach to threat mitigation utilising multiplelayers of protection as the operator sees fit.The dissemination of threat information will occur utilising JSON RPCAPI over HTTPS communications between devices/applications and will beaugmented by IPFIX and UDP for signaling telemetry informationrelating to attacks and protected object data.An open standards based approach to communication between on-premiseDDoS mitigation devices and cloud based DDoS protection servicesallows for enterprises to have a wider range of options to bettersecure their environments without the limitations of vendor lock-in.</t>
