      <t>It is a common practice for multiple interface terminals to use a connection manager to perform provisioning domain selection and interface configuration. The concept of connection managers for personal computers is well known, and similar logic is now common in mobile phones that have multiple radio interfaces [3GPP TS 23.402]. The Problem Statement document highlights the lack of standardized behavior for terminals in regard to managing multiple interfaces and their respective properties. To address this issue, this document proposes a set of functional requirements for a generic MIF Connection Manager.</t>
