    <abstract>
      <t>As more and more modern network applications grow in scale and complexity, their demands and requirements on the supporting communication network will increase. In particular, these demands require the use of specific network management and traffic policies which currently are not provided directly by the communication network to these applications. Application demands that are similar in nature can be grouped together in grouped/classified application models. This draft specifies the need for application policy on network functions (APONF) APONF protocol(s), mechanisms and models required by transport applications to easily, accurately, and efficiently select and use the available communication network capabilities, i.e., network management and/or traffic policies.</t>
