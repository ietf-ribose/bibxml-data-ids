      <t>This document defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) eventpackage for registrations. Through its REGISTER method, SIP allows auser agent to create, modify, and delete registrations. Registrationscan also be altered by administrators in order to enforce policy.These registrations therefore represent a piece of state in thenetwork that can change dynamically. There are many cases where auser agent would like to be notified of changes in this state. Thisevent package defines a mechanism by which those user agents canrequest and obtain such notifications</t>
