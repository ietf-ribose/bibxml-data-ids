      <t>Many Internet services need asynchronous notifications. At the sametime there is an increasing number of protocols which use HTTP orHTTP-alike request-response transactions.This document proposes an extension to application protocols whichenables asynchronous notifications from server to client throughclient initiated request-response transactions. The extension appliesthe Unix select() pattern to TCP connections of HTTP-alike protocols.Hence it is called HTTP-SELECT.</t>
