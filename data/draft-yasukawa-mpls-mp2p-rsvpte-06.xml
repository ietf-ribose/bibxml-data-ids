      <t>Traffic engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE) uses Resource Reservation Protocol traffic engineering extensions (RSVP-TE) as the signaling protocol to establish Label Switched Paths (LSPs). Although the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) on which RSVP-TE is built supports the convergence of traffic flows toward a common destination, this concept has not been exploited in MPLS-TE which has been limited to point-to-point (P2P) and point-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs. This document describes extensions to RSVP-TE procedures and protocol elements to support multipoint-to-point (MP2P) LSPs.</t>
