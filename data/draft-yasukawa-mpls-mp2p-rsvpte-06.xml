      <t>Traffic engineered Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS-TE) usesResource Reservation Protocol traffic engineering extensions(RSVP-TE) as the signaling protocol to establish Label Switched Paths(LSPs). Although the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) on whichRSVP-TE is built supports the convergence of traffic flows toward acommon destination, this concept has not been exploited in MPLS-TEwhich has been limited to point-to-point (P2P) andpoint-to-multipoint (P2MP) LSPs.This document describes extensions to RSVP-TE procedures and protocolelements to support multipoint-to-point (MP2P) LSPs.</t>
