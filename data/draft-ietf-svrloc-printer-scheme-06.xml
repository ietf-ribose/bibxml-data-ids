    <abstract>
      <t>This document is a product of the Service Location and Internet Printing Protocol Working Groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). Comments should be sent to the srvloc@srvloc.org and ipp@pwg.org mailing lists. This document defines the 'service:printer:' abstract type and the attributes associated with it. This 'service:printer:' template is designed to be used in conjunction with the Service Location Protocol, Version 2 (SLPv2) [13], but may be used with any directory service which supports attribute/value pair registration, such as the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, Version 3 (LDAPv3 [16]). The 'service:printer:' type is specified as an abstract service type. Printers advertised with the 'service:printer:' abstract type may be accessible by one or more print protocols, such as IPP [3] and LPR [2].</t>
