      <t>Recommendations for Interoperable Networks using Intermediate Systemto Intermediate System (IS-IS) [RFC3719] highlights a number ofdifferences between the IS-IS protocol as described in ISO 10589 andthe protocol as it is deployed today.This document outlines a number of differences found in the ChinaMobile backbone network, which is constructed using routers fromseveral manufacturers. These differences include LSP checksumcalculation, zero checksum LSP processing, zero remaining lifetimeLSP processing, and corrupt LSP processing. This document isintended to provide best current practices to facilitateinteroperability and maintain network stability.</t>
