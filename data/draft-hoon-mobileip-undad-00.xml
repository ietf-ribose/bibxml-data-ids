      <t>The Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) procedure detailed by Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) requires nodes to wait for a quantified time interval during which the configured address is checked for duplication in the connected link. This delay affects normal communication in a Mobile Node (MN) during the DAD time interval thereby hampering Fast Handoff. The expected use of Mobile IP on a wide scale and the need for a minimal time delay during the handoff process require alternate mechanisms for overcoming the DAD time interval. This draft presents a mechanism wherein the Access Router's (AR) Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) is used to minimize the delay associated with the DAD procedure.</t>
