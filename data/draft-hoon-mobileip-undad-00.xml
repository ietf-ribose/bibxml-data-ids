      <t>The Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) procedure detailed by NeighborDiscovery Protocol (NDP) requires nodes to wait for a quantified timeinterval during which the configured address is checked forduplication in the connected link. This delay affects normalcommunication in a Mobile Node (MN) during the DAD time intervalthereby hampering Fast Handoff. The expected use of Mobile IP on awide scale and the need for a minimal time delay during the handoffprocess require alternate mechanisms for overcoming the DAD timeinterval. This draft presents a mechanism wherein the Access Router's(AR) Neighbor Cache Entry (NCE) is used to minimize the delayassociated with the DAD procedure.</t>
