      <t>Networks which are using IPv4 addresses are using the addresstranslation technologies such as NAT at end-networks for variousreasons. However, those technologies sometimes prevent two-waytransparently communications.This document will define a way to enhance address translationtechnologies such as NAT. This way will be able to communicatetransparently by adding a sub-address to IPv4.This enhancement will be called 'NATS'(Network Address Translationwith Sub-Address) in this document.</t>
