      <t>Networks which are using IPv4 addresses are using the address translation technologies such as NAT at end-networks for various reasons. However, those technologies sometimes prevent two-way transparently communications. This document will define a way to enhance address translation technologies such as NAT. This way will be able to communicate transparently by adding a sub-address to IPv4. This enhancement will be called 'NATS'(Network Address Translation with Sub-Address) in this document.</t>
