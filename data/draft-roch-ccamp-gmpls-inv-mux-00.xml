      <t>A set of requirements and a proposed implementation for the controlof the SONET/SDH inverse multiplexing capabilities known as VCAT/LCASis given in [CCAMP-VCAT]. However, implementations based on OIFimplementation agreements and their prototype extensions haveidentified gaps in [CCAMP-VCAT]. This draft proposes a wider scopedalternative implementation approach that addresses the requirementsof [CCAMP-VCAT] and additional requirements of independent setup ofthe VCAT group and its members.</t>
