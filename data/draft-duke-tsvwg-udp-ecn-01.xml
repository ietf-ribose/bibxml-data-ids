      <t>Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) applies to all transport protocols in principle. However, it had limited applications for UDP until QUIC became widely deployed. As a result, documentation of UDP socket APIs for ECN on various platforms is sparse. This document records the results of experimenting with these APIs in order to get ECN working on UDP for Chromium on Apple, Linux, and Windows platforms.</t>
