      <t>The IETF has developed security technologies that help to secure the Internet of Things even over constrained networks and when targetting constrained nodes. These technologies can be used independenly or can be composed into larger systems to mitigate a variety of threats. This documents illustrates an overview over these technologies and highlights their relationships. Ultimately, a threat model is presented as a basis to derive requirements that interconnect existing and emerging solution technologies.</t>
