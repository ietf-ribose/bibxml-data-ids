      <t>This document defines a set of metrics for high-precision networking services. These metrics can be used to assess the service levels that are being delivered for a networking flow. Specifically, they can be used to determine the degree of compliance with which service levels are being delivered relative to service level objectives that were defined for the flow. The metrics can be used as part of flow records and/or accounting records. They can also be used to continuously monitor the quality with which high-precision networking service are being delivered.</t>
