      <t>This document provides a framework that describes a solution spacefor the control and management of optical interfaces according to theBlack Link approach as specified by ITU-T [ITU.G698.2] and beyond(friendly wavelength). In particular, it examines topologicalelements and related network management measures.Optical Routing and Wavelength assignment based on WSON is out ofscope. This document concentrates on the management of opticalinterfaces. The application of a dynamic control plane, e.g. forauto-discovery or for the distribtion of interface parameters, iscomplementary. Anyway, this work is not in conflict with WSON butleverages and supports related work already done for management planeand control plane.Furthermore, support for Fast Fault Detection, to e.g. triggerProtection Switching is provided by the WDM interface capability ofthe client interface (e.g. ITU-T G.709) is out of scope for thiswork. Additionally the wavelength ordering process and the processhow to determine the demand for a new wavelength from A to Z is outof scope.</t>
