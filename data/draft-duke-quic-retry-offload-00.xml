    <abstract>
      <t>QUIC uses Retry packets to reduce load on stressed servers, by forcing the client to prove ownership of its address before the server commits state. QUIC also has an anti-tampering mechanism to prevent the unauthorized injection of Retry packets into a connection. However, a server operator may want to offload production of Retry packets to an anti-Denial-of-Service agent or hardware accelerator. "Retry Offload" is a mechanism for coordination between a server and an external generator of Retry packets that can succeed despite the anti-tampering mechanism.</t>
