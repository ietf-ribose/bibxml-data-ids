    <abstract>
      <t>The MPLS protocol specifications provide a large number of options, and it can be difficult to know exactly which protocol messages, objects, and procedures must be supported in order to provide some particular application of MPLS, or in order to interoperate with some other implementation. This document specifies a number of MPLS 'Profiles'. Each Profile is a subset of the full MPLS functionality, specified in enough detail to ensure that two implementations of a given Profile will interoperate. This document also specifies which Profiles may be used for which purposes. In the future, it is hoped that specifications for the applications of MPLS will specify the Profiles that must be implemented in order to support the application.</t>
