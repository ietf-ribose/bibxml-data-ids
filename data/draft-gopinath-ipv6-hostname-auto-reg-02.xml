      <t>This document describes a new method, which will automatically acquire the host name of active IPv6 nodes and register it to the local Domain Name System (DNS) server. Active IPv6 nodes are nodes that are connected to a network. Our proposed new method [6] will automatically learn some useful information from all the IPv6 nodes, such as the host name and the IP address. The Agent using a new method will keep all the information that is send by the nodes. The Resolver will add the host name together with the IPv6 address to the DNS. This will be implemented without the need for any changes at the clients' site. The objective of this document is to specify a new procedure and also the algorithm used in the procedure.</t>
