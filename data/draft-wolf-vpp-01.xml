      <t>The purpose of the Virtual Presence Protocol (VPP) protocol is to enable the exchange of document based virtual presence information. Virtual presence information is the foundation for virtual neighborhood services which provide users with information about virtual neighbors, i.e. other users who are close within the virtual document space. VPP enables the creation of dynamic vicinities based on hypertext references. It is not meant to replace or supersede presence notification protocols, but it augments online presence with location information. The protocol described in this document is based on 2 years of experience with location based virtual presence and presence notification. The purpose of presence notification protocols such as the drafted [RVP] is to tell whether another individual is online or arrives online, etc. As opposed to such real online presence, the presence on documents in the World Wide Web is a virtual one. The authors recognize that VPP shares methods, mechanisms, and formats with HTTP, and drafted presence notification protocols (e.g. RVP, IMPP), however the functionality is significantly different. Changes since draft-wolf-vpp-00.txt: Added event types, IANA assigned port 677, extended service URL lookup to simplify VPP hosting, added SELECT update method, adapted to latest XML name space spec, maxdata and more-tag.</t>
