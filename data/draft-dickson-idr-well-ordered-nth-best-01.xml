      <t>This Internet Draft describes an enhanced way to exchange prefixinformation, so as to permit multiple copies of a prefix, withdifferent paths, to be announced and withdrawn.This negotiated capability facilitates faster local (inter-AS) andglobal (intra-AS) convergence, reduces path-hunting, improves route-reflector behaviour, including eliminating persistent oscillations.Additional prefix instances have a new wire format for updates andwithdrawals, to control path selection.Benefits are seen both when deployed intra-AS, and on inter-ASpeering.Author's NoteThis Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft or a relateddraft(s) being placed on the Standards Track for idr.The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in thisdocument are to be interpreted as described in [5].</t>
