      <t>This Internet Draft describes an enhanced way to exchange prefix information, so as to permit multiple copies of a prefix, with different paths, to be announced and withdrawn. This negotiated capability facilitates faster local (inter-AS) and global (intra-AS) convergence, reduces path-hunting, improves route- reflector behaviour, including eliminating persistent oscillations. Additional prefix instances have a new wire format for updates and withdrawals, to control path selection. Benefits are seen both when deployed intra-AS, and on inter-AS peering. Author's Note This Internet Draft is intended to result in this draft or a related draft(s) being placed on the Standards Track for idr. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [5].</t>
