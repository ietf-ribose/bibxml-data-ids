      <t>This document proposes an extension to the Session Initiation Protocol, RFC-2543[3]. The extension adds the PROPOSE method to the SIP protocol. The intend of the PROPOSE method is to allow a Media Gateway or other types of server that is serving a SIP node in a live session to propose a revised session setting to the node due to changes in network or other constraints of the current session. An example of revised session setting could be a suggestion to the node to lower its quality of service or choose a lower bandwidth codec due to an increase in network traffic.</t>
