      <t>As internet traffic is increasingly sourced-from and destined-to wireless endpoints, it is crucial that Quality of Service be aligned between wired and wireless networks; however, this is not always the case by default. This document specifies a set Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) to IEEE 802.11 User Priority (UP) mappings to reconcile the marking recommendations offered by the IETF and the IEEE so as to maintain consistent QoS treatment between wired and IEEE 802.11 wireless networks.</t>
