      <t>This document considers the problem of service identification in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). Service identification is the process of determining the user-level use case that is driving the signaling being utilized by the user agent. While seemingly simple, this process is quite complex, and when not addressed properly, can lead to fraud, interoperability problems, and stifling of innovation. This document discusses these problems and makes recommendations on how to address them.</t>
