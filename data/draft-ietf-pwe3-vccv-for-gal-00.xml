      <t>This document describes a unified mode of operation for Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV), which provides a control channel that is associated with a pseudowire (PW). VCCV applies to all supported access circuit and transport types currently defined for PWs, as well as those being transported by The MPLS Transport Profile. This new mode is intended to augment those described in RFC5085, but this document describes new rules requiring this mode to be used as the default/mandatory mode of operation for VCCV. The older types will remain optional.</t>
