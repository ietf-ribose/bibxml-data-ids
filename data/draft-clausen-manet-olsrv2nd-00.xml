      <t>This document describes the neighborhood discovery protocol for theOptimized Link State Routing Protocol version 2. The protocolprovides each node with local topology up to two hops distance,describing a node's 1-hop neighbors and symmetric 2-hop neighbors.This is achieved through periodic message exchange. The neighborhooddiscovery protocol may be used by other MANET protocols which needneighborhood information.The protocol imposes minimum requirements to the network by notrequiring sequenced or reliable transmission of control traffic.</t>
