    <abstract>
      <t>Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) represents a paradigm shift in wireless networks, where sensing and communication functions are jointly designed and optimized. By leveraging the same spectral and hardware resources, ISAC enables advanced capabilities such as environment perception, object tracking, and situational awareness, while maintaining efficient and reliable data transmission. This integration holds great potential for applications in areas such as autonomous systems, smart cities, and industrial automation, where precise sensing and low-latency communication are critical. This document presents a use case related to ISAC, aiming to facilitate discussions within the CATS Working Group on the potential challenges, and requirements. The aim for this document is to facilitate discussion in the CATS WG for potential consideration of the use case.</t>
