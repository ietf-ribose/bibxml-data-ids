The OSPF protocol is specified in [2], This extension make use of opaque LSA defined in [3] and provides similar information to what is defined in the ISIS extensions for traffic engineering[4]. This document extends the OSPF protocol by specifying new information that a router can place in a type 10 opaque Link State Advertisement (LSA).
