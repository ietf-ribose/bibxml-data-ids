    <abstract>
      <t>Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP) messages will be carried as Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents. As such, the goal of mapping to the transport layer is to ensure that the underlying XML documents are carried successfully between the various parties. This document describes that mapping for the Hyper Text Transport Protocol (HTTP), Versions 1.0 and 1.1, and the location of HTTP based IOTP services using the SRV domain name system resource record.</t>
