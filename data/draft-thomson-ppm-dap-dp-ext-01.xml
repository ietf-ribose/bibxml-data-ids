    <abstract>
      <t>The Distributed Aggregation Protocol (DAP) can be a key component of a system that provides differentially-private guarantees for participants. Extensions to DAP are defined to support these guarantees. This includes bindings of reports to specific options, so that the aggregation service can better implement privacy budgeting and replay protections.</t>
