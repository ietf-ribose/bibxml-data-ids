      <t>This document describes mapping the RTP payload type to the port number of transport layer. The purpose of this mapping is to let UDP header information distinguish the payload type of a RTP packet. Packet classification using the UDP header information is a widely accepted method of applying QoS to the Internet traffic. The proposed method in this document does not require any changes of UDP packet format. Any method of classifying packets is outside the scope of this specification.</t>
