      <t>This document describes an address resolution process tailored to work under NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP)[1] over Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network with mixture of PVC environment and SVC environment. Now consider the case where NHRP clients, each are connected to PVC network, try to communicate each other through SVC network existing on the path between the PVC networks of each client.</t>
