      <t>This document describes the benefits and main applications of sending explicit fast notification (FN) packets to routers in an area. FN packets are generated and processed in the dataplane, and a single FN service can substitute existing OAM methods for remote failure detection, such as a full mesh of multi-hop BFD session. The FN service, therefore, decreases network overhead considerable. The main application is fast reroute in pure IP and in IP/LDP-MPLS networks called IPFRR-FN. The detour paths used when IPFRR-FN is active are in most cases identical to those used after Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) convergence. The proposed mechanism can address all single link, node, and SRLG failures in an area; moreover it is an efficient solution to protect against BGP ASBR failures as well as VPN PE router failures. IPFRR-FN can be a supplemental tool to provide FRR when LFA cannot repair a failure case, while it can be a replacement of existing ASBR/PE protection mechanisms by overcoming their scalability and complexity issues.</t>
