      <t>The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) is a profile of the Real-time Transport Protocol that can provide confidentiality, message authentication, and replay protection to the RTP traffic and to the control traffic for RTP, the Real-time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP). This document describes a method of using DTLS key management for SRTP by using a new extension that indicates that SRTP is to be used for data protection, and which establishes SRTP keys.</t>
