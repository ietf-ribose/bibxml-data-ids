      <t>The NBMA Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP) [NHRP] specifies a mechanism that allows a station (e.g., a host or a router) on an NBMA subnetwork to find the NBMA subnetwork address of a destination station when the destination station is connected to the NBMA subnetwork. For the case where the destination station is off the NBMA subnetwork the mechanism described in [NHRP] allows to determine the NBMA subnetwork address of an egress router from the NBMA subnetwork that is ``nearest'' to the destination station. However, [NHRP] constrains the ability of determining the egress router to the destinations that are directly connected to the egress router. This document describes extensions to the NHRP that allow a station to acquire and maintain the information about the egress router without constraining the destination(s) to be directly connected to the egress router.</t>
