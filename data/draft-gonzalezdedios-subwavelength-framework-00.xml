      <t>This document discusses the framework for enhancements to the GMPLSarchitecture to control sub-wavelength switching optical networks.Sub-wavelengths refer to the time-shared utilization of a singlewavelength by optical bursts, packets or slots.Sub-wavelngth technologies are the base of new cost-effective networkarchitectures. In particular, they are sutited for metro areas, tocope with high traffic volumens as well as more demandingrequirements of networked applications.</t>
