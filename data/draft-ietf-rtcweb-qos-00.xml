      <t>Many networks, such as Service Provider and Enterprise networks, can provide per packet treatments based on Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCP) on a per hop basis. This document defines the recommended DSCP values for browsers to use for various classes of traffic. This draft is a very early and far from done. It is meant to provide the structure for the idea of how to do this but much discussion is needed about the details.</t>
