    <abstract>
      <t>Network administrators typically enforce Quality of Service (QoS) policies according to Service Level Agreement (SLA) with their providers. The enforcement of such policies often relies upon vendor-specific configuration language. Both learning of SLA, either thru SLA documents or via some other out-of-band method, and translating them to vendor specific configuration language is a complex, many times manual, process and prone to errors. This document proposes an in-band method of SLA signaling which can help to simplify some of the complexities. This document defines an optional transitive attribute to signal SLA details in-band, across administrative boundaries (considered as Autonomous Systems (AS)), thus simplifying and facilitating some of the complex provisioning tasks. Though the use case with the proposed BGP attribute is explicitly defined in this document, purpose of this attribute is not limited to this use case only.</t>
