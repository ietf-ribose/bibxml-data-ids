      <t>This document describes the Waypoint path oriented delivery mechanism. Waypoint attempts to rationalize the packet interception problem that has been addressed by different mechanisms such as router alert or RSVP protocol number 46 intercept. It borrows concepts from prior mechanisms, including the hop by hop security model of RSVP. Waypoint strives to be complete, eliminating the need to reimplement common functionality in the higher layers of the signaling protocol stack.</t>
