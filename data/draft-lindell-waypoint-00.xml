      <t>This document describes the Waypoint path oriented deliverymechanism. Waypoint attempts to rationalize the packetinterception problem that has been addressed by differentmechanisms such as router alert or RSVP protocol number 46intercept. It borrows concepts from prior mechanisms,including the hop by hop security model of RSVP. Waypointstrives to be complete, eliminating the need to reimplementcommon functionality in the higher layers of the signalingprotocol stack.</t>
