      <t>This document aims at establishing a common understanding about potential experimental setups where different information-centric networking (ICN) approaches can be tested and compared against each other while showcasing their advantages. Towards this end, we review the ICN literature and document scenarios which have been considered in previous performance evaluation studies. The scenarios presented aim to exercise a variety of aspects that an ICN solution can address. On the one hand, we consider general aspects, such as, network efficiency, reduced complexity, increased scalability and reliability, mobility support, multicast and caching performance, real-time communication efficacy, energy consumption frugality, and disruption and delay tolerance. On the other hand, we focus on ICN- specific aspects, such as information security and trust, persistence, availability, provenance, and location independence.</t>
