      <t>RFC 2132 defines the DHCP for IPv4 options 1 to 127 as the DHCPpublic option space which is managed by IANA as documented in RFC2939. As this public option space has few unassigned options at thistime, it is prudent to define a mechanism to extend this option spacebefore it is too late. This Internet-Draft proposes two means toextend this option space.</t>
