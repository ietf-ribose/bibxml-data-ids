      <t>This memo specifies modifications required to DS-Lite and 6RD so thatboth IPv4/ IPv6 hosts can receive multicast data from IPv4/ IPv6servers.The DS-Lite solution is based on DS-Lite Basic Bridging BroadBandelement (B4) proxying IGMP and then tunneling IGMP messages to DS-Lite Address Family Transition Router element (AFTR). IPv4 multicastdata received at AFTR is tunneled to B$ and then delivered to thehosts. IPv6 multicast and MLD can be supported in a similar way.The 6RD protocol is based on proxying MLD at the 6RD Customer Edgeand then tunneling MLD messages to 6RD Border Relays where IPv6multicast routing is supported. Multicast data received at 6RDBorder Relay is tunneled to 6RD Customer Edge node and then deliveredto the hosts. We show that IPv4 multicast and IGMP can be supportedin a similar way.</t>
