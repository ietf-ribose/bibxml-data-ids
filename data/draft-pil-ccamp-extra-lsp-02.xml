      <t>This document provides the problem statement on a extra class LSP ser-vice and addresses the issues. The extra class LSP uses the resourcereserved but not allocated for the protecting LSPs in the pre-plannedLSP re-routing without extra-traffic (including shared mesh) recoverymethod. Network utilization is improved because the resource reservedfor the protecting LSPs are used for the extra class LSPs. The extraclass LSP is preempted less frequently than the conventional prioritymechanism using setup and holding priorities because the resourcereserved for the protecting LSPs is allocated only if the working LSPfails, which is usually expected to rarely occur. This document pro-poses the extra class LSP service using the resource reserved but notallocated for the protecting LSP at the provisioning phase. This docu-ment addresses the issues on the extra class LSP: (1) advertisement ofavailable resource, (2) extra class LSP indication in signaling message(3) extra class LSP preemption signaling, and (4) preventing unintendedconnections.</t>
