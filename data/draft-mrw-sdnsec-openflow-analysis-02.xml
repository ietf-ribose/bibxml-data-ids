      <t>This document discusses the security properties of the OpenFlow Switch Specification version 1.3.0 (OpenFlow), a Software-Defined Network (SDN) solution produced by the Open Networking Foundation (ONF). It analyzes the suitability of OpenFlow for use in "the cloud" or on the open Internet. It also makes some suggestions about how OpenFlow could be made more secure for use in those environments.</t>
