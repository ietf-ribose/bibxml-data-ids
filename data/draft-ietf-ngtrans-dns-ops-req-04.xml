      <t>This document describes IPv6 DNS operational requirements and deployment roadmap. It is the result of discussion from members of the IPv6, NGtrans, DNSops and DNSext working groups. The DNS is looked as a critical part of the Internet infrastructure and is used for much more purposes than name to address resolution. Thus a smooth operation of the DNS is critical in the IPv6 transition.</t>
