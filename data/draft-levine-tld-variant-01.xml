      <t>IDNA [RFC5890] provides a method to map a subset of names written in Unicode into the DNS. Some languages allow a particular name to be written in multiple ways that are represented differently in IDNA, known as "variants". This document surveys the approaches that ICANN-contracted top level domains have taken to the registration and provisioning of variant names. This document is not (and will not be) a product of the IETF, and does not (and will not) propose any method to make variants work "correctly".</t>
