      <t>Most distributed (client/server) applications require an authenti- cation process between the client and the server before the server will grant access to its managed resources. Many applications pro- vide varying levels of access to server resources based on a combi- nation of authentication credentials and access control rules. The collection of information used to control access to resources is called 'authorization information'. The authorization identifer datasets contain lists of users and groups of users that can be used by applications for authorization purposes. Access control mechanisms can be abstracted from under- lying authentication mechanisms and credential formats. They can be extended to include group memberships in dynamic calculations for access rights to resources or in definition of one time autho- rization certificates. The Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) supports the remote storage and access of many types of structured configuration information. The authorization identifier datasets specification describes the 'userid' and 'groupid' datasets which contain the authorization information. It also describes ACAP server capabili- ties that advertise a server's support for authorization user and group semantics.</t>
