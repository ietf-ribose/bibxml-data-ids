      <t>Most distributed (client/server) applications require an authenti-cation process between the client and the server before the serverwill grant access to its managed resources. Many applications pro-vide varying levels of access to server resources based on a combi-nation of authentication credentials and access control rules.The collection of information used to control access to resourcesis called 'authorization information'.The authorization identifer datasets contain lists of users andgroups of users that can be used by applications for authorizationpurposes. Access control mechanisms can be abstracted from under-lying authentication mechanisms and credential formats. They canbe extended to include group memberships in dynamic calculationsfor access rights to resources or in definition of one time autho-rization certificates.The Application Configuration Access Protocol (ACAP) supports theremote storage and access of many types of structured configurationinformation. The authorization identifier datasets specificationdescribes the 'userid' and 'groupid' datasets which contain theauthorization information. It also describes ACAP server capabili-ties that advertise a server's support for authorization user andgroup semantics.</t>
