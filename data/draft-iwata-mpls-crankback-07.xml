      <t>In a distributed, constraint-based routing environment, theinformation used to compute a path may be out of date. This meansthat Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) label switched path (LSP)setup requests may be blocked by links or nodes without sufficientresources. Crankback is a scheme whereby setup failure information isreturned from the point of failure to allow new setup attempts to bemade avoiding the blocked resources. Crankback can also be applied toLSP restoration to indicate the location of the failed link or node.This document specifies crankback signaling extensions for use inMPLS signaling using RSVP-TE as defined in 'RSVP-TE: Extensions toRSVP for LSP Tunnels', RFC3209, so that the LSP setup request can beretried on an alternate path that detours around blocked links ornodes. This offers significant improvements in the successful setupand recovery ratios for LSPs, especially in situations where a largenumber of setup requests are triggered at the same time.</t>
