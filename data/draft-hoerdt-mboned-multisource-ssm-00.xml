    <abstract>
      <t>Classical multicast multi-sources applications use the Deering's [1] ASM group communication model where anyone, including non-members, can send packets with one local operation to a group identifier G with best effort guarantees that its packet will be transmitted to all group members: the network duplicates packets and manages the dynamics of source and receivers. With the new Holbrook's [3] SSM model it is the responsibility of applications to tell the network who are their sources of interest. As a consequence, the SSM model is well suited for TV-like (one to many) applications because there is only one source to discover and it's supposed to be well known. But there is still missing an SSM session layer or middleware for applications helping multi-sources applications to discover the presence/leaving source in case of SSM model. We give here a possible implementation for this Source discovery session layer according to the protocol defined in [5].</t>
