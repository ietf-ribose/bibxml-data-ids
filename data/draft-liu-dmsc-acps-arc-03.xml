      <t>Internet of Agents (IoA) aims to facilitate interconnection and collaboration among heterogeneous agents to address complex tasks and support diverse applications. This IETF draft proposes the Agent Collaboration Protocols (ACPs) architecture, which includes conceptual domains, functional components and reference interfaces, to achieve agent interconnection and collaboration. ACPs cover all stages of agents in the network, from their access to collaboration, supporting agent trusted registration, agent identity authentication, agent discovery, agent interaction, tool invocation, and agent monitoring. The long-term vision of ACPs is to support the future large-scale interconnected agents and construct the key infrastructure for IoA.</t>
