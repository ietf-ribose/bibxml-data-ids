      <t>Handling multiple sets of network trouble tickets (TTs) originating from different participants' inter-connected network environments poses a series of challenges for the involved institutions. A Grid is a good example of such a multi-domain project. Each of the participants follows different procedures for handling trouble in its domain, according to the local technical and linguistic profile. The TT systems of the participants collect, represent, and disseminate TT information in different formats. As a result, management of the daily workload by a central Network Operation Centre (NOC) is a challenge on its own. Normalization of TTs to a common format at the central NOC can ease presentation, storing, and handling of the TTs. In the present document, we provide a model for automating the collection and normalization of the TT received by multiple networks forming the Grid. Each of the participants is using its home TT system within its domain for handling trouble incidents, whereas the central NOC is gathering the tickets in the normalized format for repository and handling. XML is used as the common representation language. The model was defined and used as part of the networking support activity of the EGEE (Enabling Grids for E-sciencE) project. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>
