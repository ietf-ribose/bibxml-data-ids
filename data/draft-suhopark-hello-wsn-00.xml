      <t>In this document, We consider Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) security andfocus our attention to tolerate damage caused by an adversary who has compromised deployed sensor node to modify, block, or inject packets. We adopt a probabilistic secret sharing protocol where secrets shared between two sensor nodes are not exposed to any other nodes. Adapting to WSN characteristics, we incorporate these secrets with bidirectional verification and multipath routing to multiple base stations to defend against HELLO flood attacks. We then analytically show that our defensemechanisms against HELLO flood attack can tolerate damage caused by an intruder</t>
