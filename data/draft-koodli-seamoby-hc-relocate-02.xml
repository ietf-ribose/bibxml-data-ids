      <t>In networks with bandwidth constraints, such as wireless cellular networks, compression of IP and transport headers may be employed to obtain better utilization of the available spectrum capacity. When header compression is used along with handovers in such networks, the header compression context needs to be relocated from one IP access point (i.e., a router) to another in order to achieve seamless operation. In this document, we propose a mechanism to achieve this compression context relocation using options for the handover ICMP messages defined for IPv6 and suboptions for the destination options used by mobile nodes to request smooth handovers.</t>
