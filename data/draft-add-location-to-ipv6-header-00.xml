      <t>This document describes IP-LOC, a proposed extension which suggestsadding GPS coordinates to IPv6 header. The current method of determining location of IP traffic is throughIP address registration database, which is not very accurate as itdepends on how the ISP registers its IP subnets, that is normallydone in a country/city format.It also assumes that in the future, GPS capability will be added tothe router itself (just like smart phones) and packet marking andclassification based on geo-location will be required.QoS, firewall and routing based on geo-location will be highlyrequired when mobile routers move from one geo-location to anotherwhich has different policy.</t>
