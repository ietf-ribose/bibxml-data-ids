      <t>This document describes IP-LOC, a proposed extension which suggests adding GPS coordinates to IPv6 header. The current method of determining location of IP traffic is through IP address registration database, which is not very accurate as it depends on how the ISP registers its IP subnets, that is normally done in a country/city format. It also assumes that in the future, GPS capability will be added to the router itself (just like smart phones) and packet marking and classification based on geo-location will be required. QoS, firewall and routing based on geo-location will be highly required when mobile routers move from one geo-location to another which has different policy.</t>
