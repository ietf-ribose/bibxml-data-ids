      <t>This memo defines the use of the MPLS TC field of MPLS Label Stack Entries (LSE) to support cycle tagging of packets for Multiple Buffer Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (TCQF). TCQF is a mechanism to support bounded latency forwarding in DetNet network. Target benefits of TCQF include low end-to-end jitter, ease of high- speed hardware implementation, optional ability to support large number of flow in large networks via DiffServ style aggregation by applying TCQF to the DetNet aggregate instead of each DetNet flow individually, and support of wide-area DetNet networks with arbitrary link latencies and latency variations.</t>
