    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a usecase, called enhanced coordinated multi- point (eCoMP), for integreting radio and optical networks. It focus on the fronthaul flexibility that allows "any-RRH_A to any-BBU_A" connection to improve the eCoMP service performance. The procedure of the usecase is based on the unified radio and optical control archtecture, and an extended OpenFlow protocol is introduced to realize the procedure.</t>
