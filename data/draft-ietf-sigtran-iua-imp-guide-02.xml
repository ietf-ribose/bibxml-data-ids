      <t>This document captures problems and issues discovered on the SIGTRAN mailing list and at future bakeoffs for IUA [RFC3057]. This document will be updated after each bakeoff augmenting the existing draft to include any new issues discovered during inter-operability testing. Two basic sets of problems are identified by this draft: first, issues that need to be addressed when the next revision of IUA is created, i.e. issues that should be remembered in a BIS document; second, issues that were found that are strictly implementation problems.</t>
