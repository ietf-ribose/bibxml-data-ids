    <abstract>
      <t>The speed extension to the Mobile Internet Protocol provides a way for the Foreign Agents and Home Agents to perceive the moving speed of the Mobile Nodes. With the speed information popularized in the mobile IP network, the behavior of the Mobile IP implementation with speed adaptive algorithm implemented will automatically adapt to the speed of the Mobile Node so that the performance of the Mobile IP won’t decline dramatically in a rapid moving environment. At the same time, the Mobile IP speed adaptive algorithm only requires reasonable resources that are enough for seamless handoff.</t>
