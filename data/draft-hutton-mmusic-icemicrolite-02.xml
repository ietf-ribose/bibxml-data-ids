      <t>This document proposes a mechanism for conveying multiple IPaddresses of different address families (e.g., IPv4, IPv6) for agiven medium, in the same Session Description Protocol (SDP) offer.This proposed mechanism solves the backward compatibility whichexists with ANAT, due to its syntax, and provides a migration pathtowards support for ICE. The proposed mechanism is significantlyless complex then ICE or ICE-Lite but uses ICE syntax. The mechanismdescribed in this document has been named ICE-microLite.</t>
