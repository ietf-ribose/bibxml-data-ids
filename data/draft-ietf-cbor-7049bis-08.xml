    <abstract>
      <t>The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is a data format whose design goals include the possibility of extremely small code size, fairly small message size, and extensibility without the need for version negotiation. These design goals make it different from earlier binary serializations such as ASN.1 and MessagePack. This document is a revised edition of RFC 7049, with editorial improvements, added detail, and fixed errata. This revision formally obsoletes RFC 7049, while keeping full compatibility of the interchange format from RFC 7049. It does not create a new version of the format.</t>
