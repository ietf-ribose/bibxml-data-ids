    <abstract>
      <t>The Virtual Interface (VI) architecture [VIAR] describes a high performance design for interfacing distributed applications to accelerated protocol processing. VI seeks to improve the performance of such applications by reducing the latency and overheads associated with standard communications protocol stack processing. VI greatly reduces the processing overhead associated with traditional network architectures by providing applications a protected, directly accessible interface to network hardware - a Virtual Interface. This memo describes extensions to the VI Architecture designed to facilitate operation over TCP/IP. These extensions take the form of enhancements to the VI Provider Library API defined in the VI Architecture Developer's Guide [VIDG], and a 'VI Protocol' which supports VI functionality during operation over TCP/IP. The extensions to the VI Architecture which support operation over TCP/IP are intended to be fully compliant with the VI Architecture [VIAR] and its associated Developer's Guide [VIDG].</t>
