      <t>Service establishment in the Open Grid Protocol is the process ofcreating an application layer association between a clientapplication and a remote service responsible for managing an endentity's identity. Before a service may be used, the requestingparty must present credentials, handle any per-entity authentication-time maintenance requirements, and request capabilities the clientintends to use. Peer hosts to be authenticated include end users andremote domain hosts. Multiple mechanisms are defined forauthentication, but all authentication and service establishmentrequests follow the same pattern.</t>
