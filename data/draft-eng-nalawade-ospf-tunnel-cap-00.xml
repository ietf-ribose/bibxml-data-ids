      <t>As increasing number of tunnels are deployed in a Provider core, there is a need for improving the efficiency and ease of tunnel establishment. OSPF running as the IGP in a Provider core, can act as the signalling agent for the Tunnel endpoints. OSPF can carry tunnel endpoint information in the intra-AS scope, easing BGP of the extra burden of signalling within the core.</t>
