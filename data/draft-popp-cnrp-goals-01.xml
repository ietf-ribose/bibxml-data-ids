      <t>This document establishes the context and goals for a Common Name Resolution Protocol. It defines the terminology used concerning a 'Common Name' and how one might be 'resolved', and establishes the distinction between 'resolution' and more elaborate search mechanisms. It establishes some expected contexts for use of Common Name Resolution, and the criteria for evaluating a successful protocol. It also analyzes the various motivations that would cause services to provide Common Name resolution for both public, private and commercial use.</t>
