      <t>In common SIP practice, a two-phase "offer/answer" exchange ofsession description documents negotiates preferences, capabilitiesand requested sessions. However, the structure of the sessiondescription greatly confuses the disambiguation of these elements andthus the clear characterization of sessions. The current workproposes an alternative to the offer/answer model which leveragespre-association between user agents to recast those two phases into aless ambiguous form: an Advertisement of capabilities and preferenceswhich occurs in non-real-time before a session is ever requested,which is followed during session establishment by a unidirectionaland complete Proposal of a session.</t>
