      <t>The wide deployment of wireless devices, with their low installed cost (compared to wired devices), will significantly improve the productivity and safety of industrial plants. It will simultaneously increase the efficiency and safety of the plant's workers, by extending and making more timely the information set available about plant operations. The new Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) defines a Distance Vector protocol that is designed for such networks. The aim of this document is to analyze the applicability of that routing protocol in industrial LLNs formed of field devices.</t>
