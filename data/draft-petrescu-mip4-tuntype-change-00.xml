      <t>The protocol Mobile IPv4 may use a number of encapsulation methodsbetween an MN and its HA. The UDP method is used to perform NATTraversal (if a NAT sits between MN and HA) whereas IP-in-IP methodmay be used if there is no NAT (CoA is a publicly routable address).Although these methods are individually specified, a mechanism forchanging between one to another is not, which may lead to incoherentimplementations.This draft briefly presents the scenario of a MN performing ahandover between private space (NAT) and public space (non-NAT), theimplementation problem (type of tunnel can not be changeddynamically), and some potential solutions as textual modifications,better implementations, or protocol extensions.</t>
