      <t>The protocol Mobile IPv4 may use a number of encapsulation methods between an MN and its HA. The UDP method is used to perform NAT Traversal (if a NAT sits between MN and HA) whereas IP-in-IP method may be used if there is no NAT (CoA is a publicly routable address). Although these methods are individually specified, a mechanism for changing between one to another is not, which may lead to incoherent implementations. This draft briefly presents the scenario of a MN performing a handover between private space (NAT) and public space (non-NAT), the implementation problem (type of tunnel can not be changed dynamically), and some potential solutions as textual modifications, better implementations, or protocol extensions.</t>
