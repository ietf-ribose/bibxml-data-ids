      <t>Real-time applications like VoIP in mobile networks need smoothhandovers in order to minimize or eliminate packet loss as a mobilenode (MN) transitions between network links. This document definesa buffering mechanism for IPv6 by which an MN can request that therouter on its current subnet buffers packets on its behalf while theMN completes registration procedures with the router of a new subnet.Once the registration is complete and the MN has a valid care-ofaddress in the new network, the buffered packets can be forwardedfrom the previous router, thus reducing the possibility of packetloss during the transition</t>
