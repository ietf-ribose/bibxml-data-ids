      <t>[IKE] allows a device to set up a secure session by using a bidirectional authentication method using either pre-shared keys or digital certificates. However [IKE] does not provide a method to leverage legacy authentication methods which are widely deployed today. This document describes a method for using existing unidirectional authentication mechanisms such as RADIUS, SecurID, and OTP within IPSec's ISAKMP protocol. The purpose of this draft is not to replace or enhance the existing authentication mechanisms described in [IKE], but rather to allow them to be extended using legacy authentication mechanisms.</t>
