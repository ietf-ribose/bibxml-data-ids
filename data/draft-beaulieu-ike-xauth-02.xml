      <t>[IKE] allows a device to set up a secure session by using abidirectional authentication method using either pre-shared keys ordigital certificates. However [IKE] does not provide a method toleverage legacy authentication methods which are widely deployedtoday.This document describes a method for using existing unidirectionalauthentication mechanisms such as RADIUS, SecurID, and OTP withinIPSec's ISAKMP protocol. The purpose of this draft is not toreplace or enhance the existing authentication mechanisms describedin [IKE], but rather to allow them to be extended using legacyauthentication mechanisms.</t>
