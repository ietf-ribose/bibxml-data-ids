    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an encapsulation of a Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) document within a MIME message. The document may be represented in the message by some or all of its components. The MIME message may also include auxiliary information to be used by the recipient in processing the encapsulated SGML. This document proposes a new content sub-type Application/SGML-notation, and a new header, Content-SGML-Entity. This specification uses the proposed Multipart/Related Content-Type [RFC-1872] which provides the mechanism for treating the set of SGML components as a single object.</t>
