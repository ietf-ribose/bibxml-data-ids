      <t>Seeking entries from a directory is a process involving network resources. It is assumed that a directory is accessed for reading and searching data more than for modification purposes. Under such assumptions, for performance reasons, a mechanism for caching as a proxy which caches all entries is desirable. This document describes a mechanism for caching directory entries. This document also defines one operational attribute and two controls required to be implemented for the caching model.</t>
