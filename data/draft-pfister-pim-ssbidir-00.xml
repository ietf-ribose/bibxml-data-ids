      <t>This document adds Source-Specific capabilities to the Bidirectional Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM-BIDIR) routing protocol. Similarly to PIM-BIDIR, multicast traffic is always forwarded to the RP Link, but packets are also filtered based on their source address and source-specific subscription state. This operation mode is backwards compatible with PIM-BIDIR, provides a simpler alternative to PIM-SM and does not suffer when the multicast source location cannot be determined.</t>
