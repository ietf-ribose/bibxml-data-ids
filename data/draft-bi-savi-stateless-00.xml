    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the procedure for creating bindings between astateless address (including Stateless Autoconfiguration Address,manually configured non-static address, etc) and an anchor (refer to[SAVI-framework]) on SAVI (Source Address Validation Improvements)device. The bindings can be used to filter packets generated on thelocal link with forged IP addresses. Different from other proposedsolution for stateless address (e.g., SAVI-FCFS), this solutionfollows RFC4862 to arbitrate the ownership of address. Supplementalbinding processes are also specified to cover conditions that cannotbe handled by control packet snooping.</t>
