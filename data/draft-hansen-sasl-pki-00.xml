      <t>This document defines a user/password Simple Authentication and Security Layer(SASL) mechanism called the PKI mechanism. The PKI mechanism is intended to be used in situations where (1) passwords must be encrypted, (2) the password must be recoverable, and (3) using TLS in combination with a SASL mechanism such as PLAIN is inappropriate. NOTE: This document is a straw proposal to see what interest there is in having a SASL mechanism such as this. See the first section below for more information on why this mechanism is needed.</t>
