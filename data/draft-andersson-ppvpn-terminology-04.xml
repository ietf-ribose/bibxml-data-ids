      <t>The provider provisioned VPN solutions has attracted a great deal of interest. Memos proposing different and overlapping solution have been discussed on the PPVPN mailing list and in the Working Group meetings. This has lead to a development of a partly new set of concepts used to describe the set of VPN services. To a certain extent there are more than one term covering the same concept and sometimes the same term covers more than on concept. The terminology needs to be made clearer and more intuitive. This document seeks to fill at least part of that need.</t>
