    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines the Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) framework, which provides both header compression and fragmentation functionalities. SCHC has been tailored for Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN). SCHC compression is based on a common static context stored in both the LPWAN devices and the network side. This document defines a header compression mechanism and its application to compress IPv6/UDP headers. This document also specifies a fragmentation and reassembly mechanism that is used to support the IPv6 MTU requirement over the LPWAN technologies. Fragmentation is needed for IPv6 datagrams that, after SCHC compression or when such compression was not possible, still exceed the layer two maximum payload size. The SCHC header compression and fragmentation mechanisms are independent of the specific LPWAN technology over which they are used. Note that this document defines generic functionalities and advisedly offers flexibility with regard to parameter settings and mechanism choices. Such settings and choices are expected to be made in other technology-specific documents.</t>
