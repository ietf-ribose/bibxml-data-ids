      <t>This draft describes a limited flooding approach to address the problem of routing scalability in link state IGPs. The solution is based on decomposition of a routing area into 'zones' and the restriction of the exchange of routing information between zones. This approach introduces an extra level in the isolation of knowledge within a routing domain. The advantage of this solution is that it considerably decreases the amount of information flooded in link state advertisements and reduces the size of the link-state database (and traffic engineering entries) on network elements utilizing link state protocols. The technique presented in this document has been particularized to OSPF in order to make the discussion practical and concrete. However, the underlying concepts are very general and similar modifications can be easily applied to other IGPs, such as ISIS.</t>
