    <abstract>
      <t>Being able to securely retrieve information from sensors and control actuators while providing guards against distributed denial-of- service (DDoS) attacks are key requirements for CoAP deployments. To that aim, a security protocol (e.g., DTLS, TLS, or OSCORE) can be enabled to ensure secure CoAP operation, including protection against many attacks. This document identifies a set of known CoAP attacks and shows that simply using CoAP with a security protocol is not always enough for secure operation. Several of the identified attacks can be mitigated with a security protocol providing confidentiality and integrity combined with the solutions specified in RFC 9175.</t>
