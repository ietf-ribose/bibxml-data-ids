      <t>Many distributed applications may benefit from a high bandwidth connection to the Internet. However, this requires high bandwidth links between remotes sites. A low-cost solution to deliver high bandwidth services over wide geographical areas via the use of broadcast satellite networks has been proposed by [ASBD]. However, this solution is based on low cost receivers with zero bandwidth return. Connection over the satellite link is therefore unidirectional. The integration of these satellite networks with the Internet requires changes in common routing protocols.</t>
