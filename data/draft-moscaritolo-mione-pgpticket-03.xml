      <t>OpenPGP specifies message formats and certificate formats used for exchange of encrypted and/or authenticated objects. This document discusses methods of extending OpenPGP's message formats to support an authorization system. This system would use public key cryptography to authenticate a user to a server and establish the user's access permissions. The concept is that the user acquires a ticket signed by some issuer that specifies what they are entitled to do. That ticket is then submitted to a server. The server uses a challenge/response method to verify that the holder really has the matching private key. The server then allows the access specified.</t>
