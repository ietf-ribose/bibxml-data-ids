      <t>This document discusses the architecture and application scenarios of fused service function chain. Fused service function chain means that two or more service function chains are fused to become a single service function chain from the view of data plane and control plane. Fused service function chain is a expansion for service function chain. Anyhow, some mechanism or methods need to be used when two or more service function chains are fused to be a single service function chain based on architecture described in this memo.</t>
