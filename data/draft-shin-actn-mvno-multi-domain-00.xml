    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides a use-case that addresses the need for virtual network operation for mobile operators, which is facilitated by the application of network abstraction. These abstractions shall create a virtual network operation environment supporting mobile operators in viewing, managing and operating multi-domains of many dimensions (e.g., radio access, backhaul transport, mobile DC edge, mobile DC core, packet/optical transport for DC interconnect, etc.) as a single virtualized network. This use-case considers the application of these abstractions and the need for the associated operational mechanisms within the network of a single operator.</t>
