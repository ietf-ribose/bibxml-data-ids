    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies the control plane procedures to support Traffic Engineering (TE) across TRILL sites where such sites are interconnected using [1] with the help of a Layer 3 core running IP+GRE or IP+MPLS. Traffic Engineering permits usage of a set of links that possess a certain characteristic like specified bandwidth, cost or even MTU. This draft aims at addressing how unicast frames travelling from one TRILL site to another across a Layer 3 core that supports IP+GRE and/or IP+MPLS can make use of the TE calculated paths in the sending site as well as the receiving site where such TE paths are pre-computed in both sites and need a mechanism to inter- link them together.</t>
