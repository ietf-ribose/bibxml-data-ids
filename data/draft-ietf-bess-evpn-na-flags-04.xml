    <abstract>
      <t>An EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route can optionally carry an IPv4 or IPv6 addresses associated with a MAC address. Remote PEs can use this information to reply locally (act as proxy) to IPv4 ARP requests and IPv6 Neighbor Solicitation messages and reduce/suppress the flooding produced by the Address Resolution procedure. The information conveyed in the MAC/IP route may not be enough for the remote PE to reply to local ARP or ND requests. For example, if a PE learns an IPv6-&gt;MAC ND entry via EVPN, the PE would not know if that particular IPv6-&gt;MAC pair belongs to a host, a router or a host with an anycast address, as this information is not carried in the MAC/IP route advertisements. Similarly, other information relevant to the IP-&gt;MAC ARP/ND entries may be needed. This document defines an extended community that is advertised along with an EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement route and carries information relevant to the ARP/ND resolution, so that an EVPN PE implementing a proxy-ARP/ND function can reply to ARP Requests or Neighbor Solicitations with the correct information.</t>
