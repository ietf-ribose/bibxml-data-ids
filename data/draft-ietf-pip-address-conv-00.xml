      <t>Pip is an internet protocol intended as the replacement for IP version 4. Pip is a general purpose internet protocol, designed to handle all forseeable internet protocol requirements. This specification is one of a number of documents that specify the operation of Pip. This specification describes the conventions for using the various Pip addresses--the hierarchical unicast address, the class-D style multicast address, the CBT multicast address, and the nearcast address. This specification does not describe how Pip addresses are assigned.</t>
