    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes an extension used to convey information about media frames, that is used for specific handling by network nodes, including error recovery and congestion handling. These functions can be critical to improve energy efficiency and network capacity in some (especially wireless) networks. Due to the end-to-end encryption performed in MOQ, MOQ relays are expected to implement these functions, and unencrypted metadata will be exposed to MOQ relays. Since we are in the early stages of MOQ protocol design, this document initially proposes base protocol requirements.</t>
