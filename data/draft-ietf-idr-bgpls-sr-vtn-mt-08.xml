    <abstract>
      <t>Enhanced VPNs aim to deliver VPN services with enhanced characteristics to customers who have specific requirements on their connectivity, such as guaranteed resources, and bounded latency or jitter. Enhanced VPNs require integration between the overlay VPN connectivity and the characteristics provided by the underlay network. A Network Resource Partition (NRP) is a subset of the network resources and associated policies on each of a connected set of links in the underlay network. An NRP could be used as the underlay to support one or a group of enhanced VPN services. When Segment Routing (SR) is used for building NRPs, each NRP can be allocated with a group of Segment Identifiers (SIDs) to identify the topology and resource attributes of network segments in the NRP. In some network scenarios, each NRP can be associated with a unique logical network topology. When a centralized network controller is used for NRP-specific constraint-based path computation, especially when an NRP spans multiple IGP areas or multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes), Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS) is needed to advertise the NRP topology and associated resource information to the network controller. This document describes a mechanism to distribute the information of SR based NRPs using BGP-Link State (BGP-LS) with Multi-Topology (MT).</t>
