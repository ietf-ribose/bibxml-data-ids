      <t>This memo describes a packetization scheme for MPEG video and audio streams. The scheme proposed can be used to transport such a video or audio flow over the transport protocols supported by RTP. Two approaches are described. The first is designed to support maximum interoperability with MPEG System environments. The second is designed to provide maximum compatibility with other RTP-encapsulated media streams and future conference control work of the IETF. Most of this memo is identical to RFC 2250, an Internet standards track RTP payload format definition. No changes have been made in the packet formats on the wire. The main reason for this revision is to allow the use of this payload format with dynamic payload types that can specify the timestamp clock frequency by non-RTP means for improved jitter compensation. We used this opportunity to improve the description of the payload format specification by clarifying some wording that have been reported to be problematic.</t>
