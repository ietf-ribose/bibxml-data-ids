      <t>This document describes how to provide Internet connectivity to mobile ad hoc networks. It describes a mechanism whereby the Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing protocol can cooperate with the Mobile IP protocol such that mobile nodes within an ad hoc network, which are out of direct transmission range of a foreign agent, can obtain a care-of address and register with the foreign agent to obtain Internet connectivity. Mobile IP is used for mobile node registrations with a foreign agent, while AODV is used for routing within the ad hoc network and for obtaining routes to the foreign agent. Once a manet node has a care-of address, it may send data packets to destinations in the Internet by routing through the foreign agent.</t>
