      <t>Autonomic functions need a control plane to communicate, which depends on some addressing and routing. This Autonomic Control Plane should ideally be self-managing, and as independent as possible of configuration. One application is a "virtual out of band channel" for communications over a network that is not configured or mis- configured. This document describes requirements and implementation options for an "Autonomic Control Plane".</t>
