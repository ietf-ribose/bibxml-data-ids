      <t>This draft explores several possible remedies for a set of issues that have been identified with the Session Initiation Protocol's non- INVITE transaction. These proposed solutions are in rough form and have not yet accumulated working group consensus. They range from minor extensions to protocol behavior to fundamentally changing the non-INVITE transaction model.</t>
