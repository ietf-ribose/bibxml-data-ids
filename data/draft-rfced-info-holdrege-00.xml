      <t>This memo describes the Control Protocol used between a Network Access Server (NAS) and a Signaling Gateway (SG). The requirements of this protocol are Call Control, Circuit Maintenance and Resource Management. This protocol must be reliable in nature and support redundant links between the NAS and SG. It's important to note that the NAS could be handling either packetized voice or data for access to the Internet.</t>
