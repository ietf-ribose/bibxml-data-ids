      <t>The rapid growth of Forwarding Information Base (FIB) has raisedconcerns among many Internet Service Providers. One potentialsolution to this problem is FIB aggregation, i.e. letting each routeraggregate its FIB entries without affecting the forwarding pathstaken by data traffic. It is a simple local software optimizationwithin a router, requiring no changes to routing protocols or routerhardware. To understand the effectiveness of using FIB aggregationto extend router lifetime, in this draft we present several FIBaggregation algorithms and evaluate their performance using routingtables and updates collected from tens of networks. Our results showthat FIB aggregation can reduce the FIB table size by as much as 70%with small computational overhead. We also show that thecomputational overhead can be controlled through various mechanisms.</t>
