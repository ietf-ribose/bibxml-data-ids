      <t>Industry needs the CDN interconnection to provide the CDN service that may cover a wider geographical area and a better service quality. In the real pragmatic operation, the relationship between two CDNs should concern many factors(for instance, CDN or CP may select the downstream CDN based on some principals or conditions or service authorizations), hence the CDN interconnection is defacto a sort of constrained interconnection. This document will give the use cases to indicate the models of how the CDN interconnection may be used and the associated examples for the use cases will be listed subsequently.</t>
