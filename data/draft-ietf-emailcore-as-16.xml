    <abstract>
      <t>Electronic mail is one of the oldest Internet applications that is still in very active use. While the basic protocols and formats for mail transport and message formats have evolved slowly over the years, events and thinking in more recent years have supplemented those core protocols with additional features and suggestions for their use. This Applicability Statement describes the relationship among many of those protocols and provides guidance and makes recommendations for the use of features of the core protocols. Open Issues * #92 - CNAME handling in "5.1. Locating the Target Host" (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/92): Per IETF 120, Klensin to propose text. * #113 - More explanation of the advantages of transport and encryption between SMTP systems... probably in the A/S (https://github.com/ietf-wg-emailcore/emailcore/issues/113): What, if anything, needs to be done here?</t>
