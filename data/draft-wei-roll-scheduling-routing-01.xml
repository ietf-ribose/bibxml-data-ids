    <abstract>
      <t>Low power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) have unique characteristics compared with traditional wired and ad-hoc networks. Low Latency Deterministic Networks(LLDN) is specified in IEEE 802.15.4e which is for deterministic applications in the industrial environment. Some routing metrics and constraints has been described in [RFC6551], [RFC5867] [RFC5826], [RFC5673], and [RFC5548]. There are several special characteristics and requirements in the industrial environment. This document defines a new Link Metric/Constraint Object-Scheduling Waiting Time to make RPL support deterministic scheduling mechanism, which could improve the determinacy and reliability of the LLNs in industrial environment.</t>
