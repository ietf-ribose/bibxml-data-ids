    <abstract>
      <t>Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques and many MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly in very high bandwidth applications, such as provider IP/MPLS core networks. MPLS-TP has discouraged the use of multipath techniques. Some degradation of MPLS-TP OAM performance cannot be avoided when operating over current high bandwidth multipath implementations. The tradeoffs involved in using multipath techniques with MPLS and MPLS-TP are described. Requirements are discussed which enable full MPLS-TP compliant LSP including full OAM capability to be carried over MPLS LSP which are traversing multipath links. Other means of supporting MPLS-TP coexisting with MPLS and multipath are discussed.</t>
