      <t>Many MPLS implementations have supported multipath techniques andmany MPLS deployments have used multipath techniques, particularly invery high bandwidth applications, such as provider IP/MPLS corenetworks. MPLS-TP has discouraged the use of multipath techniques.Some degradation of MPLS-TP OAM performance cannot be avoided whenoperating over current high bandwidth multipath implementations.The tradeoffs involved in using multipath techniques with MPLS andMPLS-TP are described. Requirements are discussed which enable fullMPLS-TP compliant LSP including full OAM capability to be carriedover MPLS LSP which are traversing multipath links. Other means ofsupporting MPLS-TP coexisting with MPLS and multipath are discussed.</t>
