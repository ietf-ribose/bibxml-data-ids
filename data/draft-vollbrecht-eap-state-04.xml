      <t>This document describes a set of state machines for EAP Peer, EAPAuthenticator (supporting local, passthrough and backend), for EAPPassthrough method, and for 'backend adapter' that adapts EAP trafficcarried by an AAA protocol such as RADIUS or Diameter to a BackendAuthenticator. This set of state machines shows how EAP can beimplemented to support deployment in either a Peer/AP or Peer/AP/AAAServer environmnet. The Peer and Authenticator machines areillustrative of how the EAP protocol defined in[I-D.ietf-eap-rfc2284bis] may be implemented. The Passtrhoughmethod and 'backend adapter' illustrate how EAP protocol supportdefined in [I-D.aboba-radius-rfc2869bis] may be implemented. Wherethere are differences [I-D.ietf-eap-rfc2284bis]/[I-D.aboba-radius-rfc2869bis] are authoritative.This document describes a state machine based on an EAP 'Switch'model. This model includes events and actions for the interactionbetween the EAP Switch and EAP methods. The State Machine andassociated model are informative only. Implementations may achievethe same results using different methods.A brief description of the EAP 'Switch' model is given in theIntroduction section.This document is still a work in progress. The authors believe itcorresponds to the current state of revisions to the defining[I-D.ietf-eap-rfc2284bis]/[I-D.aboba-radius-rfc2869bis] documents,but it has not been vetted by the EAP working group as a whole. Anappendix to this document points out issues the authors believe stillneed to be resolved between the documents. The intent is tosynchronize this document with [I-D.ietf-eap-rfc2284bis] and[I-D.aboba-radius-rfc2869bis] revisions when they are released andthen submit it as an RFC.</t>
