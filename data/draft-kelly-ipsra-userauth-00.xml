      <t>IPsec, when used with IKE [RFC2409], provides for authentication ofendpoints from the device level to the user level. However, there hasbeen movement within the IPsec development community to provideadditional support for legacy user-level authentication mechanismssuch as those supported by RADIUS [RFC2138]. At least 2 approaches tothis problem have been proposed thus far, both using the same basicunderlying framework, but that underlying framework relies uponextending IKE in ways that may not be prudent. This documentproposes an alternative approach which provides much of the samefunctionality without requiring any modification to the existingIPsec framework.</t>
