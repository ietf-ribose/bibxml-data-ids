      <t>The photonic firewall oriented routing and spectrum allocation strategy in elastic optical networks is proposed. For the security detecting requirement, each light-path should pass through at least a photonic firewall. To reduce the blocking rate and improve the spectrum efficiency, the whole network is divided into several parts according to the locations of all deployed photonic firewalls. A photonic firewall is responsible for the security detecting for each part. This strategy has a low complexity and is suitable for large- scale optical networks.</t>
