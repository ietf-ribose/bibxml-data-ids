      <t>Several MANET routing protocols have been recently promoted to experimental RFCs. However, autoconfiguration of MANET networks is still an unsettled area. This document proposes a protocol for autoconfiguration for both IPv4 or IPv6. Its corner stone is an conflict-detection algorithm. It aims at conceptual simplicity: essentially, each node periodically sends its addresses and an identifier. Conflicts are detected as identifier mismatches. This protocol might be used with any MANET protocol, although it naturally suits the OLSR routing protocol (on which we focus), with a light increase of control message overhead.</t>
