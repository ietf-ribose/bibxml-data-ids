      <t>This document is a revision of RFC 1602, which defines the official procedures for creating and documenting Internet Standards. Changes from RFC 1602 are marked by change bars ( | ) in the right margin. This revision (revision 3.1) includes changes made primarily in response to a preliminary legal review of the written procedures of the Internet standards process by Internet Society counsel. The conclusions of the legal review may be summarized briefly as follows: 'Based on the principles found in the case law and enforcement agency pronouncements, a good standard setting program should have at a minimum the following characteristics: (1) openness in participation; (2) careful and thorough record keeping throughout the various stages of setting the standard; (3) timely and adequate notice of both the initiation and development of a standard; (4) careful consideration of, and response to, all the views and objections of interested persons; and (5) a meaningful appeals process.'</t>
