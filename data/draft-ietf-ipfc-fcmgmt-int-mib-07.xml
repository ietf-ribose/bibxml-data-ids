      <t>The goal of this document is to fill in missing pieces necessary to enable an enterprise class storage network. One of the more important features of an enterprise class storage network is management; this document gives a framework MIB that will provide an integrated management environment for the enterprise customer. An enterprise class storage network is comprised of elements (i.e., hubs, switches, converters, gateways, and HBAs) that are developed by many different vendors. The large number of vendors that can exist in a storage network makes mangement a very hard and complicated problem. The main goal of this document's MIB is to enable interoperability among the various vendors involved in the Fibre Channel marketplace.</t>
