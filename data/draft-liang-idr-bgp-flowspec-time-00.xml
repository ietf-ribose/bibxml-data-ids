      <t>The BGP flow specification (FlowSpec) is an additional tool to mitigate the effects of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Since DDoS attacks are dynamic, filtering of a flow may only be necessary for some specified time, and be undesirable at other times. This document proposes a new BGP path attribute called "Flow Extended Attribute", which carries expected valid period information for a FlowSpec rule. So network administrators can control certain types of traffic in a specified period.</t>
