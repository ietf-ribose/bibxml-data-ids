      <t>EAP-pwd is an EAP method that uses a shared password for authentication using a technique that is resistant to dictionary attack. It included support for raw keys and [RFC2759]-style double hashing of a password but did not include support for salted passwords. There are many existing databases of salted passwords and it is desirable to allow their use with EAP-pwd.</t>
