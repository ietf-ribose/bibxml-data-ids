      <t>This document compares and contrasts four approaches to Frame Relay encapsulation over a pseudo-wire that have been proposed in the Pseudo-Wire Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) IETF working group. This document then shows that the general-purpose encapsulation previously proposed for HDLC, Ethernet and VLAN is also the most efficient approach for Frame Relay.</t>
