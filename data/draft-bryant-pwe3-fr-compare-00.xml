      <t>This document compares and contrasts four approaches to Frame Relayencapsulation over a pseudo-wire that have been proposed in thePseudo-Wire Edge-to-Edge (PWE3) IETF working group. This documentthen shows that the general-purpose encapsulation previouslyproposed for HDLC, Ethernet and VLAN is also the most efficientapproach for Frame Relay.</t>
