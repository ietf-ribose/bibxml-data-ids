    <abstract>
      <t>This document extends RFC 6550, RFC 6553, and RFC 8138 to enable a RPL Root to install and maintain Projected Routes within its domain. A Projected Route is one that is computed by a central entity, such as a Path Computation Engine (PCE) and installed in the routers that instantiate it, using the procedures defined here. The routes are installed along a selected set of nodes that may or may not include itself, for a chosen duration. This potentially enables routes that are more optimized or resilient than those obtained with the classical distributed operation of RPL, either in terms of the size of a Routing Header or in terms of path length, which impacts both the latency and the packet delivery ratio.</t>
