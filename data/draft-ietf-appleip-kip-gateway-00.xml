      <t>This memo was started as an effort to describe ``IPTalk'' for the AppleTalk-IP Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It became apparent that since no protocol standard or description existed that implementation specific information was unavoidable. KIP is the prototypical AppleTalk/IP Gateway implementation and is available in source form. KIP's functionality forms the basis for many commercial products available today.</t>
