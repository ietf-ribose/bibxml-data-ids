      <t>Recent work on Locator/ID Separation has focused primarily on the control plane protocols concerned with finding Identifier-to-Locator mappings. However, experience gained with a trial deployment of a system designed to implement Locator/ID Separation has revealed two general classes of problems which must be resolved after the mapping is found: The Locator Path Liveness Problem and the State Synchronization Problem. These problems have implications for the data plane as well as the control plane.</t>
