      <t>This document specifies a network header that is a type of compressed IPv4 or IPv6 header. The use case is high performance networking in limited domains, in particular in scale-up networks for AI where even modest packet overhead packet may be materially detrimental to overall performance. The SUNH network header provides three primary benefits: 1) It reduces the amount of on-the-wire protocol overhead, 2) It simplifies route lookup to be more efficient with lower latency, 3) It retains the properties and benefits of a Network Layer header including compatibility with deployed Ethernet switches and NICs.</t>
