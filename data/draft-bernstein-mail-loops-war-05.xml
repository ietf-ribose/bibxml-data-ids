      <t>An automailer means any program that receives a mail message and automatically sends one or more mail messages. This term is meant to include not only a mail-based server, such as a mailing list exploder or a vacation program, but also an SMTP server, which receives a message from the network and relays it to a local or remote user. In a network full of automailers, any mistake can cause a mail loop. Since some automailers generate several outputs in response to a single input, a loop can produce an exponential explosion of mail. All the automailers in the qmail package follow a general philosophy designed to prevent mail loops and limit the damage from any loops that do occur. These automailers have been repeatedly observed to fail safe: they stop loops in the face of typical failures by other hosts. This document explains the philosophy and describes the automailers.</t>
