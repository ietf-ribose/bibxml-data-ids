    <abstract>
      <t>A Network Service Header(NSH) is imposed encapsulates a packet or a frame for Service Function Chaining. The resulting packet, in turn, is encapsulate according to transport layer. The NSH contains a Service Path Identifier (SPI) and a Service Index (SI). The SPI is, as per its name, an identifier. The SPI alone cannot be used to forward packets along a service path. Rather, the SPI provides a level of indirection between the service path / topology and the network transport encapsulation. For different transport encapsulations, this document provides the format information with transport and NSH, and gives operational constraints that transport technologies, used by NSH need to meet.</t>
