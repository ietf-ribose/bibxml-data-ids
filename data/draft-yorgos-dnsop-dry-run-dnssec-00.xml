    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a method called "dry-run DNSSEC" that allows for testing DNSSEC deployments without affecting the DNS service in case of DNSSEC errors. It accomplishes that by introducing a new DS Type Digest Algorithm that signals to validating resolvers that dry- run DNSSEC is used for the zone. DNSSEC errors are then reported with DNS Error Reporting, but the bogus response is withheld. Instead resolvers fallback from dry-run DNSSEC and provide the response that would have been answered without the presence of a dry- run DS. A further option is presented for clients to opt-in for dry- run DNSSEC errors and allow for end-to-end DNSSEC testing.</t>
