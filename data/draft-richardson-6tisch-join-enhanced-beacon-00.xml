      <t>In TSCH mode of 802.15.4, as described by [I-D.ietf-6tisch-minimal], opportunities for broadcasts are limited to specific times and specific channels. An enhanced beacon must be broadcast periodically by every router to keep all nodes in sync. This document provides a mechanism by which small details critical for new nodes (pledges) and long sleeping nodes may be carried within the Enhanced Beacon.</t>
