      <t>The ITU-T has defined an architecture and requirements for operatingan Automatically Switched Optical Network (ASON).The Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocol suiteis designed to provide a control plane for a range of networktechnologies including optical networks such as time divisionmultiplexing (TDM) networks including SONET/SDH and Optical TransportNetworks (OTNs), and lambda switching optical networks.The requirements for GMPLS routing to satisfy the requirements ofASON routing, and an evaluation of existing GMPLS routing protocolsare provided in other documents. This document defines extensions tothe OSPFv2 Link State Routing Protocol to meet the requirements forrouting in an ASON.Note that this work is scoped to the requirements and evaluationexpressed in RFC 4258 and RFC 4652 and the ITU-T Recommendationscurrent when those documents were written. Future extensions ofrevisions of this work may be necessary if the ITU-T Recommendationsare revised or if new requirements are introduced into a revision ofRFC 4258.</t>
