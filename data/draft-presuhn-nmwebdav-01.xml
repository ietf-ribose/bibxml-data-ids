      <t>This memo examines the potential of using WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) technologies to address the problems of network configuration management. It reviews requirements and issues that have been identified in IETF network configuration management and operator requirements discussions, matching these requirements and issues with various WebDAV facilities. It concludes by identifying areas for further exploration. Comments are welcomed, both from the Operations and Management Area in general, and from participants in the webdav and deltav working groups in particular. Please send comments to the author at randy_presuhn@bmc.com.</t>
