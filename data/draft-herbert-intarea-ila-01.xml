    <abstract>
      <t>This specification describes identifier-locator addressing (ILA) for IPv6. Identifier-locator addressing differentiates between location and identity of a network node. Part of an address expresses the immutable identity of the node, and another part indicates the location of the node which can be dynamic. Identifier-locator addressing can be used to efficiently implement overlay networks for network virtualization as well as solutions for use cases in mobility.</t>
