      <t>This document describes a Virtual List View extension for the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Search operation. This extension is designed to allow the 'virtual list box' feature, common in existing commercial e-mail address book applications, to be supported efficiently by LDAP servers. LDAP servers' inability to support this client feature is a significant impediment to LDAP replacing proprietary protocols in commercial e-mail systems. The extension allows a client to specify that the server return, for a given LDAP search with associated sort keys, a contiguous subset of the search result set. This subset is specified in terms of offsets into the ordered list, or in terms of a greater than or equal comparison value.</t>
