      <t>The Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) defines mechanisms for extensibility. The mechanisms provided are for Attribute-Value Pair (AVP) fields received in control messages to be set as Mandatory or not. This document specifies a mechanism whereby an L2TP implementation can signal its support of the set of L2TP extensions that it supports. This then allows the L2TP implementations to use extensions such as L2TP message types not defined in [1], the presence of existing AVPs in messages they are not currently defined to be in, and the definition of new AVPs that can be marked as Mandatory, beyond those defined in [1].</t>
