      <t>SIP as defined in RFC 3261 [1] defines a Via header as a construct tobe used for upstream response routing and for downstream assistancein loop detection. There is an increasing need on downstreamadministrative domains (ADs) to gain visibility into all the ADs inits upstream path. The information needed is not IP based asinternal architectures at upstream ADs is of no consequence todownstream ADs. Logical domain marking, however, is desperatelyneeded for any traffic analysis to occur at the receiving side.Gathering AD information from Via headers is non obvious and in manyinstances nearly impossible. This documents identifies therequirements for addressing this issue.</t>
