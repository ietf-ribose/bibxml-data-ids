      <t>This draft addresses the problems of routing datagrams to nodes located in an IPv6 mobile network. A mobile network is one or more IP-subnets attached to a mobile router and mobile as a unit. The mobile router dynamically changes its point of attachment. Applications of mobile networks include networks attached to people (PANs) and networks of sensors deployed in an aircraft, a boat, or a car.</t>
