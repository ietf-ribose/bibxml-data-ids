      <t>This document discusses common practices used in deploying routing protocols in both public and private networks. The focus is not to describe how routing protocols should be deployed, but rather how they are generally deployed, to provide those working on specifications which impact the operation of routing protocols with guidance in what will likely be deployed, or what will likely not be deployed. The focus in thie document will be ionterdomain routing, but it will cover aspects of intradomain routing, as well.1. Background When considering new extensions to existing routing protocols, it's useful to consider them in the context of existing usage of these protocols. Various questions come to mind, such as: o Common Underlying Principles of Network Designs o Common Practices in Route Origination o Common Practices in Routing Database Management o Common Practices in Aggregation o Common Practices in Peering o Common Practices in Security o.... Each of these topics will be covered in a separate section below.</t>
