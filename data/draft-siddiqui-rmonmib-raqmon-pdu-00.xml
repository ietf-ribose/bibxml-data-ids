This memo alsooutlines mechanisms to use Real Time Transport Control Protocol(RTCP) and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to transportthese PDUs between RAQMON Data Source (RDS) and RAQMON ReportCollector (RRC) as outlined in RAQMON Charter of the RMON Workgroup.The memo [SIDDIQUI2] defines a Real-Time Application QOS Monitoring(RAQMON) Framework that extends the RMON Framework to allow Real-timeApplication QoS information as outlined by RAQMON Charter of the RMONWorkgroup.The memo [SIDDIQUI1] defines a portion of the Management InformationBase (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internetcommunity. The document proposes an extension to the RemoteMonitoring MIB [RFC2819] to accommodate RAQMON solution.Distribution of this memo is unlimited.</t>
