      <t>This document proposes the use of OAuth to obtain and validate ephemeral tokens that can be used for TURN authentication. The usage of ephemeral tokens ensure that access to a TURN server can be controlled even if the tokens are compromised, as is the case in WebRTC where TURN credentials must be specified in Javascript. It also addresses the need for stronger authentication described in [I-D.reddy-behave-turn-auth].</t>
