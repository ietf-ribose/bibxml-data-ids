      <t>This draft defines a modification of the use of the SIP protocol toperform route reservation. These modifications are applied to two ofthe existing SIP Methods: INVITE and REGISTER. The modificationsallow the INVITE method to be used to find the best path across aparticular network based on QoS metrics. The route choice is able tobe restricted at the network edge. The proposed modifications alsoallow the REGISTER method to be used as a means of disseminatinginformation necessary to determine these QoS metrics. Thisinformation can be used to route INVITEs away from known areas ofcongestion.</t>
