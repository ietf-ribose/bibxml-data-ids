      <t>This draft defines a modification of the use of the SIP protocol to perform route reservation. These modifications are applied to two of the existing SIP Methods: INVITE and REGISTER. The modifications allow the INVITE method to be used to find the best path across a particular network based on QoS metrics. The route choice is able to be restricted at the network edge. The proposed modifications also allow the REGISTER method to be used as a means of disseminating information necessary to determine these QoS metrics. This information can be used to route INVITEs away from known areas of congestion.</t>
