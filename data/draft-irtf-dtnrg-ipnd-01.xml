      <t>Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) IP Neighbor Discovery (IPND), isa method for otherwise oblivious nodes to learn of the existence,availability, and addresses of other DTN participants. IPND bothsends and listens for small IP UDP announcement "beacons." Beaconmessages are addressed to an IP unicast, multicast, or broadcastdestination to discover specified remote neighbors, or unspecifiedlocal neighbors in the topology, e.g. within wireless range. IPNDbeacons advertise neighbor availability by including the DTN node'scanonical endpoint identifier. IPND beacons optionally includeservice availability and parameters. In this way, neighbor discoveryand service discovery may be coupled or decoupled as required. Oncediscovered, new neighbor pairs use advertised availabilities toconnect, exchange routing information, etc. This document describesDTN IPND.</t>
