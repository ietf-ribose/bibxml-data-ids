    <abstract>
      <t>The term "measured component" refers to an object within the attester's target environment whose state can be sampled and typically digested using a cryptographic hash function. Examples of measured components include firmware stored in flash memory, software loaded into memory at start time, data stored in a file system, or values in a CPU register. This document provides the information model for the "measured component" and two associated data models. This separation is intentional: the JSON and CBOR serializations, coupled with the media types and associated CoAP Content-Formats, enable the immediate use of the semantics within the EAT framework. Meanwhile, the information model can be reused in future specifications to provide additional serializations, for example using ASN.1.</t>
