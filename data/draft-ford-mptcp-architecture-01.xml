      <t>Often endpoints are connected by multiple paths, but the nature ofTCP/IP restricts communications to a single path per socket.Resource usage within the network would be more efficient were thesemultiple paths able to be used concurrently. This should enhanceuser experience through improved resilience to network failure andhigher throughput.This document outlines architectural guidelines for the developmentof a Multipath Transport Protocol, with references to how thesearchitectural components come together in the Multipath TCP (MPTCP)protocol. This document also lists certain high level designdecisions that provide foundations for the MPTCP design, based uponthese architectural requirements.</t>
