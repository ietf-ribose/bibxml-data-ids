      <t>At the 67th San Diego IETF Meeting it is anticipated that the Real-time Applications and Infrastructure Area will meet and its ongoing work program will be an item for discussion. This Internet Draft has been prepared to share the relevant portions of the PTSC current work program with the IETF. It is hoped that awareness of the Packet Technologies Systems Committee (PTSC) work program will allow for more informed discussion.</t>
