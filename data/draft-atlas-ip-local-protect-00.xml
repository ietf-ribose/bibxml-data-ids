      <t>This document defines an architecture and selection process forproviding local protection for IP unicast and/or LDP traffic in theevent of a single link or node failure until the router hasconverged. When computing the primary next-hop for a prefix, arouter S also determines an alternate next-hop which can be used ifthe primary next-hop fails. The alternate can be either a loop-freealternate, which goes to a neighbor whose shortest path to the prefixdoes not go back through the router S, or a U-turn alternate, whichgoes to a neighbor whose primary next-hop to the prefix is the routerS, and which has itself a loop-free node-protecting alternate, whichthus does not go through router S to reach the destination prefix.</t>
