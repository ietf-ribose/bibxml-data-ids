      <t>Alternative Best-Effort (ABE) is a novel service for IP networks. Itoffers applications the choice between receiving a lower end-to-enddelay and receiving more overall throughput. Every best effort packetis tagged as either green or blue. Green packets receive a low, bounded queueing delay. To ensure blue packets do not suffer as aresult, green flows receive less throughput during bouts ofcongestion.</t>
