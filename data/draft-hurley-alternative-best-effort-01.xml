      <t>Alternative Best-Effort (ABE) is a novel service for IP networks. It offers applications the choice between receiving a lower end-to-end delay and receiving more overall throughput. Every best effort packet is tagged as either green or blue. Green packets receive a low, bounded queueing delay. To ensure blue packets do not suffer as a result, green flows receive less throughput during bouts of congestion.</t>
