      <t>This document is a type of FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) for new STIR Working Group participants. Since its inception three months ago there have been over 1,500 emails on the mailing list, before the WG was even formed. Some of the emails repeat topics, because newcomers cannot be expected to read all previous emails in the archive. This document is an attempt to capture some of the previously asked and answered questions. This document is written by one individual, is not intended to be published as an RFC, and is only meant as a temporary FAQ while the Working Group begins. The document attempts to provide both high- level information for non-experts, as well as low-level information for protocol experts.</t>
