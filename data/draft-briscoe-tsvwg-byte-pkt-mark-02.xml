      <t>This memo concerns dropping or marking packets using active queuemanagement (AQM) such as random early detection (RED) or pre-congestion notification (PCN). The primary conclusion is that packetsize should be taken into account when transports decode congestionindications, not when network equipment writes them. Reducing dropof small packets has some tempting advantages: i) it drops lesscontrol packets, which tend to be small and ii) it makes TCP's bit-rate less dependent on packet size. However, there are ways ofaddressing these issues at the transport layer, rather than reverseengineering network forwarding to fix specific transport problems.Network layer algorithms like the byte-mode packet drop variant ofRED should not be used to drop fewer small packets, because thatcreates a perverse incentive for transports to use tiny segments,consequently also opening up a DoS vulnerability.</t>
