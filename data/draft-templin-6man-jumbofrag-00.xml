      <t>Internet Protocol, Version 6 (IPv6) provides a service for transmission of IPv6 packets larger than 65,535 octets known as "jumbograms". Such large packets are not eligible for fragmentation, and the current specification forbids the inclusion of a fragment header of any kind. However, some implementations may wish to include an Identification value with each jumbogram; hence this document proposes the transmission of IPv6 jumbograms as "atomic fragments".</t>
