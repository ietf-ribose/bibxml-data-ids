      <t>This document addresses a network side solution of fast handover in Mobile IPv6. Existing FMIPv6 basically assumes the involvement of mobile nodes in handover procedure. However, in some cases, it may not be easy to realize fast handover function into all mobile nodes. In the case, a network operator may want to provide fast handover service to users by using only networks entities. To achieve network side fast handover, this document basically uses bi-directional tunnel between a previous access router and new access router. The proposed fast handover scheme has simpler procedure than the existing FMIPv6 and mostly uses the existing messages.</t>
