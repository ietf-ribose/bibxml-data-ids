      <t>This document describes the mechanism for providing the host configuration parameters needed for network service from home network based on DHCPINFORM. DHCPINFORM message has been widely used by client to obtain other configuration information and could be sent to local broadcast address or server unicast address. Mobile IP specification could support DHCPINFORM broadcast or unicast message straightfully without any revision.</t>
