      <t>This proposal describes proposed language for the 822bis draft, draft-ietf-drums-msg-fmt-03.txt, that clarifies the semantics of the Reply-To header. The intention is to clarify the rather vague language in 822bis in a way which preserves compatibility with the largest possible subset of existing mail user agents. This document should be read in conjunction with Jacob Palme's Mail-Followup-To proposal (draft-ietf-drums-mail-followup-to-00.txt), which the working group chair, Jacob Palme and the author regard as a natural complement of this proposal.</t>
