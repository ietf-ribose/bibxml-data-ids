      <t>This document specifies a Mobile IPv4 extension that may be used by dual stack mobile nodes to obtain IPv6 service with the use of a Mobile IPv4 registration. This extension allows for immediate deployment of IPv6 on dual stack mobile devices, without the need for a full IPv6 infrastructure. It is believed that providing IPv6 services to mobile devices in the short term will spur the growth of IPv6 networks. This extension makes use of the existing Mobile IPv4 security model, including the interface to the AAA infrastructure, but does not provide the route optimization capabilities included in the Mobile IPv6 protocol. Further, this specification requires that the mobile node and Home Agent have dual IPv4 and IPv6 stacks. There are no changes to the FA nor does it need to be dual stack.</t>
