      <t>The IETF Network Virtualization Overlays (NVO3) Working Group Chairs and Routing Area Director chartered a design team to take forward the encapsulation discussion and see if there was potential to design a common encapsulation that addresses the various technical concerns. This document provides a record, for the benefit of the IETF community, of the considerations arrived at by the NVO3 encapsulation design team, which may be helpful with future deliberations by working groups over the choice of encapsulation formats. There are implications of having different encapsulations in real environments consisting of both software and hardware implementations and within and spanning multiple data centers. For example, OAM functions such as path MTU discovery become challenging with multiple encapsulations along the data path. The design team recommended Geneve with a few modifications as the common encapsulation. This document provides more details, particularly in Section 7.</t>
