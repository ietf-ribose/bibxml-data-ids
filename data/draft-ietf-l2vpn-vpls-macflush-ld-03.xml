      <t>MAC Address Withdrawal is a mechanism described in [RFC4762] to remove or unlearn MAC addresses that have been dynamically learned in a VPLS instance, for faster convergence on topology change. Failure of mechanisms that control loop free connectivity among VPLS PE-rs nodes may cause MAC Address Withdrawal messages looping among those nodes, leading to Denial of Service (DoS) or complete failure of control plane in the PE-rs nodes. This document describes a mechanism to detect and prevent loops of MAC Address Withdrawal messages in a VPLS PE-rs node on such failures.</t>
