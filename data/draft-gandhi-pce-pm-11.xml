    <abstract>
      <t>In certain networks, network performance data such as packet loss, delay, and delay variation, as well as bandwidth utilization, are critical measures for Traffic Engineering (TE). These data provide operators with the characteristics of their networks for the performance evaluation required to ensure the Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients' (PCCs') requests. The Stateful PCE extensions allow stateful control of Traffic Engineering LSPs for Segment Routing (SR) and RSVP using PCEP. This document describes PCEP extensions for enabling and reporting end-to-end performance measurements and liveness detection for both PCE-Initiated and PCC-Initiated LSPs for SR-TE over MPLS and IPv6 data planes and MPLS-TE to an Active Stateful PCE.</t>
