      <t>There is a great deal of concern over the security of routing systemswithin the Internet, particularly in relation to the Border GatewayProtocol [BGP], which is used to provide routing information betweenautonomous systems. This draft addresses various deployment scenariosand options using the extensions to BGP outlined in [SOBGP-BGP] inconjunction with [SOBGP-KEY] (which is not yet completed orpublished) and [SOBGP-RADIUS]. Each section of this draft discusses adifferent deployment situation or deployment option. The finalsection discusses how private key rollovers can be accomplished withno loss of routing information within soBGP deployments.</t>
