      <t>There is a great deal of concern over the security of routing systems within the Internet, particularly in relation to the Border Gateway Protocol [BGP], which is used to provide routing information between autonomous systems. This draft addresses various deployment scenarios and options using the extensions to BGP outlined in [SOBGP-BGP] in conjunction with [SOBGP-KEY] (which is not yet completed or published) and [SOBGP-RADIUS]. Each section of this draft discusses a different deployment situation or deployment option. The final section discusses how private key rollovers can be accomplished with no loss of routing information within soBGP deployments.</t>
