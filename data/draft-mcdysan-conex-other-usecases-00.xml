      <t>This draft proposes some use cases for inclusion in the conex Working group charter's deliverable for an informational RFC covering use case description. These use cases are in addition to and/or complement those described in [UseCases], and focus on forms of congestion exposure that involve resources other than queues and timeframes other than real-time.</t>
