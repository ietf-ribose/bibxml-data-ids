      <t>Many home user networks or enterprise networks are using the addresstranslation technology (NAT[1]) at the boundary of their end-networksfor various reasons.One disadvantage of the use of the address translation technology isthat it might disable two-way transparent communication.This document specifies the enhancement of the address translationtechnology, which it adds 'sub-address' to current IP address space toenable NAT inside/outside hosts to setup transparent communication inboth direction through enhanced NAT routers.This enhancement is called 'C-NATS' (Capsulated Network AddressTranslation with Sub-Address) and the word 'NATS' used in thisdocument implies 'C-NATS'.</t>
