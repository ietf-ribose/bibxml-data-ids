      <t>Many home user networks or enterprise networks are using the address translation technology (NAT[1]) at the boundary of their end-networks for various reasons. One disadvantage of the use of the address translation technology is that it might disable two-way transparent communication. This document specifies the enhancement of the address translation technology, which it adds 'sub-address' to current IP address space to enable NAT inside/outside hosts to setup transparent communication in both direction through enhanced NAT routers. This enhancement is called 'C-NATS' (Capsulated Network Address Translation with Sub-Address) and the word 'NATS' used in this document implies 'C-NATS'.</t>
