      <t>In order to guarantee the security and integration of the subscriber in WLAN network, Pairwise Master Key (PMK) will be generated as an access authorization token during the mutual authentication procedure between station (STA) and authenticator server (AS). Then, the PMK and 4-way handshake are used between STA and Authenticator to derive, bind and verify the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK), which is a collection of operational keys for security. Also,Group Transient Key (GTK) can be derived, and is used to secure multicast/broadcast traffic. In the authentication architecture, only STA and AS can manufacture PMK, moreover, AS can only distribute PMK to Authenticator.However, if the authenticator function is not collocated with the encryption/decryption function, it is difficult to achieve traffic encryption/decryption in WLAN network.The purpose of this document is to analyze the requirement and issue for key management that have arisen so far during STA authentication process in WLAN network. Meanwhile, the control messages for key management are defined.</t>
