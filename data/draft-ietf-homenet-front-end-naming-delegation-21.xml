    <abstract>
      <t>Home network owners may have devices or services hosted on this home network that they wish to access from the Internet (i.e., from a network outside of the home network). To enable this access, the names and IP addresses of these devices and services needs to be made available in the public DNS. The names and IP address of the home network are present in the Public Homenet Zone by the Homenet Naming Authority (HNA), which in turn instructs the DNS Outsourcing Infrastructure (DOI) to publish the zone on the behalf of the HNA. This document describes how an HNA can instruct a DOI to publish a Public Homenet Zone on its behalf.</t>
