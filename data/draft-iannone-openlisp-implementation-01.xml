      <t>The RRG is working on the design of an alternate Internet Architecture in order solve issues of the current architecture related to scalability, mobility, multi-homing, and inter-domain routing. Among the various proposals, LISP (Locator/ID Separation Protocol) is one of the most advanced. The present draft describes the overall architecture of OpenLISP, an open source implementation of the LISP proposal.
