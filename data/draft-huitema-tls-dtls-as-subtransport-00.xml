      <t>The developers of "user level" transports will benefit from a standard implementation of authentication and encryption. This can be achieved using DTLS as a sub-transport. Using DTLS enables developers to benefit from the investment in TLS, and removes the burden and the risks of re-creating similar technology. There are several requirements to ensure that DTLS is a suitable sub- transport: zero RTT setup, low overhead, and DOS prevention. The IAB SEMI workshop outlined other potential requirements: start/stop indication, and ability to accept indications from the network. The draft presents guidelines for meeting these requirements in a new version of DTLS.</t>
