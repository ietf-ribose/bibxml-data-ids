      <t>The IETF TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links) protocol provides least cost pair-wise data forwarding without configuration in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topologies and link technologies. TRILL supports for multi-pathing of both unicast and multicast traffic. Devices that implement the TRILL protocol are called RBridges (Routing Bridges) or TRILL Switches. The ESADI (End Station Address Distribution Information) protocol is a VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) scoped way that TRILL switches can communicate end station addresses to each other. An RBridge announcing VLAN-x connectivity (normally a VLAN-x appointed forwarder) and running the TRILL ESADI protocol can receive remote address information and/or transmit local address information for VLAN-x to other such RBridges. This document updates RFC 6325, specifically the documentation of the ESADI protocol.</t>
