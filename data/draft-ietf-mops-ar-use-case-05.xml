      <t>This document explores the issues involved in the use of Edge Computing resources to operationalize media use cases that involve Extended Reality (XR) applications. In particular, we discuss those applications that run on devices having different form factors and need Edge computing resources to mitigate the effect of problems such as a need to support interactive communication requiring low latency, limited battery power, and heat dissipation from those devices. The intended audience for this document are network operators who are interested in providing edge computing resources to operationalize the requirements of such applications. We discuss the expected behavior of XR applications which can be used to manage the traffic. In addition, we discuss the service requirements of XR applications to be able to run on the network.</t>
