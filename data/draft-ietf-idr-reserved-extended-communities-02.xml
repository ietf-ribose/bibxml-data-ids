      <t>This document defines two IANA registries in order to assign transitive and non-transitive extended communities from. These are similar to the existing well-known BGP communities defined in RFC 1997 but provide an easier control of inter-AS community advertisement as a community could be chosen as transitive or non- transitive across ASes. For that purpose, this document defines the use of the reserved AS number 0 for the transitive and non-transitive generic four-octet AS specific extended community types.</t>
