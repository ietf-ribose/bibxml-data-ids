      <t>This memorandum describes how the HIP control packets can be used to send requests for preferred certificates to the correspondent hosts, and also requests for a Certification Authority (CA) to issue a certificate. The document specifies two new HIP parameters CERT_REQ and CERT_SIGN_REQ and describes their use. The means as to how to signal an error in case of the desired certificate is not available is also discussed. The syntax of certificates and certificate requests is out of scope of the document and defined elsewhere.</t>
