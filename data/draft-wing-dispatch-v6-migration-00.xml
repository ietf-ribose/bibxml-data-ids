      <t>During the migration from IPv4 to IPv6, it is anticipated that anIPv6 path might be broken for a variety of reasons, causing endpointsto not receive RTP data. Connectivity checks would detect and avoidthe user noticing such a problem, but there is industry reluctance toimplement connectivity checks.This document describes a mechanism allowing dual-stack SIP endpointsto attempt communications over IPv6 and fall back to IPv4 if the IPv6path is not working. The mechanism does not require connectivitychecks.</t>
