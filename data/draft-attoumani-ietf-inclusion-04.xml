      <t>This document aims to foster a deeper reflection within the IETF community on inclusive participation, equitable access, and the implications of global meeting venue selections on diverse contributors. It seeks to complement existing RFCs by proposing additional dialogue, tools, and evaluation mechanisms, while also highlighting the shared responsibility of underrepresented regions in mobilizing local stakeholders to engage with the IETF. This draft includes concrete proposals, metrics, and an implementation roadmap to move from discussion to action.</t>
