      <t>[MLDP] describes extensions to the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) for setup of point to multi-point (P2MP) and multipoint-to-multipoint (MP2MP) Label Switched Paths (LSPs). LDP forwarding equivalence class (FEC) elements used to establish P2MP and MP2MP LSPs include type- length-value (TLV) fields that carry information meaningful to Ingress LSRs and Leaf LSRs and are termed as Opaque Value Elements in [MLDP]. This document defines Opaque Value Element structure to be used for provisioning P2MP and MP2MP Provider tunnels (P-Tunnels) for Multicast Virtual Private Network (MVPN). It is envisioned that this would be useful for security and manageability of P-Tunnels used for MVPN from the ones provisioned for other applications and vice-versa.</t>
