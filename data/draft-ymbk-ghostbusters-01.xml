      <t>In the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), resource certificates completely obscure names or any other information which might be useful for contacting responsible parties to deal with issues of certificate expiration, maintenance, roll-overs, compromises, etc. This draft describes the RPKI Ghostbusters Record containing human contact information to be signed (indirectly) by a resource-owning certificate. The data in the record are those of a severely profiled vCARD.</t>
