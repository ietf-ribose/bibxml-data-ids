      <t>The IMAP4 specification allows the searching only of the selectedmailbox. A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and aclient that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT andSEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete before moving on to thenext. This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxeswith one command, limiting the round-trips and waiting for varioussearches to complete. This also introduces mailbox field in ESEARCHresponses, allowing a client to pipeline the searches if it chooses.NoteA revised version of this draft document will be submitted to the RFCeditor as a Proposed Standard for the Internet Community. Discussionand suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent toietf-imapext@imc.org.</t>
