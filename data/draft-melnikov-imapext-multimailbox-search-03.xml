    <abstract>
      <t>The IMAP4 specification allows the searching only of the selected mailbox. A user often wants to search multiple mailboxes, and a client that wishes to support this must issue a series of SELECT and SEARCH commands, waiting for each to complete before moving on to the next. This extension allows a client to search multiple mailboxes with one command, limiting the round-trips and waiting for various searches to complete. This also introduces mailbox field in ESEARCH responses, allowing a client to pipeline the searches if it chooses.Note A revised version of this draft document will be submitted to the RFC editor as a Proposed Standard for the Internet Community. Discussion and suggestions for improvement are requested, and should be sent to ietf-imapext@imc.org.</t>
