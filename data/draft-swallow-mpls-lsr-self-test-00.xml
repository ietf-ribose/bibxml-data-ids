      <t>This document defines a means of self test for a Label-Switched Router (LSR) to verify that its dataplane is functioning for certain key Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) applications including unicast forwarding based on LDP [LDP] and traffic engineering tunnels based on [RSVP-TE]. A new Loopback FEC type is defined to allow an upstream neighbor to assist in the testing at very low cost. MPLS Echo Request and MPLS Echo Reply messages [LSP-Ping] messages are extended to do the actually probing.</t>
