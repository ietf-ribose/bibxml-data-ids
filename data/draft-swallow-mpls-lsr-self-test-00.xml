      <t>This document defines a means of self test for a Label-SwitchedRouter (LSR) to verify that its dataplane is functioning for certainkey Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) applications includingunicast forwarding based on LDP [LDP] and traffic engineering tunnelsbased on [RSVP-TE]. A new Loopback FEC type is defined to allow anupstream neighbor to assist in the testing at very low cost. MPLSEcho Request and MPLS Echo Reply messages [LSP-Ping] messages areextended to do the actually probing.</t>
