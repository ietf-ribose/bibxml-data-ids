      <t>In SIP-based networks, a SIP session MAY involve several application servers on the originating and terminating side. In a certain case, an application server needs to set some indications in SIP message to indicate service information (what are invoked, what can be allowed and what should blocked). This kind of information will be also required for composition of SIP applications. There is a need to provide indicators for service interaction between SIP application servers or other SIP endpoints. This document describes a mechanism of service interaction indicator for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that enhances service interaction between SIP application servers in a trusted network.</t>
