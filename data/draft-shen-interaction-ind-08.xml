      <t>In SIP-based networks, a SIP session MAY involve several applicationservers on the originating and terminating side. In a certain case,an application server needs to set some indications in SIP message toindicate service information (what are invoked, what can be allowedand what should blocked). This kind of information will be alsorequired for composition of SIP applications. There is a need toprovide indicators for service interaction between SIP applicationservers or other SIP endpoints.This document describes a mechanism of service interaction indicatorfor the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) that enhances serviceinteraction between SIP application servers in a trusted network.</t>
