      <t>Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) provides only limited space for communicating diagnostic information when errors occur. To facilitate troubleshooting, automated error detection, and reporting we propose to create new protocol extensions. The extensions will be used for richer reporting on request processing status. Particularly, we suggest that User Agent Servers (UAS) include additional information about error reasons in negative replies, and proxy servers indicate in relayed requests the routing logic they used.</t>
