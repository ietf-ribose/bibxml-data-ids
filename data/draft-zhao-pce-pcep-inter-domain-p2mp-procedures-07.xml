      <t>The ability to compute paths for constrained point-to-multipoint(P2MP) Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) acrossmultiple domains has been identified as a key requirement for thedeployment of P2MP services in MPLS and GMPLS networks. The PathComputation Element (PCE) has been recognized as an appropriatetechnology for the determination of inter-domain paths of P2MP TELSPs.This document describes the procedures and extensions to the PCEcommunication Protocol (PCEP) to handle requests and responses forthe computation of inter-domain paths for P2MP TE LSPs.</t>
