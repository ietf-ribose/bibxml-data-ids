      <t>The deployment and provisioning of multicast services must satisfy certain network design constraints in the last mile. It is common for a network design to have a small set of intelligent layer 3 devices (controllers) and a larger set of simpler layer 2 devices (aggregators). The controllers handle routing, user authentication and access control etc. They are connected via a network to the aggregators closer to the clients. Special design is needed to support multicast over this network. This draft proposes a Remote Multicast Replication (RMR) protocol, that reduces or removes duplicate multicast traffic in between the controllers and the aggregators. The RMR protocol is independent of layer 2 technology and topology being used.</t>
