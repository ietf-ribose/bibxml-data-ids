      <t>The deployment and provisioning of multicast services must satisfycertain network design constraints in the last mile. It is commonfor a network design to have a small set of intelligent layer 3devices (controllers) and a larger set of simpler layer 2 devices(aggregators). The controllers handle routing, user authenticationand access control etc. They are connected via a network to theaggregators closer to the clients. Special design is needed tosupport multicast over this network.This draft proposes a Remote Multicast Replication (RMR) protocol,that reduces or removes duplicate multicast traffic in between thecontrollers and the aggregators. The RMR protocol is independentof layer 2 technology and topology being used.</t>
