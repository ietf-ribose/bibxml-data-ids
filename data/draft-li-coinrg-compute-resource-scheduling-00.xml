      <t>With massive data growing in the internet, how to effectively use the compute resources has become a quite hot topic. In order to cool down the pressure in today's large data centers, some compute resources have been moved towards the edge, gradually forming a distributed Compute Force Network. Force is a physical cause which can change the state of a motion or an object. We refer the definition from physics and extend its philosophy to network that in future, the network can be a compute force which can facilitate the integration of different kinds of compute resources, no matter hardware or software, making the computation fast and effective. In this draft, we present a compute resources oriented scheduling mechanism based on dataplane programmability, which can effectively schedule and manage compute resources in the network.</t>
