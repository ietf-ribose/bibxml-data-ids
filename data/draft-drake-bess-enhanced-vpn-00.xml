    <abstract>
      <t>Future networks that support advanced services, such as those enabled by 5G mobile networks, envisions a set of overlay networks each with different performance and scaling properties. These overlays are known as network slices and are realized over a common underlay network. In order to support network slicing, as well as to offer enhanced VPN services in general, it is necessary to define a mechanism by which specific resources (links and/or nodes) of an underlay network can be used by a specific network slice, VPN, or set of VPNs. This document sets out such a mechanism for use in Segment Routing networks.</t>
