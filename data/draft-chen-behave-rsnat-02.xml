      <t>For the rapid exhaustion of IPv4 address pool against the slowdevelopment of IPv6, IPv4/IPv6 co-existence/transition would be along period. In the IPv4/IPv6 transition process, there are manyNAT- like technologies active in the internet. However, the NATboxes such as IPv4 NAT, IPv4/IPv6 NAT are so poor in theirreliability and scalability, which put a severe threat on thedevelopment of IPv4/IPv6 transition. This document defines areliable and scalable NAT (RS- NAT) mechanism to solve the problem.</t>
