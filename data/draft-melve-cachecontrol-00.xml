      <t>User agents such as caches and web indexers, which act on behalf of more than one user are often given access to documents which are restricted by IP address or domain. These agents then republish this information to users outside the allowed block, as there is currently no means of marking these objects with their access restrictions. This document details an extension to the Cache-control header in HTTP/1.1 [HTTP/1.1] to add information about IP or domain based access restrictions. It also stresses that Cache-control should apply to all User-agents which work on behalf on a number of users, and not just to caches.</t>
