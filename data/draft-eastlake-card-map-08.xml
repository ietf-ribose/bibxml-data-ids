      <t>There are a variety of servers, web pages, and the like, which holders of ISO 7812 financial transaction identification card (i.e., credit/debit card) numbers and ISO 7816 smart card or related numbers may need to locate on the Internet. For example, some systems assume a smart card holder can contact the issuer of a smart card application for maintenance and update functions and the payment protocols may assume that a card holder can locate the appropriate certification authority to obtain a card holder certificate. This document specifies a method using the DNS as an important element in locating card related facilities on the Internet by mapping ISO 7812 and ISO 7816 number systems into domain names.</t>
