      <t>The Internet Core needs to be expandable to allow it to be usable on low-end devices with poor connectivity to be able to access internet resources in a seamless way on the application layer. this concept suggests that one way of how that can happen is through the stacking and unstacking of bits on the physical and datalink layers. Bycntainerising the input bytes into a bundle of 103bits and unstaking them on the other end of the communication layer using a different way f arrangement and encoding that can be interpreted by another protocol on the network layer. this can run parallel to the existing internet protocols and frameworks on the physical ,datalink and network layers</t>
