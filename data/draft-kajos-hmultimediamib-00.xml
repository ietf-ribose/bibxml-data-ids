      <t>This Recommendation describes the Multimedia Management Information Base for H.323 and H.320 Multimedia Terminals. The purpose of HMultimediaMIB is to standardize the management information in multimedia conferencing systems based on one of more of the ITU-T H-series recommendations. The goal of Multimedia Management is to provide the appropriate level of management support for the particular Multimedia device. Multimedia management must permit the resources that are being used by individual Multimedia sessions to be identified for the purposes of fault detection, fault isolation, performance monitoring, configuration management, and capacity analyses. Multimedia management is applicable to both intermediate-system as well as end-system Multimedia devices such as terminals, multipoint control units (MCUs), gatekeepers, and gateways.</t>
