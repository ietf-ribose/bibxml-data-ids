      <t>In an era where AI-generated content has become indistinguishable from human writing, the Human-Generated Content Protocol (HGCP) proposes a voluntary signing framework that enables human authors to take responsibility for their expressions. Instead of relying on probabilistic detection methods or enforcing centralized identity, HGCP encourages a simple yet powerful act: a signer publicly declares responsibility for authored content through a structured signature block. The protocol is platform-neutral, supports both real-name and anonymous identities, and prioritizes transparency, accountability, and human agency. HGCP defines minimal signature structures, integration suggestions for platforms and tools, and philosophical guidance for fostering expression trust in an increasingly synthetic information ecosystem.</t>
