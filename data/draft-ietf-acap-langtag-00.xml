      <t>For various computing applications, it is helpful to know the language of the text being processed. This can be the case even if otherwise only pure character sequences (so-called plain text) are handled. From several sides, the need for such a scheme for ACAP has been claimed. One specific scheme, called MLSF, has also been proposed, see draft-ietf-acap-mlsf-01.txt for details. This document proposes two alternatives to MLSF. One alternative is using text/enriched-like markup. The second alternative is using a special tag-introduction character. Advantages and disadvantages of the various proposals are discussed. Some general comments about the topic of language tagging are given in the introduction.</t>
