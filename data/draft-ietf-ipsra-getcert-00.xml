      <t>IKE was designed for use with certificates. In a remote accessscenario, that implies that clients must possess their owncertificates. We leverage off of work already done to fast-startcertificate use with IPsec via the Simple Certificate EnrollmentProtocol [SCEP]. We use only parts of SCEP over a clientauthenticated TLS/HTTP connection to a CA. By using TLS, the clientcan trust a CA root certificate it receives, without an out-of-bandverification and the CA can perform automatic enrollment. We replacethe out-of-band client identification process for a certificateenrollment with a legacy authentication, like RADIUS. Further, sincethe certificates issued here are short-lived, there is no need tosupport client-based revocation or rekeying. Also, there istypically no need for CRL support.</t>
