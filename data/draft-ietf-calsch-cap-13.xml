      <t>The Calendar Access Protocol (CAP) is an Internet protocol described in this memo that permits a Calendar User (CU) to utilize a Calendar User Agent (CUA) to access an [iCAL] based Calendar Store (CS). The CAP definition is based on requirements identified by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) Calendaring and Scheduling (CALSCH) Working Group. More information about the IETF CALSCH Working Group activities can be found on the IMC web site at http:// www.imc.org/ietf-calendar and at the IETF web site at http:// www.ietf.org/html.charters/calsch-charter.html [1]. Refer to the references within this memo for further information on how to access these various documents.</t>
