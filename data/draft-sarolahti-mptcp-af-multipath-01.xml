      <t>This document specifies a new address family to be used for socketsthat are bound to more than one IP address, as motivated by theMultipath TCP work in the IETF. The goal is to use the same set offunction calls as traditionally, but by new address family make itpossible for them to express multiple addresses to connect or bindto. The document gives a high-level definition of the behavior ofthe traditional function calls, but a detailed specification of theAPI syntax is not in the scope of this document.</t>
