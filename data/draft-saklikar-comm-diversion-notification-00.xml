      <t>This draft defines a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Notification Framework-based mechanism for notifying Users about diversions (re-directions or forwarding) of their incoming communication sessions. A new event package is proposed for allowing users to subscribe for and receive such notifications. Users have further capability to define filters controlling the selection, rate and content of such notifications. The applicability of this event package includes 3GPP IMS.</t>
