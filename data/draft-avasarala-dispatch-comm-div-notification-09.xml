    <abstract>
      <t>3GPP and TISPAN are defining the protocol specification for the Communication Diversion (CDIV) service using IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem supplementary service. As part of CDIV, a SIP based Event package framework is used for notifying users about diversions (re-directions or forwarding) of their incoming communication sessions. This document proposes a new SIP event package for allowing users to subscribe to and receive such notifications. Users can further define filters to control the rate and content of such notifications. The proposed event package is applicable to the CDIV supplementary service in IMS and may not be applicable to the general internet. .</t>
