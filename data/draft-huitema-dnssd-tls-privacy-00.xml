    <abstract>
      <t>DNS-SD (DNS Service Discovery) normally discloses information about both the devices offering services and the devices requesting services. This information includes host names, network parameters, and possibly a further description of the corresponding service instance. Especially when mobile devices engage in DNS Service Discovery over Multicast DNS at a public hotspot, a serious privacy problem arises. We propose to solve this problem by developing a private discovery profile for UDP based transports using TLS, such as DTLS and QUIC. The profile is based on using the Encrypted SNI extension. We also define a standalone private discovery service, that can be combined with arbitrary applications in the same way as DNS-SD.</t>
