      <t>This draft is intended to be a proposal for updating the current 'RIP version 2' RFC [1]. This necessity is due to a difference of behaviour between the RIP protocol as described in [1] and the RIP protocol as implemented by many vendors. If all the vendors apply the same rule, no problem arises. But, on the contrary, serious problems of interoperability can occur. With some little changes in the text, this draft can be used as the new 'RIP version 2' RFC. People just interested in the implementing protocols may simply go to paragraph 8 (Changing the current RFC) and skip all the others. The purpose of all the other paragraphs is to support the idea of changing the RFC.</t>
