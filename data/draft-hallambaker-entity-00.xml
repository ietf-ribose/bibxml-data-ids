      <t>This document describes a set of related protocol extensions to S/MIME, SMTP and DNS that collectively simplify deployment of S/MIME. Particular attention is given to ensuring that S/MIME authenticated content is only received by end user clients capable of presenting the content in an acceptable manner. The proposal extends the ‘end-to-end’ security model of traditional S/MIME to support end-to-edge, edge-to-end and edge-to-edge use cases.</t>
