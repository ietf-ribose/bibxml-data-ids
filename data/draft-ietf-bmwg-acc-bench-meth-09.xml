      <t>Routers in an operational network are configured with multiple protocols and security policies while simultaneously forwarding traffic and being managed. To accurately benchmark a router for deployment it is necessary to test the router in a lab environment under accelerated conditions, which is known as Stress Testing. This document provides the Methodology Guidelines for performing Accelerated Stress Benchmarking of networking devices. The methodology is to be used with the companion terminology document [4]. These guidelines can be used as the basis for additional methodology documents that benchmark stress conditions for specific network technologies. for Accelerated Stress Benchmarking</t>
