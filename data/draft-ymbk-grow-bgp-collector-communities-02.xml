      <t>When BGP route collectors such as RIPE RIS and Route Views are used by operators and researchers, currently one can not tell if the collection of paths announced to a collector represents the ISP's customer cone, includes internal routes, includes paths learned from peerings or transits. This greatly reduces the utility of the collected data. This document specifies the use of BGP communities to differentiate the kinds of views being presented to the collectors.</t>
