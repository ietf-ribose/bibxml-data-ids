      <t>SMTP was designed simply to deliver email messages without authenticating sources or senders of email messages. In an affort to reduce spam on the Internet, Challenge/Response ('C/R') email systems were developed to provide a method for validating message origination for an intended recipient. This document defines a Challenge / Response Interworking ('CRI') protocol by proposing the use of SMTP extensions and MIME headers for interoperability of C/R systems. This document also defines a set of guidelines for continued use with existing non-CRI mail systems and clients.</t>
