      <t>This document proposes a standardized set of API endpoints for securely changing user passwords, using a unique identifier prefix to ensure compatibility and avoid conflicts with other APIs. As the number of online accounts continues to grow, managing passwords has become increasingly challenging. Even with the use of password managers, the process of updating passwords-whether due to a security breach, expiration, or other reasons-remains a time-consuming and manual task. Currently, there is no standardized method for performing password changes across various platforms, which further complicates this process. The goal of this proposal is to establish a universal standard for password change processes, enabling password managers and services to automate password updates with minimal configuration, thereby reducing the burden on users and improving overall security.</t>
