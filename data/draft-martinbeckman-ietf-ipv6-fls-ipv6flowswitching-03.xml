      <t>This document seeks to establish a standard for the utilization of the Class of Service Field and the us of the Flow Label Field within the IPv6 Header and establish a methodology of switching packets through routers using the first 32-bits of the IPv6 header using Flow Label Switching on packets rather than full routing of packets. Within the first 32-bits of an IPv6 header exists the requisite information to allow for the immediate “switching” on an ingress packet of a router, allowing for “Label Switching” of a native IPv6 packet. This allows the establishment of VPN circuits in a dynamic manner across transit networks. The establishment of “Flows” based upon the 20-bit “Flow Label” value can be done dynamically with minimal effort and configuration of the end-point routers of the flow. The flows can be managed or open, encrypted or in the clear, and will allow for greater scalability, security, and agility in the management and operation of networks.</t>
