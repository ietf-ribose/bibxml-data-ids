      <t>Recent discussions on the need to translate or not between IPv4 andIPv6 have brought a better understanding on the impact of tools likeNAT-PT [NAT-PT]. Several problems have been identified around theDNS ALG functionality. An alternative solution that does not requirethis DNS ALG for connections initiated by the IPv6 side has beenproposed. This memo aims at analyzing the pros and cons of bothsolutions in that case. Connections initiated by the IPv4 side wouldalways require the help of a DNS-ALG and thus are not covered by thismemo.</t>
