      <t>Some networks, such as in space, have links that are up and down based on a known schedule. In this context, IP Packets or Bundle Protocol Bundles should then be saved locally until the destination becomes reachable again. This document describes forwarding node policies regarding how to manage the local store as well as forwarding decisions. This specification applies to both IP packets or Bundle Protocol bundles.</t>
