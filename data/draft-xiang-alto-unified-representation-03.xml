    <abstract>
      <t>The ALTO protocol [RFC7285] provides network information to applications so that applications can make network informed decisions to improve the performance. However, the base ALTO protocol only provides coarse-grained end-to-end metrics, which are insufficient to satisfy the demands of applications to solve more complex network optimization problems. The ALTO Path Vector extension [DRAFT-PV] has been introduced to allow ALTO clients to query information such as capacity regions for a given set of flows. However, the current design of this extension has a limited expressiveness. The goal of this document is to introduce a unified resource representation service as an extension of ALTO (ALTO-UR), which allows the ALTO clients to query and get the capacity regions of more complex resource information, such as Shared-Risk-Link-Group (SRLG), multi- path routing, multicast and on-demand routing, for a given set of flows.</t>
