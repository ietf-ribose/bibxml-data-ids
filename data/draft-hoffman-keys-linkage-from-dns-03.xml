      <t>TLS and DTLS use certificates for authenticating the server. Userswant their applications to verify that the certificate provided bythe TLS server is in fact associated with the domain name theyexpect. Instead of trusting a certificate authority to have madethis association correctly, the user might instead trust theauthoritative DNS server for the domain name to make thatassociation. This document describes how to use secure DNS toassociate the TLS server's certificate with the the intended domainname.</t>
