      <t>When SIP entities use a connection oriented protocol to send arequest, they typically originate their connections from an ephemeralport. The SIP protocol includes mechanisms which insure thatresponses to a request, and new requests sent in the originaldirection reuse an existing connection. However, new requests sentin the opposite direction are unlikely to reuse the existingconnection. This frequently causes a pair of SIP entities to use oneconnection for requests sent in each direction, and can result inpotential scaling and performance problems. This document presentsrequirements for addressing this shortcoming, and separately proposesan example mechanism which addresses this deficiency.</t>
