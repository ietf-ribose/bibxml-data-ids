      <t>Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) improves destination privacy by encrypting the Server Name Indication in TLS, but the customer's source identity-- typically the IP address and network metadata-- remains observable to intermediaries such as CDNs, hosting providers, and recursive resolvers. This document introduces the _Customer- Facing Relay (CFR)_, a lightweight, transport-agnostic relay operated by access providers to decouple customer identity from encrypted destinations. By forwarding opaque encrypted payloads (TCP or UDP) without terminating TLS or QUIC, a CFR complements ECH encryption to strengthen source privacy and reduce metadata correlation.</t>
