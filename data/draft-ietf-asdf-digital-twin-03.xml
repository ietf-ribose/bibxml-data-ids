      <t>This memo specifies SDF modeling for a digital twin, i.e. a digital twin system, and its Things. An SDF is a format that is used to create and maintain data and interaction, and to represent the various kinds of data that is exchanged for these interactions. The SDF format can be used to model the characteristics, behavior and interactions of Things, i.e. physical objects, in a digital twin that contain Things as components.</t>
