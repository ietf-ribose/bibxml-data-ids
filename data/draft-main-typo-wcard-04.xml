      <t>Many Internet protocols have as an essential element a mapping from atextual name to some resource. There is a technique, popular in somecircles, of providing a default resource, which is returned inresponse to a lookup that does not match any known name, rather thanreturning an indication that there is no resource of that name. Thistechnique is dangerous and is to be discouraged in all contexts.This memo discusses the issues.</t>
