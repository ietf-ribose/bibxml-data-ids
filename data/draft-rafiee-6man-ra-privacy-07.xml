      <t>The purpose of this document is to address the privacy issues that exist within the Privacy Extension (RFC 44941) document so that the Privacy Extension document can then be updated to correct these shortcomings. These issues include the generation of public addresses based on EUI-64, not choosing a good randomized function, not changing the Interface ID (IID) when receiving a new router advertisement, and some wording issues that might be ambiguous in their interpretation.</t>
