      <t>In NVO3 networks, Network Virtualization Edge (NVE) devices sit at the edge of the underlay network and provide Layer-2 and Layer-3 connectivity among Tenant Systems (TSes) of the same tenant. The NVEs need to build and maintain mapping tables so that they can deliver encapsulated packets to their intended destination NVE(s). While there are different options to create and disseminate the mapping table entries, NVEs may exchange that information directly among themselves via a control-plane protocol, such as Ethernet Virtual Private Network (EVPN). EVPN provides an efficient, flexible and unified control-plane option that can be used for Layer-2 and Layer-3 Virtual Network (VN) service connectivity. This document describes the applicability of EVPN to NVO3 networks and how EVPN solves the challenges in those networks.</t>
