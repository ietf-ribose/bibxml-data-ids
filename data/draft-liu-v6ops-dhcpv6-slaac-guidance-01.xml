      <t>ND and DHCPv6 protocols could have some interaction on address provisioning with the A, M, and O flags defined in ND protocol. But the relevant standard definitions of the flags contain ambiguity, so that current implementations in operating systems have varied on interpreting the flags. The variation might impact real network operations, so this document aims to provide some operational guidance to eliminate the impact as much as possible.</t>
