      <t>This memo defines an extension to the SMTP (Simple Mail TransferProtocol) service whereby messages are sent with a priority toachieve a certain order in which the messages are transferred by anMTA (Message Transfer Agent). This priority or precedence order isused instead of the first-come-first-serve rule. This extension isnot to be confused with "Importance of a Message" which is widelydeployed using an email header such as Importance or even Priority orPrecedence with common values of HIGH, NORMAL and LOW. Importance ofa Message does not affect the priority of the transport itself in anyway. Nevertheless, there may be policy defined relations betweenpriorities and importance indicators.This extension uses the term priority in the meaning of expeditedtreatment of a message by the server according to its priority.</t>
