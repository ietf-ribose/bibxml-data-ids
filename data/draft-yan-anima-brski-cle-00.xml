      <t>Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI, RFC 8995) is an automated bootstrap protocol for unconfigured devices called "pledges". Existing enrollment protocols in BRSKI are all based on certificates, which are not suitable for constrained IoT devices. This document defines a certificateless enrollment protocol in BRSKI (BRSKI-CLE) for constrained IoT devices. To achieve a lightweight protocol, a credential based on public keys is designed to replace the domain certificate used in BRSKI. An authentication centre (AC) replaced the certification authority (CA) is used to issue the credential to the pledge. A new mutual authentication protocol is also designed to authenticate using the credentials.</t>
