      <t>This draft describes problems with IGP convergence time in some IPRAN networks that use a physical topology of grid backbones that connect rings of routers. Part of these IPRAN network topologies exist in data centers with sufficient power and interconnections, but some network equipment sits in remote sites impacted by power loss. In some geographic areas these remote sites may be subject to rolling blackouts. These rolling power blackouts could cause multiple simultaneous node and link failures. In these remote networks with blackouts, it is often critical that the IPRAN phone network re- converge quickly. The IGP running in these networks may run in a single level of the IGP. This document seeks to briefly describe these problems to determine if the emerging IGP technologies (flexible algorithms, dynamic flooding, layers of hierarchy in IGPs) can be applied to help reduce convergence times. It also seeks to determine if the improvements of these algorithms or the IP-Fast re-route algorithms are thwarted by the failure of multiple link and nodes.</t>
