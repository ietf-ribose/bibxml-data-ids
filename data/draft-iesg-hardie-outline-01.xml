    <abstract>
      <t>This outline contains a short description of the IETF's core work and a description of structures and processes which might be used to accomplish it. Many of the elements described are already in use either formally or informally. This document does, however, propose some new mechanisms to support the work of the IETF. The IESG does not believe that this document is complete, nor has it decided on a course of action based on this or any other proposal. The IESG does hope that presenting an outline set of mechanisms, both old and new, will foster discussion. The IESG hopes community will consider both whether the mechanisms described here would meet the IETF's needs and, especially, whether the linkages among the abstracted functions it describes are adequate and complete.</t>
