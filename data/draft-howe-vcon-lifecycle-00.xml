    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes using the SCITT (Supply Chain, Integrity, Transparency, and Trust) protocol to record, communicate and coordinate the lifecycle of Virtual Conversations (vCons), which are standardized containers for conversational data like call recordings, transcripts, and chat logs. While vCons enable capturing and sharing conversation details for AI analysis and business purposes, they lack mechanisms for proving compliance with privacy regulations and consent management. SCITT addresses this by providing an immutable, append-only transparency ledger that records key lifecycle events—from vCon creation and consent management to call recording, as well as data processing and deletion—enabling entities to demonstrate regulatory compliance and maintain trust across distributed systems. The framework specifically addresses consent management challenges under regulations like GDPR and CCPA, where consent can be revoked at any time, requiring coordinated deletion across all parties that have received the vCon. By combining vCons with SCITT, organizations can build scalable, transparent governance systems that protect personal data rights while enabling responsible use of conversational data for AI and business applications.</t>
