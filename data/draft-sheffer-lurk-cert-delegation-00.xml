      <t>An organization that owns web content often prefers to delegate hosting of this content to a Content Delivery Network (CDN). To serve HTTP content securely, it needs to be protected with TLS. This document proposes a way for the CDN to request constrained certificates so that it can serve web content on behalf of the content owner, without having the owner's long term certificate.</t>
