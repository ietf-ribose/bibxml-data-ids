    <abstract>
      <t>In the SCTP protocol stack implementations available for deployment in operational networks, it has been usually observed that the list of parameters that can be configured by the operators is often restricted to the list of SCTP protocol parameter values that are recommended for SCTP given in the IETF RFC 4960. However, this list is not exhaustive. This document updates the IETF RFC 4960 by including the SACK delay as part of the list of SCTP protocol parameters that can be configurable by an SCTP administrator. The associated recommended value is also given, according to the IETF RFC 4960</t>
