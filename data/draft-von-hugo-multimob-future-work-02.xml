      <t>The WG MultiMob aims at defining a basic mobile multicast solutionleveraging on network localized mobility management, i.e. ProxyMobile IPv6 protocol. The solution would be basically based onmulticast group management, i.e. IGMP/MLD, proxying at the accessgateway. If such a basic solution is essential from an operationalpoint of view, challenges with efficient resource utilization anduser perceived service quality still persist. These issues mayprevent large scale deployments of mobile multicast applications.This document attempts to identify topics for near future extensionof work such as modifying multimob base solution, PMIPv6 and MLD/IGMP for optimal multicast support, and adaptation of Handoveroptimization. Far future items such as extending to and modifyingof MIPv4/v6 and DSMIP, sender (source) mobility, consideration ofmultiple flows and multihoming will be dealt with in a futureversion.</t>
