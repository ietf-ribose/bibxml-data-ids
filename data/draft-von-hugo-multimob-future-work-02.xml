    <abstract>
      <t>The WG MultiMob aims at defining a basic mobile multicast solution leveraging on network localized mobility management, i.e. Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol. The solution would be basically based on multicast group management, i.e. IGMP/MLD, proxying at the access gateway. If such a basic solution is essential from an operational point of view, challenges with efficient resource utilization and user perceived service quality still persist. These issues may prevent large scale deployments of mobile multicast applications. This document attempts to identify topics for near future extension of work such as modifying multimob base solution, PMIPv6 and MLD/ IGMP for optimal multicast support, and adaptation of Handover optimization. Far future items such as extending to and modifying of MIPv4/v6 and DSMIP, sender (source) mobility, consideration of multiple flows and multihoming will be dealt with in a future version.</t>
