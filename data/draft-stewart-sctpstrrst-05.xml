      <t>Many applications that desire to use SCTP have requested the ability to "reset" a stream. The intention of resetting a stream is to start the numbering sequence of the stream back at 'zero' with a corresponding notification to the upper layer that this act as been performed. The applications that have requested this feature normally desire it so that they can "re-use" streams for different purposes but still utilize the stream sequence number for the application to track the message flows. Thus, without this feature, a new use on an old stream would result in message numbers larger than expected without a protocol mechanism to "start the streams back at zero". This documents presents also a method for resetting the transport sequence numbers and all stream sequence numbers.</t>
