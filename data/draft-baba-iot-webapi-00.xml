      <t>The University of Tokyo (UOT) is currently performing a demonstration experiment in COMMA House, the experimental smart-house owned by UOT and used as a connected house. The things installed in the house (Things) are operated using applications on smartphones and other devices. The various Things in the smart-house are operated online via a Web API that has been created as a prototype. This report is an overview of the experimental demonstration, which is gradually clarifying that Web API should be effective for solving issues for IoT.</t>
