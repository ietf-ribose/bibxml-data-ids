      <t>This memo describes a method (called Partial Resolution Method) for resolving IP addresses to ATM addresses. It does not specify a particular Address Resolution Protocol. In fact, any server-based address resolution protocol can be used in conjunction with the method described in this document. The Partial Resolution Method attempts to reduce the number of round trips needed for ATM address resolution and subsequent connection establishment by taking advantage of the ATM signalling protocol.</t>
