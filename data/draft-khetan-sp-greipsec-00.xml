      <t>When IPSec tunneling is used for VPN connections, transporting routing protocols across the encrypted tunnels becomes challenging. This document outlines the use of GRE encapsulation in conjunction with IPSec transport mode to support transport of dynamic routing protocols across an IPSec encrypted tunnel. Some usage scenarios are also addressed in this document.</t>
