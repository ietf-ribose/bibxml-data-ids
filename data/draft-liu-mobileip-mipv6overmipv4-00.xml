      <t>This document specifies a mechanism for Mobile IPv6 nodes of a 6to4 site [4] to continue utilizing Mobile IPv6 [5] services when they roam into IPv4 domains. The mechanism is based on Mobile IPv6 and Mobile IPv4 [7] glued together naturally by the 6to4 protocol [4] for delivering IPv6 packets between the Mobile IPv6 nodes and their Mobile IPv6 home agents. To support the mechanism specified in this draft, the Mobile IPv6 nodes MUST be Mobile IPv4 capable and MUST NOT utilize Mobile IPv6 route optimization. The 6to4 border router(s) at the 6to4 site MUST also be capable to act as Mobile IPv4 home agent(s).</t>
