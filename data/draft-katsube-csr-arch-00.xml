    <abstract>
      <t>This memorandum describes an internetworking architecture of Cell Switch Router (CSR) and related control protocol overview. Cell Switch Router is an ATM-based label switching router that can provide ATM cut-through paths for packet flows with various levels of granularity while retaining current router-based internetworking architecture. The proposed architecture is able to provide the cut-through path in response to the creation of IP forwarding entry (topology-driven), the arrival of data packets (traffic-driven), and the reception of control packets such as RSVP (request-driven). One important feature that is provided by the proposed architecture is interoperability with the emerging ATM network platform, specified by the ATM Forum and/or ITU-T, which provides PVC (Permanent Virtual Channel), VP (Virtual Path), or SVC (Switched Virtual Channel) services.</t>
