      <t>The ACAP [ACAP] Dataset Model is very extensible, and allows applications to easily share options and information. With this extensibility comes a complexity that an application designer must fully understand in order to interoperate while using ACAP. This document will help the reader understand and visualize the ACAP hierarchy, come to a better understanding of how to design and access ACAP datasets, and understand the relationship between attributes, entries, datasets, and dataset classes.</t>
