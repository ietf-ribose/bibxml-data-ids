      <t>Remote IETF hubs seem to be springing up organically in quite a few regions. There appear to be regional differences in how hubs are organized. Latin America has quite a few remote hubs as does India. The two regions are different in how they arose, where they meet, and what they do. Thus, creating a template for a remote hub may not work because hubs may be very different across cultures and of very different sizes. Lastly, this document discusses how IETF "central" can assist with remote hubs.</t>
