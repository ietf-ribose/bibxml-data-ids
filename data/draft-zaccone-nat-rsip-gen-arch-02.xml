      <t>Currently, the RSIP framework [RSIP-FRAM] focus its architecture onthe typical scenario where hosts on a private realm are connected toan external realm by the mean of an unique gateway where the majorityof the functionality's are concentrated.The aim of this document is to extend ths scope by describing ageneric architecture. Furthermore, it tries to identify thefunctionality's of the system, their purposes as well as the way theyinterwork.The benefits of this extention are an increase of the robustness ofthe system and an opportunity to gain benefit of multiple connectiontowards one or more (multi-homing) external realms (ISPs).</t>
