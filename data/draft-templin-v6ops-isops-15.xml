      <t>Many end user sites in the Internet today still have predominantly IPv4 internal infrastructures. These sites range in size from small home/office networks to large corporate enterprise networks, but share the commonality that IPv4 continues to provide satisfactory internal routing and addressing services for most applications. As more and more IPv6-only services are deployed in the Internet, however, end user devices within such sites will increasingly require at least basic IPv6 functionality for external access. This document therefore provides operational guidance for deployment of IPv6 within predominantly IPv4 sites using the Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP).</t>
