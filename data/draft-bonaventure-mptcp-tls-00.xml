      <t>Multipath TCP and the Transport Layer Security (TLS) include several techniques that improve the reliability and the security of data transfers. In this document we propose Multipath TLS (MPTLS), a tighter coupling between TLS and Multipath TCP that provides improved security and reliability in the presence of adversaries. MPTLS would the resilience of existing TLS applications to attacks. It could also serve as a basis for the TCP extension that is being discussed within the TCPINC working group to provide unauthenticated encryption and integrity protection of TCP streams.</t>
