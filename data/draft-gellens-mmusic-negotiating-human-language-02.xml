      <t>Users have various human (natural) language needs, abilities, and preferences regarding spoken, written, and signed languages. When establishing interactive communication "calls" there needs to be a way to communicate and ideally match (i.e., negotiate) the caller's language preferences with the capabilities of the called party. This is especially important with emergency calls, where a call can be routed to a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) or call taker capable of communicating with the user, or a translator or relay operator can be bridged into the call during setup, but this applies to non-emergency calls as well (as an example, when calling a company call center). This document describes the need and expected use, and describes a solution using new SDP stream attributes plus an optional SIP "hint."</t>
