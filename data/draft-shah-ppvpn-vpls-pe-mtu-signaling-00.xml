      <t>The [DTLS] draft identifies the need for an information exchange mechanism between a PE device and its adjunct L2PE devices in the decoupled transparent LAN architecture. For example, the PE needs to provide information to an L2PE about the existence of remote site(s), and the MPLS label(s) that the L2PE needs to use to reach those site(s). The [HVPLS] draft requires signaling between the PE- rs and the MTU-s device to setup the spoke VC connection for the VPLS service.</t>
