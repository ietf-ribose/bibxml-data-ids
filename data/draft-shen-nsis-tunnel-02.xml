      <t>This draft presents an NSIS operation over IP tunnels scheme usingQoS NSLP as the NSIS signaling application. Both sender-initiatedand receiver-initiated reservation modes are discussed. The schemeproposes the use of separate signaling sessions inside the tunnel forthe end-to-end sessions. Packets belonging to qualified tunnelsessions are assigned special flow IDs to be distinguished from therest of the tunnel traffic. The end-to-end session and itscorresponding tunnel session are associated with each other whennecessary; so that adjustment in one session may be reflected in theother.</t>
