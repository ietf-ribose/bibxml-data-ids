      <t>This draft presents an NSIS operation over IP tunnels scheme using QoS NSLP as the NSIS signaling application. Both sender-initiated and receiver-initiated reservation modes are discussed. The scheme proposes the use of separate signaling sessions inside the tunnel for the end-to-end sessions. Packets belonging to qualified tunnel sessions are assigned special flow IDs to be distinguished from the rest of the tunnel traffic. The end-to-end session and its corresponding tunnel session are associated with each other when necessary; so that adjustment in one session may be reflected in the other.</t>
