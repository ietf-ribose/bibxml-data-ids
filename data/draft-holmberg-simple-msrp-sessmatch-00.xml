      <t>This document updates the session matching procedure defined insection 7.3 of RFC 4975, so that an MSRP UA only uses the session-idpart of the MSRP URI in order to perform the consistency checks. Theupdate allows intermediate network entities (ALGs) to modify theaddress information in the MSRP URI of the SDP a=path attribute,without the need for the intermediate to terminate and do thecorrelating modifications in the associated MSRP messages.Status of this MemoThis Internet-Draft is submitted to IETF in full conformance with theprovisions of BCP 78 and BCP 79.Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet EngineeringTask Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.
