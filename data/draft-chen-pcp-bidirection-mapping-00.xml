      <t>The memo has proposed a bi-directional option, along with which PCPcould not only control PCP client pinhole, but also could manage portmapping status for communicating remote peers. The bi-directionalport control mode will eliminate risks of connections interruptioncaused by remote peer pinhole timeout.</t>
