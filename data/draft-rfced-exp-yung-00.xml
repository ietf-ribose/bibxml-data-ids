      <t>The Trivial File Transfer Protocol [1] is a simple, lock-step, filetransfer protocol which allows a client to get or put a file onto aremote host. This document describes a new TFTP option. This new option will allowthe multiple client to receive the same file concurrently through theuse of Multicast packets. The TFTP Option Extension mechanism isdescribed in [2]. Often when similar computers are booting remotely they will eachdownload the same image file. By adding multicast into the TFTP optionset, two or more computers can download a file concurrently, thusincreasing network efficiency. This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the terminologyand notation of both [1] and [2].</t>
