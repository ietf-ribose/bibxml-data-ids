      <t>RADIUS has become the defacto protocol between network edge devices (e,g, dial NAS or Wireless AP) and a backend Authentication Server. In this environment the backend Server is often called a (RADIUS Server). RADIUS is gaining very broad penetration, even into homes, because of its use with wireless authentication. Because of the amount of deployed infrastructure already in place, we believe that RADIUS will not be supplanted by another authentication service in the foreseeable future. Because the widespread deployment in wireless has different infrastructure requirements than what is required for dialup, RADIUS requirements, especially trust between Edge devices and RADIUS Servers needs to be addressed. This document sets the requirements for RADIUS security and then sets forth technologies that will satisfy those requirements.</t>
