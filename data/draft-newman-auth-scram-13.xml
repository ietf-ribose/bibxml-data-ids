      <t>The secure authentication mechanism most widely deployed and used byInternet application protocols is the transmission of clear-textpasswords over a channel protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS).There are some significant security concerns with that mechanism,which could be addressed by the use of a challenge responseauthentication mechanism protected by TLS. Unfortunately, thechallenge response mechanisms presently on the standards track allfail to meet requirements necessary for widespread deployment, andhave had success only in limited use.This specification describes a family of Simple Authentication andSecurity Layer (SASL, RFC 4422) authentication mechanisms called theSalted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism (SCRAM), whichaddresses the security concerns and meets the deployabilityrequirements. When used in combination with TLS or an equivalentsecurity layer, a mechanism from this family could improve thestatus-quo for application protocol authentication and provide asuitable choice for a mandatory-to-implement mechanism for futureapplication protocol standards.</t>
