    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies a framework for dynamically adjusting network configurations in response to cloud service scaling events. As cloud services grow, increase traffic, or add resources, automatically adapting network configurations can improve performance and enable greater interoperability. Manual network adjustments are often slow, error-prone, and inadequate for the rapid changes of cloud services. The proposed framework, along with the associated YANG models, facilitates seamless interoperability among network controllers and equipment from various vendors, which is an essential requirement for Telecom Cloud providers operating in multi-vendor environments.</t>
