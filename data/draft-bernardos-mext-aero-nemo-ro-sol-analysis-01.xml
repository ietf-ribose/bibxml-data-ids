      <t>The Network Mobility Basic Support protocol enables networks to roamand attach to different access networks without disrupting theongoing sessions that nodes of the mobile network may have. Byextending the Mobile IPv6 support to Mobile Routers, nodes of themobile network are not required to support any kind of mobility,since packets go through the Mobile Router-Home Agent (MRHA) bi-directional tunnel. Data packets belonging to communications ofnodes of the mobile network have to traverse the Home Agent, andtherefore resulting paths are likely to be suboptimal. Additionally,the solution adds packet overhead, due to the use of encapsulationbetween the Mobile Router and the Home Agent.There are currently a set of well defined NEMO Route Optimizationrequirements for Operational Use in Aeronautics and SpaceExploration, which potential solutions should meet. This documentanalyses how the problem of NEMO RO for Aeronautics Mobile Networksmight be tackled, in a way as generic as possible, trying to identifythose open questions and deployment considerations that need to beaddressed.The main goal of this document is to foster the discussion aboutaeronautics NEMO RO solution space within the MEXT WG.</t>
