      <t>Localized Mobility Management (LMM) requires mobility support for a mobile station within a restricted and topologically localized portion of the network. Mobile IPv6 is a standardized mobility protocol for IPv6 that can be extended to address the local mobility management requirements. This document describes a solution based on Proxy Mobile IPv6 scheme by introducing new functional entities and extensions to the protocol and by restricting the mobility signaling to only certain entities in the network.</t>
