      <t>This document presents five extensions to the PPP/LCP Protocol : * Assistance from a router to another router (or a host) lookingfor its Operating System file.* Assistance from a router to another router (or a host) lookingfor its configuration file.* Request from an equipment to receive Discard frame when no Dataframe can be sent. When no Discard or Data frames are receivedthe link will be brought down. This method is more efficientthan using a timeout and/or a keepalive mecanism.* Interface Bandwidth and Delay measurements. These informationscan be used by OSPF or any other IGP protocol.</t>
