    <abstract>
      <t>This draft introduces a novel communication architecture, called Distributed Micro Service Communication architecture (DMSC). It includes multiple aspects of microservice communication, such as service registration, service discovery, service routing, service scheduling, and more, Which to achieve all the essential functionalities provided by current centralized service networks. By incorporating content-semantic communication, DMSC significantly enhances the performance, scalability, and reliability of microservice communication. It provides a robust architecture for managing the complex communication requirements of distributed microservices, ensuring data integrity, security, and efficient resource utilization. Furthermore, DMSC provides a reference direction for the transition of the service mesh infrastructure from a location-based model to a content- and service-centric paradigm.</t>
