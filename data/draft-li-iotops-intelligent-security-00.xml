    <abstract>
      <t>Communication technology is becoming more and more developed, the Internet of Things coverage is becoming more and more comprehensive, and a large number of data and devices are joining, which also makes more data security and privacy issues appear. Therefore, this draft proposes a scheme to build an information-centered network. By analyzing common network attack methods, an intelligent protection optimization system is established from three aspects: naming and parsing, data exchange, and data caching, so as to achieve better content privacy protection without adding additional costs.</t>
