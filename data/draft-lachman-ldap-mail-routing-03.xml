      <t>Directory services based on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [1] and X.500 [2] provide a general-purpose means to store information about users and other network entities. One of the many possible uses of a directory service is to store information about users' email accounts, such as their email addresses, and how messages addressed to them should be routed. In the interest of interoperability, it is desirable to have a common schema for such email-related information. This document defines an object class called 'mailRecipient' to support SMTP [3] message transfer agents (MTAs) in routing RFC 822- based email messages [4] within an organization. The intent is to suggest a model for MTA interoperability via the directory, to provide information about a solution that has been implemented and deployed, and to stimulate discussion about whether and how to standardize the functionality in question.</t>
