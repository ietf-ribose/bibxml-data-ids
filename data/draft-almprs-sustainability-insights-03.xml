    <abstract>
      <t>Internet and the ICT industry is consuming a sizable portion of the electricity available in the world today, and the fraction has been growing significantly over time. Data shows that the power draw of internet is relatively constant over the day and week, even though the “load” and delivered services vary greatly over this time span. This seems to suggest that there is room for optimizations. This document provides some definitions, some proposed principles for a solution, and then paints a picture of what a solution based on existing standards and some current internet drafts might look like. The first step of an optimization loop is to measure. This document proposes a mechanism to collect energy related telemetry data from the extremely diverse set of devices found in networks today, without necessarily updating the network elements. Once the collection is done, it’s also very relevant to be able to control the devices, and turn them into low power modes when the service demand is lower.</t>
