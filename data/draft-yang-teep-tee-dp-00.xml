    <abstract>
      <t>In big data area, computing resource manager like MESOS[MESOS], YARM[YARN], kubernets[Kubernetes] or computing framework like Spark[Spark], use Master-Worker structure to split computing task. In the master component, the computing task will be splited into different child tasks. Each of thess child tasks will be loaded to a executor which is managed by Worker. The Master and Worker are usually exist as cluster, cloud or other distributed framework. When the big data tasks needs to be processed in TEE in lifecycle, this document could be used for Master to provision child tasks in distributed TEEs.</t>
