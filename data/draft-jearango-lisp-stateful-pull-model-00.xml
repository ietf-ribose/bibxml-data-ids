      <t>This document specifies a stateful pull model for LISP where ITRs can subscribe with the mapping system to be notified whenever a particular EID mapping changes. The model uses a publish/subscribe mechanism that supports overlapping EID registrations without having to notify the ITR about every single prefix covered by a particular subscription. The pull model is stateful in the sense that it requires that the mapping system maintain subscription state.</t>
