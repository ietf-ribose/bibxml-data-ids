      <t>Many protocols in the Internet Protocol suite use packetencapsulations. This runs into the danger of forming a tunnel loop.Since each tunnel entry point encapsulates the inner packet with atunnel packet header that contains a new hop count, a packet enteringa tunnel loop may be routed infinitely, consuming network resources.Although there exist methods to cause a packet in a tunnel loop to bediscarded eventually, it would be more desirable to detect thepresence of a tunnel loop and act accordingly. This draft exploresthe possibility for tunnel entry points to detect the presence of atunnel loop by using an extra identifier tagged to the outer packetheader.</t>
