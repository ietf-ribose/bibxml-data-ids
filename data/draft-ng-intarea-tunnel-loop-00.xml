    <abstract>
      <t>Many protocols in the Internet Protocol suite use packet encapsulations. This runs into the danger of forming a tunnel loop. Since each tunnel entry point encapsulates the inner packet with a tunnel packet header that contains a new hop count, a packet entering a tunnel loop may be routed infinitely, consuming network resources. Although there exist methods to cause a packet in a tunnel loop to be discarded eventually, it would be more desirable to detect the presence of a tunnel loop and act accordingly. This draft explores the possibility for tunnel entry points to detect the presence of a tunnel loop by using an extra identifier tagged to the outer packet header.</t>
