      <t>This document describes PAX Pattern Description Language (PDL). PAX is a special purpose language for definitions of filters (recognizers) for sequential inputs. The language is suitable for describing pattern matching criteria in policy-based networking devices such as QoS routers and switches, packet filters, RMON probes, traffic shapers, etc. It pro- vides consistent means of programming policy-based networking devices based on different hardware and software platforms. Programs written in PAX can be built incrementally, where elementary patterns can be used as building blocks for more complex ones. The language encourages modular and object-oriented design.</t>
