      <t>TLS 1.2 is in widespread use and can be configured such that it provides good security properties. TLS 1.3 is also in widespread use and fixes some known deficiencies with TLS 1.2, such as removing error-prone cryptographic primitives and encrypting more of the traffic so that it is not readable by outsiders. Since TLS 1.3 use is widespread, new protocols must require and assume its existence. This prescription does not pertain to DTLS (in any DTLS version); it pertains to TLS only.</t>
