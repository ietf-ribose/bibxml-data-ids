    <abstract>
      <t>RFC8299 defines a L3VPN Service YANG data Model (L3SM) that can be used for communication between customers and VPN service providers. That data model plays the role of a Customer Service Model, according to the terminology defined in RFC8309, and is as such adequate for service negotiation and order handling matters. There is a need for a more network-centric YANG data model to be used in the communication between the entity that interacts directly with the customer, the service orchestrator, (either fully automated or a human operator) and the entity in charge of network orchestration and control (a.k.a., network controller/orchestrator). This document specifies a L3VPN Network YANG Model (L3NM) to facilitate communication between a service orchestrator and a network controller/orchestrator. Such data model provides a network-centric view of the L3VPN services. The Yang model proposed is limited to BGP PE-based VPNs as described in RFCs 4026, 4110, and 4364.</t>
