    <abstract>
      <t>This protocol is designed for small groups of users sending relatively small messages. It is optimized for the assumption that a node will come online and collect all messages at least once every 15 days and that some nodes that act as mirrors will be online most of the time but may come and go over long periods of time.</t>
