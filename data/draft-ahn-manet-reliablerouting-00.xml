    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a reliable MANET routing mechanism based on the node mobility detection. To detect the node mobility, each node maintains the Neighbor Node table and measures the stability of its neighboring environment. Using the route stability information, reliabille routing can be achieved.</t>
