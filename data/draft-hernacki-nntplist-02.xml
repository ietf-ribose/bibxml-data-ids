      <t>This document describes a set of enhancements to the Network News Transport Protocol [NNTP-977] that allows extended server specific information to be obtained by the client. These enhancements will be made as new arguments to the existing LIST verb described in the NNTP protocol [NNTP-977]. The availability of the extensions described here will be advertised by the server using the extension negotiation-mechanism described in the new NNTP protocol specification currently being developed [NNTP-NEW].</t>
