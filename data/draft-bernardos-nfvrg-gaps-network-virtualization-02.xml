    <abstract>
      <t>Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) are changing the way the telecommunications sector will deploy, extend and operate their networks. These new technologies aim at reducing the overall costs by outsourcing communication services from specific hardware in the operators' core to server farms scattered in datacenters (i.e. compute and storage virtualization). In addition, the connecting networks are fundamentally affected in they way they route, process and control traffic(i.e. network virtualization). Virtualization is becoming a trend which is being adopted in many scenarios for different purposes. This document overviews existing efforts around virtualization at the IETF/IRTF, focusing on those related to NFV and SDN. These efforts are mapped to the most relevant architectures being defined outside IETF, namely at the ETSI NFV ISG, the ETSI MEC ISG and the ONF. The main goal of this document is to serve as a survey of the different efforts that have been taken and are currently taking place at IETF and IRTF in regards to network virtualization, putting them into context considering efforts by other SDOs, and identifying current gaps that can be tackled at IETF or researched at the IRTF.</t>
