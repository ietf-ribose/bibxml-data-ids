      <t>Efficient detection of network attachment in IPv6 needs the following two components: a method for the host to query routers on the link to identify the link (Link Identification) and a method for the routers on the link to consistently respond to such a query with minimal delay (Fast RA). Solving the link identification based strictly on RFC 2461 is difficult because of the flexibilities offered to routers in terms of prefixes advertised in a router advertisement (RA) message. Similarly, the random delay in responding to router solicitation messages imposed by RFC 2461 makes to it difficult to achieve fast RA. A known set of solutions to these two problems was identified and catalogued by the DNA design team. In this memo, an integrated solution is presented, based on a sub-set of the catalogued solutions. This integrated solution consolidates most of the advantages of all known solutions while addressing most of the disadvantages.</t>
