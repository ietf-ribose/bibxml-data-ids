      <t>The aim of this document is to define a small set of metrics that arerobust, easy to understand, orthogonal, relevant, and easy tocompute. The IPPM WG has defined a large number of richlyparameterized metrics because network measurement has many purposes.Often, the ultimate purpose is to report a concise set of metricsdescribing a network's state to an end user. It is for this purposethat the present set of metrics is defined.</t>
