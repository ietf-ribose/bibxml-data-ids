    <abstract>
      <t>The document defines a new BGP SAFI with a new NLRI in order to advertise a SD-WAN edge node's capabilities in establishing SD-WAN overlay tunnels with other SD-WAN nodes through third party untrusted networks. The goal is for SD-WAN network to scale, enabling SD-WAN overlay tunnels among large number of SD-WAN nodes to be established with few provisioning needed. A "SD-WAN" tunnel refers to a point-to-point IPsec overlay path between two end-points that can aggregate multiple different types of underlay networks. An "end-point" is referring to a port on a SD- WAN node throughout this document. This document specifies new sub-TLVs for the SD-WAN Tunnel Encapsulation Attribute.</t>
