      <t>This memo describes a method for describing the changes made to an email during common email modifications, for example those caused by mailing lists and forwarders. While this is general enough to be used for any changes, it is anticipated that this method will normally be used for removing added data rather than large complex changes. This method also captures hashes of important features of the message, allowing validation that the changes were described correctly, and allowing a signature which covers the Mail-Version header to, by extention, ensure that the important content of the message is unchanged.</t>
