      <t>Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) is network based mobility protocol which provides IP session continuity for a mobile node without its involvement in mobility management. PMIPv6 also can be viewed as a service and authorization provided by networks. A mobile node can decide if it wants to use the service or not. This proposal describes an Extensible Authentication Protocol(EAP) based mechanism for the service negotiation between a mobile node and an AAA server.</t>
