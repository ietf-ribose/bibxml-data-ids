      <t>The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs) requests. Segment routing (SR) leverages the source routing and tunneling paradigms. The Stateful PCEP extensions allow stateful control of Segment Routing Traffic Engineering (TE) Paths. Furthermore, PCEP can be used for computing SR TE paths in the network. This document defines PCEP extensions for grouping two unidirectional SR Paths (one in each direction in the network) into a single associated bidirectional SR Path. The mechanisms defined in this document can also be applied using a stateful PCE for both PCE- initiated and PCC-initiated LSPs or when using a stateless PCE.</t>
