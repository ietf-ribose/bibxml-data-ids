      <t>This informational document attempts to analyze several critical issues with failover of IPSec Gateways (IG) distributed across different networks. Additionally, several candidate approaches to such issues are listed and compared. The objective of this work is to provide useful information for the future research in the failover of multiple geographically distributed IGs.</t>
