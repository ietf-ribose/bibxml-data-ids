      <t>This document defines how a membership test can be used to convey allor some of the EID-to-RLOC mappings from an Egress Tunnel Router torequesting Ingress Tunnel Router. This draft proposes that anauthoritative ETR MAY return a group membership test in the LISP Map-Reply Message that indicates if a given EID is served by the ETR.The membership test is implemented as a Bloom filter. A Bloom filteris compact data structure to represent a set of elements. Themembership test "aggregates" EIDs beyond prefix based aggregation.Membership test decreases the load of the mapping system anddistributes the EID-to-RLOC resolution between an ITR and an ETR.</t>
