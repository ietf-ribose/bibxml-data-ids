    <abstract>
      <t>At the time of writing, the Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL) is defined by RFC 8610 and RFC 9165. The latter has used the extension point provided in RFC 8610, the _control operator_. As CDDL is being used in larger projects, the need for corrections and additional features has become known that cannot be easily mapped into this single extension point. Hence, there is a need for evolution of the base CDDL specification itself. The present document updates errata and makes other small fixes for the ABNF grammar defined for CDDL in RFC 8610. // Previous versions of the changes in this document were part of // draft-bormann-cbor-cddl-2-draft and previously draft-bormann-cbor- // cddl-freezer. This submission extracts out those grammar changes // that are ready for WG adoption and publication.</t>
