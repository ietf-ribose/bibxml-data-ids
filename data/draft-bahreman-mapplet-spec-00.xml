      <t>The applets written in the Java programming [JAVA] language are becoming a household name on the World Wide Web. Currently, web browsers are able to retrieve and display these applets. This document describes a set of guidelines for conforming mail user agents to be able to send and display applets. The applets are transferred within a MIME [MIME] message. In order to do this, a new MIME subtype, Application/Applet, is being defined in this document. We also discuss how other protocols for adding security to MIME objects could be used to provide additional security.</t>
