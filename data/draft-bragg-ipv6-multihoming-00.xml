      <t>The IPv6 Addressing scheme mandates provider addressing to achieveaggregation. Multi-homing is a fact of life. Current proposals toreconcile these requirements involve mitigation, by constrainingdeployment topologies to avoid loss of aggregation in the backboneonly. This draft views the combined requirement as equivalent tothe use of loose source routing by hosts, and makes some outlineproposals as to how this can be achieved.</t>
