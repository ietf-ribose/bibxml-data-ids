    <abstract>
      <t>The IPv6 Addressing scheme mandates provider addressing to achieve aggregation. Multi-homing is a fact of life. Current proposals to reconcile these requirements involve mitigation, by constraining deployment topologies to avoid loss of aggregation in the backbone only. This draft views the combined requirement as equivalent to the use of loose source routing by hosts, and makes some outline proposals as to how this can be achieved.</t>
