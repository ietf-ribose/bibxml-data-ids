      <t>Although BGP implementations have extensive path selectionalgorithms, in practice operators have trouble performingsatisfactory traffic engineering of incoming traffic based on BGPattributes that are taken into account in the path selectionalgorithm alone. For this reason, many ASes deaggregate theiraddress range(s) into smaller blocks and announce these blocksdifferently to different neighboring ASes in order to arrive at thedesired traffic flow. This practice contributes to the growth of theglobal routing table, which drives up capital expenditures fornetworks engaging in inter-domain routing. This memo introduces anew inter-domain metric that supports finer-grained trafficengineering than current BGP attributes.</t>
