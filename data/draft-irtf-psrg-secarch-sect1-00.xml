      <t>The Internet Security Architecture is intended to be a guide for designing and implementing protocols for use in the Internet. The Architecture was begun by the Privacy and Security Research Group (PSRG) of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF). It is ongoing effort of the PSRG in cooperation with the Security Directorate of the IETF. This draft presents Section 1 of the Architecture. Section 1 explains why the Architecture is needed, describes its scope, reviews networking and security concepts and terms, and states architectural principles for Internet security. Section 2 will discusses security services in networks, and Section 3 will discuss security mechanisms. Section 4 will discuss the correspondence between security services, security mechanisms, and protocol layers, explaining each service placement. Section 5 will describe the security status of the Internet suite of protocols, covering seven functional areas: network and transport, intra-domain routing, inter-domain routing, infrastructure services, remote processing, and applications. Section 6 will describe how to deploy available security technology in five scenarios of increasing complexity.</t>
