      <t>This document has a normative description of the service flow management technology based on mobile IPv6 (MIPv6). It makes the upgrade of management model in MIPv6 from the entire node granularity to the single service flow granularity. It proposes a distributed mobility management solution, DMIPv6, which is compatible with MIPv6 and takes different mobility management strategies according to the Correspondent Node's position, network conditions and service requirements of different service flows so as to achieve the service flow handoff and transmission path control. The standard also provides route optimization mechanism between the Mobile Node and the ordinary Correspondent Node that doesn't support mobile IPv6.</t>
