      <t>Recently there are a number of efforts [sw1, sw2, in,tpc, etc.] of trying toconnect the packet-switching network with circuit-switching network, especiallyconnecting the Internet with public telephone networks. The first problemof such interconnection is naming and addressing, later will come withdirectory services and routing problems. This draft concentrates onnaming for DNS and URL. Other problems are discussed in other documents[utrpt, framework].</t>
