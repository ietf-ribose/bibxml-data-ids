      <t>The Secure Webhook Token (SWT) is a specialized JSON Web Token (JWT) format designed for securely authorizing and verifying webhook requests. It defines a set of claims to ensure that the token is explicitly tied to webhook events and that its integrity can be reliably validated by the recipient. A key feature of SWT is the introduction of a unique claim, webhook, which encapsulates webhook- specific information, such as the event type. By providing a structured and secure approach to webhook authentication, SWT aims to be a lightweight and flexible solution while maintaining compatibility with typical JWT structures. It is designed with the best practices in mind and may serve as a foundation for future standardization efforts.</t>
