      <t>IS-IS currently defines two different kinds of authentication schemes: Clear Text password and HMAC-MD5. There has been recently a new draft submitted that adds support for a generic cryptographic authentication scheme, which can make use of different cryptographic algorithms in order to authenticate the IS-IS PDUs. To ensure interoperability between disparate implementations, it is imperative that we specify a set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations will have available. This document defines the current set of mandatory-to-implement algorithms to be used for the cryptographic authentication for IS-IS as well as specifying the algorithms that should be implemented because they may be promoted to mandatory at some future time.</t>
