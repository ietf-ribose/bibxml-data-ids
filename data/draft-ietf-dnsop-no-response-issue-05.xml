      <t>The DNS is a query / response protocol. Failure to respond or to respond correctly to queries causes both immediate operational problems and long term problems with protocol development. This document identifies a number of common kinds of queries which some servers either fail to respond or else respond incorrectly. This document also suggests procedures for TLD and other zone operators to apply to help reduce / eliminate the problem. The document does not look at the DNS data itself, just the structure of the responses.</t>
