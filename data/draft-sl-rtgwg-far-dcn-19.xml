    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes a generic routing method and protocol for a regular data center network, named the Fault-Avoidance Routing (FAR) protocol. The FAR protocol provides a generic routing method for all types of regular topology network architectures that have been proposed for large-scale cloud-based data centers over the past few years. The FAR protocol is designed to leverage any regularity in the topology and compute its routing table in a concise manner. Fat- tree is taken as an example architecture to illustrate how the FAR protocol can be applied in real operational scenarios.</t>
