    <abstract>
      <t>One feature that the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol provides is that it allows the members of a group to confirm that they agree on certain data. In this document, we define a mechanism for applications using MLS to exploit this feature of MLS to ensure that the group members are in agreement on the state of the application in addition to MLS-related state. We define a GroupContext extension that captures the state of the application and an AppSync proposal that can be used to update the application state.</t>
