    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a C language application program interface (API)to the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). This documentreplaces the previous definition of this API, defined in RFC 1823,updating it to include support for features found in version 3 of theLDAP protocol. New extended operation functions were added to supportLDAPv3 features such as controls. In addition, other LDAP API changeswere made to support information hiding and thread safety. The C LDAP API is designed to be powerful, yet simple to use. It definescompatible synchronous and asynchronous interfaces to LDAP to suit awide variety of applications. This document gives a brief overview ofthe LDAP model, then an overview of how the API is used by an applica-tion program to obtain LDAP information. The API calls are described indetail, followed by appendices that provide example code demonstratinguse of the API, the namespace consumed by the API, a summary of require-ments for API extensions, known incompatibilities with RFC 1823, and alist of changes made since the last revision of this document.</t>
