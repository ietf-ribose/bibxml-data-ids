      <t>This memo describes the applicability of the Internet standardizationefforts on secure electronic data interchange (EDI) transactions forHealth Level-7 (HL7), an EDI standard for healthcare used worldwide.This memo heavily relies on the work in progress by the IETF EDIINTworking group. It is in most parts a restatement of the EDIINTsrequirements document and application statement 1 (AS#1) tailored to theneeds of the HL7 audience. We tried to make this document as selfconsistent as possible. The goal is to give to the reader who is not asecurity or Internet standards expert enough foundational and detailinformation to enable him to build communication software that compliesto the Internet standards. Even though we rely on and promote the respective Internet standardsand drafts, we did not withstand from commenting on and criticising thiswork where we see upcoming problems in use with HL7 or other EDIprotocols that have not been in the initial focus of the EDIINT workinggroup. We make suggestions to add parameters to the specification of theMIME type for EDI messages [RFC 1767] in order to enhance functionality.We give use cases for a larger subset of disposition types and modifiersof message disposition notifications. One key issue where this memo goes beyond the current EDIINT draftsis the concept of non-repudiation of commitment to an EDI transaction.Secure EDI transactions should be regarded as ``distributed contracts,''i.e. not only the sending and receiving of single messages should benon-refutable but also the connection between messages interchanges. Inanticipation of this requirement HL7 usually requires a response messageto be sent to acknowledge every transaction. We therefore have therequirement to securely couple an EDI response message to its requestmessage. Given the current shape of RFC 1767 this is generally possibleonly if a response message is coupled with an MDN receipt and thecombi</t>
