      <t>This document specifies a new mechanism to solve mobility problems over IPv6 transition networks which IPv6 sites are interconnected over a wide area network which has no native IPv6 support[4]. This draft defines an extended mechanism of 6to4 mechanism[4] and Mobile IPv6[2] to support mobility over 6to4. It also describes scenarios for using the proposed mechanism during the co-existence period.</t>
