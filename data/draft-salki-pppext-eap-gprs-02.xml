      <t>This document specifies an extension to the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) [2], referred to as EAP-GPRS, which allows GPRS clients to perform signaling procedures with a core GPRS network through devices that enforce EAP-based access control. For example, a GPRS client can use EAP-GPRS to attach to a GPRS network through an access point that enforces IEEE 802.1X [3] access control. In this case, the GPRS attach signaling is performed in the context of the underlying 802.1X procedure and the GPRS messages are encapsulated into EAP-GPRS packets. If the GPRS client is permitted to attach to the GPRS network, then the 802.1X procedure ends successfully and the client is authorized access to the access point. In general, EAP-GPRS allows any type of signaling to take place during the EAP authentication as an embedded signaling procedure. However, in this documents we particularly focus on GPRS specific signaling.</t>
