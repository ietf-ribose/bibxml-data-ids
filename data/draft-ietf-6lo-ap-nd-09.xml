      <t>This document specifies an extension to 6LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery (ND) defined in RFC6775 and updated in [I-D.ietf-6lo-rfc6775-update]. The new extension is called Address Protected Neighbor Discovery (AP- ND) and it protects the owner of an address against address theft and impersonation attacks in a low-power and lossy network (LLN). Nodes supporting this extension compute a cryptographic identifier (Crypto- ID) and use it with one or more of their Registered Addresses. The Crypto-ID identifies the owner of the Registered Address and can be used to provide proof of ownership of the Registered Addresses. Once an address is registered with the Crypto-ID and a proof-of-ownership is provided, only the owner of that address can modify the registration information, thereby enforcing Source Address Validation.</t>
