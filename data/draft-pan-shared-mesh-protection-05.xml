      <t>Shared mesh protection is a common protection and recovery mechanism in transport networks, where multiple paths can share the same set of network resources for protection purposes. In the context of MPLS-TP, it has been explicitly requested as a part of the overall solution (Req. 67, 68 and 69 in RFC5654 [RFC5654]). It's important to note that each MPLS-TP LSP may be associated with transport network resources. In event of network failure, it may require explicit activation on the protecting paths before switching user traffic over. In this memo, we define a lightweight signaling mechanism for protecting path activation in shared mesh protection-enabled MPLS-TP networks.</t>
