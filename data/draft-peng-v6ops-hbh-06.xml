      <t>This document describes the processing of the Hop-by-Hop Options Header (HBH) in today's routers in the aspects of standards specification, common implementations, and default operations. This document outlines the reasons why the Hop-by-Hop Options Header is rarely utilized in current networks. In addition, this document describes how the HBH could be used as a powerful mechanism allowing deployment and operations of new services requiring a more optimized way to leverage network resources of an infrastructure. The Hop-by- Hop Options Header is taken into consideration by several network operators as a valuable container for carrying the information facilitating the introduction of new services. The processing requirments of the HBH and the migration strategies are also suggested.</t>
