    <abstract>
      <t>Home networks are becoming more complex. With the launch of new services such as home security, IP video, Smart Grid, etc., many Service Providers are placing additional IPv4/IPv6 routers on the subscriber network. This document describes a self-configuring home router that is capable of operating in such an environment, and that requires no user interaction to configure it. Compliant with draft-ietf-homenet-arch, it uses existing protocols in new ways without the need for a routing protocol.</t>
