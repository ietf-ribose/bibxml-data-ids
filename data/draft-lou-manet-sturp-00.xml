      <t>This memo describes an approach to updating topologies in typical MANET-like environments, relying on what is termed 'sloppy updates' in the remainder of this document. Key to the approach is that updates are only initiated if existing communication relations may be effect by non-synchronized topology information, otherwise using the topology information as it exists. This 'sloppy' nature of the approach reduces the needed updates and the associated communication for them, thus increases efficiency as well as performance from a user perspective. As such, STURP does not provide a complete routing protocol solution but is intended to extend existing routing protocols with this improved efficiency mechanism instead.</t>
