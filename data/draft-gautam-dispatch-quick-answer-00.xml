      <t>In instant messaging system, it is useful to have some readily available IM (text, audio or video) which can be sent in case of the receiver is too busy to type/speak/record for a reply. These short IM (here after referred as QA - Quick Answer) can be created, stored and used when needed.

The QAs are delivered to the instant messaging sender in the same manner as the instant messages themselves.</t>
