      <t>The purpose of this memo is to describe and analyze the occurrence of misconnections in GMPLS networks. We present a problem statement, and describe some scenarios under which misconnections may happen. We then outline some common causes of misconnections and discuss some solutions to address them. Our goal is to facilitate further discussions of this issue and the associated solutions within the CCAMP Working Group.</t>
