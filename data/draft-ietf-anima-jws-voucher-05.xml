      <t>[RFC8366] defines a digital artifact called voucher as a YANG-defined JSON document that has been signed using a Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) structure. This memo introduces a variant of the voucher structure in which CMS is replaced by the JSON Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) mechanism described in [RFC7515] to support deployments in which JOSE is preferred over CMS. In addition to explaining how the format is created, MIME types are registered and examples are provided.</t>
