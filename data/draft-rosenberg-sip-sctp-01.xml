      <t>This document specifies a mechanism for usage of SCTP (the Stream Control Transmisson Protocol) as the transport between SIP entities. SCTP is a new protocol which provides several features that may prove beneficial for transport between SIP entities which exchange a large amount of messages, including gateways and proxies. As SIP is transport independent, support of SCTP is a relatively straightforward process, nearly identical to support for TCP.</t>
