    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines both a protocol for sending notifications over HTTPS as well as extensions to the data model for configured subscriptions defined in RFC 8639. It also presents an example module for configuration without using the data model defined in RFC 8639. This document requires that the publisher is a "server" (e.g., a NETCONF or RESTCONF server), but does not assume that the receiver is a server.</t>
