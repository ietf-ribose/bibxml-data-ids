      <t>This document considers control of photonic plugs in devices with packet functions from an architecture perspective. Three specific control solution deployment strategies are examined: * network technology partitioned domain controllers, with an orchestrator (higher level controller) to coordinate the domain controllers * single controller dealing with all network technologies * single control fabric in which components, from various vendors, each focused on a specific control function, interact as peers to provide holistic control of the network For all of the examined control solution deployment strategies, the control functions specializing in photonics determine the photonic network setup on-going and these control functions directly control the photonics of the network including the photonic plugs in devices with packet functions. There is a clear separation of concerns between packet function control and photonic function control such that the control can be partitioned so that control functions specializing in control of the packet network can control corresponding functions in the device with packet functions with no interference from the photonic control functions and vice versa.
