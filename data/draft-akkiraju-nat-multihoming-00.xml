    <abstract>
      <t>Multihoming to upstream ISPs is a requirement today for most networks in the Internet. The most common motivation to multihome is for reliable, non-stop access to the Internet. However, Multihoming creates scaling problems for the global routing infrastructure by making route aggregation more difficult for multihomed networks. Multihoming also complicates the addressing scheme used by the network. Another requirement for multihomed networks is the ability to load balance traffic between the multiple links to upstream ISPs. This requirement is difficult to fulfill for traffic flow in both directions as the multihomed network has no control over the return path of the packet.</t>
