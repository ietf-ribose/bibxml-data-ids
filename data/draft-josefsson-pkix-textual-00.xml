      <t>This document describe and discuss the text encodings of Public-Key Infrastructure using X.509 (PKIX) Certificates, PKIX Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs), PKCS #10 Certificate Request Syntax, PKCS #7 structures, and Attribute Certificates. The text encodings are well- known, implemented by several applications and libraries, and is widely deployed. This document is intended to articulate the de- facto rules that existing implementations operate by, and to give recommendations that will promote interoperability going forward.</t>
