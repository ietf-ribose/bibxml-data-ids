      <t>The Internet provides the ability for information to be spread beyond geographical boundaries at the speed of light. Once information is available over the Internet it leaves the private realm. If the information can be used to identify a person it can affect the privacy of the individual. There are cases when it can increase the physical risk to the individual or where it can have a negative financial impact. Some types of information can be an embarassment to an individual and negatively affect the person's reputation. This document discusses about identifiers in the context of privacy.</t>
