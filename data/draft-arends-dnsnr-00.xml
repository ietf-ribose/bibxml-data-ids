      <t>This document describes the DNSNR Resource Record (RR) for the Non-Repudiation (NR) of Existence service in the context of the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC). The DNSNR is an alternative to NSEC or "Authenticated Denial of Existence" Resource Records. A signed DNSNR RR protects security-aware DNS components against false denial of existence of RRsets by providing the RR types that exist for its ownername, which optionally includes a non-authoritative delegation point NS RR type. Labels in the ownername and the RDATA may be a hash-value as a defense against zone traversal.</t>
