      <t>This document describes a mechanism to enhance IPsec traffic flow security (IP-TFS) by adding Traffic Flow Confidentiality (TFC) to encrypted IP encapsulated traffic. TFC is provided by obscuring the size and frequency of IP traffic using a fixed-sized, constant-send- rate IPsec tunnel. The solution allows for congestion control as well as non-constant send-rate usage. The mechanisms defined in this document are generic with the intent of allowing for non-TFS uses, but such uses are outside the scope of this document.</t>
