      <t>Simple Traversal of UDP Through NATs (STUN) is a lightweight protocolthat allows applications to discover the presence and types ofNetwork Address Translators (NATs) and firewalls between them and thepublic Internet. It also provides the ability for applications todetermine the public IP addresses allocated to them by the nat. STUNworks with nearly all existing NATs, and does not require any specialbehavior from them. As a result, it allows a wide variety ofapplications to work through existing NAT infrastructure. The STUNprotocol is very simple, being almost identical to echo.</t>
