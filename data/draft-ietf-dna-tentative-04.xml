      <t>The proposed IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) Optimization"Optimistic DAD" defines a set of recoverable procedures which allowa node to make use of an address before DAD completes. Essentially,Optimistic DAD forbids usage of certain Neighbour Discovery optionswhich could pollute active neighbour cache entries, while an addressis tentative.This document defines a new option and procedures to replace cachepolluting options, in a way which is useful to tentative nodes.These procedures are designed to be to backward compatible withexisting devices which support IPv6 Neighbour Discovery.</t>
