      <t>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) defines an extension tothe offer/answer model used by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).This extension allows endpoints to traverse firewalls and NATs.However, in cases where highly restrictive firewalls exist, or wherenetwork failures have occurred, ICE may not be able to successfullyfind a media path. This document provides an error response codethat can be used with SIP in these cases.</t>
