      <t>Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) defines an extension to the offer/answer model used by the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). This extension allows endpoints to traverse firewalls and NATs. However, in cases where highly restrictive firewalls exist, or where network failures have occurred, ICE may not be able to successfully find a media path. This document provides an error response code that can be used with SIP in these cases.</t>
