    <abstract>
      <t>The IETFâ€™s work has significance for wider societal, economic, and political communities, though gaps and barriers to engagement with the IETF exist for policy experts. This informational draft introduces a problem statement and gap analysis of existing initiatives related to policy expert engagement in the IETF. It also poses questions we hope to work through with others in the IETF community regarding how to better enable policy expert engagement in IETF standardisation, and on how we can build a culture which better supports technical and policy experts working together to develop more robust standards.</t>
