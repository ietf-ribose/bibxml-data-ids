    <abstract>
      <t>The Media over QUIC system allows relays to assist in the delivery of real-time media. While these relays are trusted to facilitate media delivery, they are not trusted to access the media content. The document describes an end-to-end security system that prevents relays from accessing media content. MLS is used to establish keys that are available only to legitimate participants in a session, which are then used to protect media data using SFrame.</t>
