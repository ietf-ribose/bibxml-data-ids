    <abstract>
      <t>MPLS systems will be used in core networks where system downtime must be kept to an absolute minimum. Many MPLS LSRs may, therefore, exploit Fault Tolerant (FT) hardware or software to provide high-availability of the core networks. The details of how FT is achieved for the various components of an FT LSR, including LDP, CR-LDP, the switching hardware and TCP, are implementation specific. This document identifies issues in the CR-LDP specification [2] and the LDP specification [4] that make it difficult to implement an FT LSR using the current LDP and CR-LDP protocols, and proposes enhancements to the LDP specification to ease such FT LSR implementations. The extensions described here are equally applicable to CR-LDP.</t>
