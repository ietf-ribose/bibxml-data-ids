    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies requirements for a QoE-driven transport system, which enables network stack to adjust its transport strategy according to the QoE intent expressed by applications. The Application Layer MUST provide a structured QoE Intent Signal detailing performance objectives to the transport layer. A QoE Mapping Engine is required to translate this intent into adaptive transport strategies. The Transport Protocol Stack SHOULD continuously feed a Transport Feedback Signal on current performance and network status back to the Application Layer, thereby closing the control loop essential for continuous QoE optimization.</t>
