      <t>This document specifies the payload format for encapsulating X-protocol streams in the Realtime Transport Protocol (RTP). This specification is intended for X-protocol media streams that are not already handled by other RTP payload specifications. This specification gives details of the payload format of X-protocol data requests that are carried over RTP/UDP/IP in a shared window session. Multiple X protocol requests can be carried over an RTP packet as well as one X protocol request can be carried over multiple RTP packets. a shared window header is defined within the RTP payload to carry X protocol media requests. An RTCP join and RTP reply packets are specified to allow a latecomer to join an on-going session. This specification is intended for streaming stored X Window protocol data as well as live X protocol data requests.</t>
