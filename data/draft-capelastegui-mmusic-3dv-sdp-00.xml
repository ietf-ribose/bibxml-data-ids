      <t>This document defines a mechanism to describe 3D video streams in the Session Description Protocol (SDP). This includes 3D video streams composed of multiple video views, or of a combination of views and depth maps. Several 3D video formats are supported, including simulcast, video-plus-depth, and frame-packing. A new decoding dependency, "3dd", is defined, describing the association between media stream belonging to a 3D video stream. In addition, a new SDP media-level attribute, "3dvFormat", is defined, describing the format used by media streams within a 3D video stream.</t>
