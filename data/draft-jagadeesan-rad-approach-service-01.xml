      <t>This memo suggest a radical and a generic approach in using the 20-bit IPv6 Flow label field to provide Quality-of-Service on the Internet. The approach is generic in the sense that it does not enforce any specific implementation features on the developers; the only thing that will have specific semantics is the flow-label field. The methods of information storage and processing in the routers are router specific and can be implemented in a number of ways. Thus the resulting mechanism suggested here is fully and easily implementable and unambiguous as may be required for real implementations.</t>
