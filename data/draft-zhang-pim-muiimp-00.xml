    <abstract>
      <t>In this document, followed by the idea mentioned in [4] and subsequent update in [5], an IGMP/MLD proxy with multiple upstream interfaces called MUIIMP is proposed and analyzed. The MUIIMP inherits the basic rule of the IGMP/MLD proxy but extends with multiple upstream interfaces. To avoid data redundancy, each upstream interface of an MUIIMP device MUST NOT send or subscribe the same data simultaneously.</t>
