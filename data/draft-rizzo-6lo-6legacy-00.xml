      <t>IPv6 is an important enabler of the Internet of Things, since it provides an addressing space large enough to encompass a vast and ubiquitous set of sensors and devices, allowing them to interconnect and interact seamlessly. Many of those devices presently are based on networking technologies other than IP. In order to include them into an IPv6 based Internet of Things, a mechanism for assigning an IPv6 address to each of them is required. The only existing proposal for a standard way of assigning an IPv6 address to devices which do not support IPv6 or IPv4, is very generic, it leaves many problems unsolved and it is nowadays inadequate to cope with the new scenarios opened by the Internet of Things. This document defines a mechanism, 6TONon-IP, for assigning automatically an IPv6 address to devices which do not support IPv6 or IPv4, in a way which minimizes the chances of address conflicts, and of frequent configuration changes due to instability of connection among devices. Such a mapping mechanism enables stateless autoconfiguration for legacy technology devices, allowing them to to interconnect through the Internet and to fully integrate into a world wide scale IPv6 IoT.</t>
