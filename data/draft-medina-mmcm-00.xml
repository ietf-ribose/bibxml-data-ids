      <t>This document defines a mark and drop mechanism called Multimedia Color Marker or mmCM. This mechanism, based on the Three Color Marker [trTCM], can be used as a component of a Diffserv traffic conditioner for CBR Audio/Video flows. In addition to the functions performed by a color aware trTCM, the mmCM performs rate control and reactive discard. Rate control protects TCP flows from unresponsive UDP streams. Rate control is performed by introducing a third Token Bucket to the trTCM model with a small bucket size. Reactive discard is used to increase the probability of delivery for low precedence packets. Reactive discard is performed by demoting or dropping yellow and red packets in reaction to a green packet demotion at the marker. Hierarchically coded Audio/Video flows can benefit of this functionality if the coder pre-marks the stream to reflect the relative value of the information transported in each IP packet. It is assumed that the mmCM is used in conjunction with AF-based services.</t>
