      <t>This document extends Directory-Based Information Services (DBIS) described in [draft-bannister-dbis-mapping-00] to support ethers and bootparams databases. The database schemas SHALL be backwards compatible with the Network Information Service [NIS] but stored within [X.500] entries so that they may be resolved with the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [RFC4510]. An ethers database maps 48-bit Ethernet addresses to IP addresses or host names, and bootparams maps hosts to boot-time kernel parameters. This document describes LDAP object classes and attributes required to extend hosts entries [draft-bannister-dbis-hosts-00] to support parameters for ethers and bootparams maps.</t>
