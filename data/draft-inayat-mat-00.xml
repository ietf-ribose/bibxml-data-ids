      <t>This document describes MAT, a mobile network architecture that allowssmooth node mobility in wireless IP networks without using any packetintercepter/forwarder. The mobility solution is specifically designedfor time-sensitive real-time applications, particularly the applicationswhere payload tends to be short and packet header overhead is verysignificant. Connections are established as per permanent addresses ofthe nodes but are carried on by the IP layer according to the temporaryaddresses by address translation at the end nodes. The mappinginformation is maintained by database servers, which can be placed inthe Internet in a distributed manner. TCP connections and securityassociations can be preserved even if the node moves to another subnetor the node changes its active interface in a multi-homed environmentwithout modifying TCP or IPsec. In comparison with Mobile IPv4 andIPv6, MAT has several advantages in terms of header overhead and faulttolerance.</t>
