This document attempts toidentify a set of criteria for evaluating such mechanisms. Thecriteria could be used by IETF for evaluating a VPN proposal beforeadvancing it to standard track or by VPN Service Providers orenterprise network administrators for choosing which mechanism to usein order to implement their desired VPN networks.
