      <t>A communication network includes an access network element that delivers data to/from the user and an associated core network element that typically is the IP gateway having connectivity with the application servers. Multiconnectivity scenarios are common where a device can be simultaneously connected to multiple communication networks based on different technology implementations and network architectures like WiFi, LTE, DSL. A smart combination and selection of access and core network paths can improve quality of experience that a user in a multiconnectivity scenario. This document presents the problem statement and proposes solution principles. It specifies the requirements and reference architecture for a multi access management services framework that can be used to flexibly select the best combination of uplink and downlink access and core network paths, ensuring better network efficiency and enhanced application performance.</t>
