    <abstract>
      <t>In this document, we introduce a method to establish backup LSP tunnels in large-scale networks. Two additional RSVP objects are proposed. These objects together make possible for routers using RSVP to create detours that can route around downstream links and nodes. As a result, an LSP can quickly and automatically repair itself, while redirecting the user traffic to the pre-computed and pre- established detour routes in event of network link and node failures. Packet loss is therefore minimized.</t>
