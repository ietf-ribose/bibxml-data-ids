    <abstract>
      <t>ID/Location separation protocols are proposed for scalable routing, enhancing mobility and privacy in IP based internet infrastructure. When we consider IP based vehicular networks, ID/Location separation architecture is expected to offer benefits. In this draft, we analyze whether ID/Location separation protocols can adjust into IP based vehicular networks and solve requirements.</t>
