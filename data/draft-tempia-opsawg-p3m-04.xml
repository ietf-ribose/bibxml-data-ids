      <t>This document describes a passive method to perform packet loss, delay and jitter measurements on live traffic. Implementation and deployment details are also explained in order to clarify how the tools and features currently available on existing routing platforms can be used to implement the method. This method has been invented and engineered in Telecom Italia and it's currently being used in Telecom Italia's network.</t>
