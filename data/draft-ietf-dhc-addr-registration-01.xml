    <abstract>
      <t>In networks that are centrally managed, self-generated addresses cause traceability issues due to their decentralized nature. To minimize the issues due to lack of traceability, these self-generated addresses can be registered with the network for allowing centralized address administration. This document defines a generic address registration solution using DHCPv6, using a new ND option and a new DHCPv6 option in order to communicate the use of self-generated addresses.</t>
