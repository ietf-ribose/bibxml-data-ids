    <abstract>
      <t>John Klensin proposed a multi-layered search-based access model for the DNS to address more human-friendly naming and navigation need of the modern Internet [DNSSEARCH]. When deploying the DNS search system in the global Internet, stability and scalability are two most important factors no matter what protocol we finally use. This draft demonstrates that caching is a significant objective for a stable and scalable DNS search system. Particularly, this document analyzes statistical operational data collected from our Keyword service. The collected data clearly demonstrates the potential high impact of caching in the resolution process. Based on deployment experience, the document describes alternative caching methods. From there, basic caching requirements for DNS Search systems are discussed. The goal of this document is not to propose some standard caching mechanisms or methods but to emphasize the necessity of caching for DNS Search systems. Furthermore, the authors believe that the proven high efficiency of caching should be an important consideration when designing the future lookup protocol for such systems.</t>
