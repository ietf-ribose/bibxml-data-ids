    <abstract>
      <t>This document presents an architectural framework for an Intelligent Agent Communication Gateway (Agent-GW), designed to support large- scale, heterogeneous, and dynamic multi-agent collaboration. As agents evolve from isolated software entities to a collaborative digital workforce, the underlying infrastructure must transition from rigid, host-based connectivity to flexible, intent-based interaction. This document outlines the requirements for such a transition and proposes the Agent-GW as a unified infrastructure hub. The gateway provides native primitives for Semantic Routing—dispatching tasks based on intent and capability—and Working Memory, which manages structured context for multi-step workflows. Furthermore, it defines mechanisms for automated protocol adaptation, oracle-free agent evaluation, and collaborative inference acceleration (KDN). The architecture aims to enable agents and legacy systems to interoperate through standardized protocols while ensuring observability, security, and operational scalability.</t>
