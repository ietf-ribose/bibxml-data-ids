      <t>As each global IPv4 address will be shared among more and morecustomers, and as more and more NATs will be deployed in ISPinfrastructures, the lack of end-to-end transparency and the limitedscalability of some NATs are likely to cause increasing difficultiesto customers and to ISPs. This document introduces IPv4-IPv6coexistence scenarios where IPv4 addresses are shared with goodscalability and, in favorable configurations, with full IPv4 end-to-end transparency. For this, the key tool is the Stateless AddressMapping (SAM) of draft-despres-SAM-00, with in particular itsextended IPv4 addressing (IPv4E) in which port prefixes are used asIPv4 address extensions. For each considered scenario, StaticAddress Mappers (SAMs) are deployed at scenario specific places.</t>
