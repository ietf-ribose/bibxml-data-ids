      <t>This document describes a protocol to negotiate and subsequently usetunnels on demand, and the use of such tunnels to achieve scalablemultihoming. The tunnels may run over either IPv4 or IPv6 transport,and the payload may consist of any upper layer protocol that can beused with IPv4 or IPv6. Tunnels are defined end-to-end, which meansthat a single outer or 'locator' address pair maps to a single inneror 'identifier' address pair. In order to avoid unnecessaryoverhead, tunneled packets (in the absence of option headers) onlycarry an outer header, an upper layer header and payload data. Thereis no inner header containing the original addresses; thisinformation is reconstituted from the state associated with thetunnel where required. Additional mechanisms are used to provide basic security for themapping between inner and outer addresses and to avoid unnecessaryoverhead and delays for short-lived sessions, and to facilitaterehoming in the event of a reachability problem. This document is a first draft, and as such doesn't contain a fullprotocol specification as higher-level changes are expected.</t>
