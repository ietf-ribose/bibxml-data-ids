      <t>This document suggests some possible areas for extending the IETF 'conneg' working group's capability description framework, described in [2,3,4]. The suggested areas for extension have been motivated by WWW Consortium (W3C) work on Composite Capability/Preference Profiles (CCPP) [5] that parallels some aspects of the IETF 'conneg' work. This is presented as a discussion document, with a view to maybe integrating some of these ideas into ongoing 'conneg' work, and to indicate some areas for ongoing collaboration between the IETF and W3C in the area of content description.</t>
