      <t>The Source Routing-based Multicast Protocol (SRMP) is designed to provide multicast functionality in mobile ad hoc networks. It appliesthe source routing mechanism defined by the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) [1] in a modified manner decreasing the size of the packetheader. SRMP obtains multicast routes on-demand through constructinga mesh (an arbitrary subnet) to connect group members providing robustness against mobility.</t>
