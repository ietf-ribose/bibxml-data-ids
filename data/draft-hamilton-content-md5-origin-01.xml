      <t>The Content-MD5: header specified in RFC 1864 has not been widely deployed, though this would be highly desirable for a number of reasons. The author conjectures that this lack of usage is due at least in part to the requirement that only originating user agents may add a Content-MD5: header. This proposal updates RFC 1864 to remove that requirement, and defines the header Content-MD5-Origin: for use by relaying hosts to indicate the point at which a Content- MD5: header was added.</t>
