      <t>The ROCCO header compression scheme [ROCCO] has been designed to compress the RTP/UDP/IP headers in an reliable, efficient and robust way also when used over links with high error rates and long round trip times, such as cellular links. This document evaluates the performance of ROCCO in such environments. It also summarizes how the scheme fulfills the requirements for a new RTP/UDP/IP compression scheme, as stated by the ROHC working group.</t>
