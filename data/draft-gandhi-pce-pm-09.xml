    <abstract>
      <t>In certain networks, network performance data such as packet loss, delay and delay variation as well as bandwidth utilization is a critical measure for Traffic Engineering (TE). This data provides operators the characteristics of their networks for performance evaluation that is required to ensure the Service Level Agreements (SLAs). The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) provides mechanisms for Path Computation Elements (PCEs) to perform path computations in response to Path Computation Clients (PCCs') requests. The Stateful PCE extensions allow Stateful control of Traffic Engineering Paths using PCEP for both RSVP and Segment Routing (SR). This document describes PCEP extensions for enabling and reporting end-to-end performance measurements for both PCE-Initiated and PCC- Initiated LSPs for both RSVP-TE and SR-TE (for MPLS and IPv6 Data planes) to an Active Stateful PCE.</t>
