      <t>This memo is the specification of the code page, which was originally developed for the transmission of texts in the Ukrainian language through networks, and in particular the networks, employing Unix operating systems. It is, however, operating-system-neutral, and is used in various situations, just as its Russian language counterpart KOI-8R. With some minor exceptions, this specification can be considered to be an extension of KOI8-R (RFC-1489). The present edition of the specification is the result of the wide concensus reached after many prolonged exchanges and discussions, which took place in Ukraine and on some Usenet conferences covering Ukraine and read by the public who employs the Ukrainian language.</t>
