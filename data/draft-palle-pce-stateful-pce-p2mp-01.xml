    <abstract>
      <t>The Path Computation Element (PCE) has been identified as an appropriate technology for the determination of the paths of point- to-multipoint (P2MP) TE LSPs. [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce-app] presents several use cases, demonstrating scenarios that benefit from the deployment of a stateful PCE. [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] provides the fundamental PCE communication Protocol (PCEP) extensions needed to support stateful PCE functions. This memo provides extensions required for PCEP so as to enable the usage of a stateful PCE capability in supporting point-to-multipoint (P2MP) TE LSPs.</t>
