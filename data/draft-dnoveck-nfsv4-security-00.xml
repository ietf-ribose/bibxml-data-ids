      <t>This document describes the core security features of the NFSv4 family of protocols, applying to all minor versions. The discussion includes the use of security features provided at the RPC transport level. This prelimimary version of the document, is intended, in large part, to result in working group discussion regarding NFSv4 security issues and ientify issues on which the working group needs to work on achieving consensus. When published as an RFC, it will supersede the description of security appearing in existing minor version specification documents such as RFC 7530 and RFC 8881.</t>
