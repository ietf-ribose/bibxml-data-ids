      <t>Motivated by the need to find and evaluate better ways for reaching on-line content in upcoming Future Internet environments, ICN has been increasingly deployed in an broad range of research and experimental actions. Some deployments even go as far as subjecting ICN to new scenarios beyond content-reaching, exposing the flexibility of ICN core primitives in supporting such mechanisms. In this sense, besides analyzing and discussing the role of network management procedures in ICN environments, this document also analyzes possibilities on how intrinsic core ICN mechanisms can be reutilized for network management. We consider that the availability of management mechanisms for ICN will foster their deployment and, as such, should be tackled still in the design and experimentation phases. Perhaps ICN can adapt successful mechanisms from the host- centric paradigm, or new network management schemes can be designed. Perhaps even both. This document centralizes that discussion, drawing the attention of the ICNRG community to this underdeveloped area of research in ICN.</t>
