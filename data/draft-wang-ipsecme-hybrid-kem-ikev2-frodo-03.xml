    <abstract>
      <t>Multiple key exchanges in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) [RFC9370] specifies a framework, which supports multiple key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) in IKEv2 by allowing up to 7 layers of additional KEMs to derive the final shared secret keys for IPsec protocols. The primary goal is to mitigate the “harvest now and decrypt later” threat posed by Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers(CRQCs). For this purpose, one or more post-quantum KEMs are usually performed in addition to the traditional (EC)DH key exchange. This draft specifies how the post-quantum KEM algorithm FrodoKEM is instantiated for IKEv2 as an additional key exchange mechanism. [EDNOTE: IANA KE code points for FrodoKEM may need to be assigned, as the code points for ML-KEM has been considered in [W-D.K25]. ]</t>
