      <t>This memo utilizes IPPM metrics that are applicable to both complete paths and sub-paths, and defines relationships to compose a complete path metric from the sub-path metrics with some accuracy w.r.t. the actual metrics. This is called Spatial Composition in RFC 2330. The current version of the memo gives some background and proposes wording for a Scope and Application section to define this new work. The description of several example metrics and statistics follow.</t>
