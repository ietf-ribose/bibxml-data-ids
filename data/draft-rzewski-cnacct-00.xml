      <t>One of the goals of 'content peering' is to allow content providers to receive detailed information on the utilization of their content in remote networks. In order to provide this, a simple, commonly accepted log format must be used on systems that deliver content. Also, a commonly accepted mechanism is required to pass these logs between networks. This draft proposes a log format and log passing mechanism specifically for HTTP content.</t>
