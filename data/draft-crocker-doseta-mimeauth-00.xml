      <t>MIME is a method of packaging and labeling aggregations of data; itis used both for email and the Web. Many usage scenarios wouldbenefit by having an objective method of assessing the validity ofMIME data, based on an authenticated identity. MIMEAUTH leveragestechnology developed for DKIM to provide such a method. Its use canbe extended to cover specific header-fields of a containing emailmessage or World Wide Web HTTP content. Existing authenticationmechanisms have achieved only limited success due to challenges withadministration and use. MIMEAUTH has very low administration and useoverhead, through self-certifying keys in the DNS and a labelingmethod that can be transparent to end-users. For relayed andmediated sequences, MIMEAUTH can be implemented within a service andtherefore can be transparent to end-system software.</t>
