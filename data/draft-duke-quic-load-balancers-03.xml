    <abstract>
      <t>QUIC connection IDs allow continuation of connections across address/ port 4-tuple changes, and can store routing information for stateless or low-state load balancers. They also can prevent linkability of connections across deliberate address migration through the use of protected communications between client and server. This creates issues for load-balancing intermediaries. This specification standardizes methods for encoding routing information and proposes an optional protocol called QUIC_LB to exchange the parameters of that encoding.</t>
