      <t>This document drafts a proposal of Computing Delivery in Routing Network which incorporates both computing and networking metrics into the routing polices and enables the network sensing and scheduling computing services based upon traditional networking services. A mechanism of two-class computing power granularity and two segment forwarding is illustrated for end-to-end networking and computing service in the cloud sites, while major networking and computing actors is defined in terms of functionality. An example work flow is demonstrated, and both control plane and data plane solution consideration is proposed.</t>
