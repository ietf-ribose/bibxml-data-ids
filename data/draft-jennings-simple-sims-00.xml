      <t>This document defines a protocol for conveying binary MIME content innear-real time, peer-to-peer or through one or more relays, with theopportunity for store and forward. SIMS (SIMPLE Instant MessagingSessions) can be used as a standalone protocol, or in conjunction witha rendezvous or session setup protocol such as SIP.While SIMS was originally envisioned as an alternative to the MediaSession Relay Protocol (MSRP), one section of this document describeshow these ideas could be applied as MSRP extensions for features suchas chunking, relay connection multiplexing, and prevention ofhead-of-line blocking.</t>
