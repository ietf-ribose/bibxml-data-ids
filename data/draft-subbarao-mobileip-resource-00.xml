      <t>Currently, in Mobile IP when an MN moves from one FA to another FA/CoA, relevant resources at the previous FA are consumed until its visitor entry for the MN expires. The Resource Release Message and Resource Management Extension described in this draft will facilitate the release of these valuable resources at the previous FA as the MN moves to a new location. The HA notifies the previous FA of any changes in the CoA for an MN, thereby allowing the FA to release its resources.</t>
