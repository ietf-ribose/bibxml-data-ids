      <t>The SPIRITS protocol defines the mechanisms and the semantics tosubscribe to and convey certain PSTN events to interested Internethosts for service execution [1]. This Internet-Draft describes ourinitial implementation of a SPIRITS framework based on thearchitecture and requirements outlined in [2] and [3], respectively.We have implemented two services based on such an architecture: aSPIRITS-based presence service which provides a coarse-grainedpresence status for a user represented by a device (phone), and aSPIRITS-based Instant Messaging (IM) service whereby the PSTN sends aSIP IM to a SPIRITS User Agent (UA). These services, the attendantarchitecture and the relevant call flows are described next.It is expected that the reader is conversant in the SPIRITS and SIPterminology. For those who are not, [5,6] provide a good referencefor SIP and its event-based mechanism, and [1,2,3] provide a goodreference for SPIRITS.It is important to point out that the SPIRITS protocol [1] is not astandard yet, it is still an Internet-Draft. Thus, what is describedin this draft is an early implementation designed to validate thesuitability of the protocol as well as provide some implementationexperience that will be leveraged in further refining the protocol.</t>
