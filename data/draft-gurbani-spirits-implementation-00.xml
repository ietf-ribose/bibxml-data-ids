      <t>The SPIRITS protocol defines the mechanisms and the semantics to subscribe to and convey certain PSTN events to interested Internet hosts for service execution [1]. This Internet-Draft describes our initial implementation of a SPIRITS framework based on the architecture and requirements outlined in [2] and [3], respectively. We have implemented two services based on such an architecture: a SPIRITS-based presence service which provides a coarse-grained presence status for a user represented by a device (phone), and a SPIRITS-based Instant Messaging (IM) service whereby the PSTN sends a SIP IM to a SPIRITS User Agent (UA). These services, the attendant architecture and the relevant call flows are described next. It is expected that the reader is conversant in the SPIRITS and SIP terminology. For those who are not, [5,6] provide a good reference for SIP and its event-based mechanism, and [1,2,3] provide a good reference for SPIRITS. It is important to point out that the SPIRITS protocol [1] is not a standard yet, it is still an Internet-Draft. Thus, what is described in this draft is an early implementation designed to validate the suitability of the protocol as well as provide some implementation experience that will be leveraged in further refining the protocol.</t>
