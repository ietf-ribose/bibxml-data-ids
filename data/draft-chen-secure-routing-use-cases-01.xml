    <abstract>
      <t>Current routing mechanism based on the shortest path, only the path accessibility is considered, but the security of links and forwarding nodes is not considered. As security has become an important factor in the service layer. this paper proposes to add a new factor: security. The frequent occurrence of security incidents, users' demand for security services is essential. As there are many security devices in the ISP's network, this draft proposes secure routing, the purpose of secure routing is to converge security and routing to ensure the security of the transmission process. The scope is transmission process security, while end-to-end security and application layer security are out of scope.</t>
