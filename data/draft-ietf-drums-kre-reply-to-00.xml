      <t>This draft forms part of a discussion on the appropriate use of the Reply-To header in e-mail messages. This draft argues for one particular proposed definition of the Reply-To header. It is not intended that this document ever become anything more than an Internet-Draft. If adopted, the text here, or a modified version of some parts of it, would be merged into the proposed replacement for RFC822.</t>
