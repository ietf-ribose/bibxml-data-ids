      <t>This document motivates the need for a forwarding-label which is another name that can be used in forwarding, in addition to the mandatory name in a CCNx Interest message. Forwarding-label once inserted by a edge router can be modified en-route towards the producer. Forwarding-label can be used for several purposes such as to support routing scalability, producer mobility, multi-protocol support, or for fast forwarding. We describe its encoding format, and rules followed by a forwarder while processing it. We also illustrate its use by applying it towards producer mobility. This draft scopes the use of forwarding-label within a closed trusted domain, while the use of it by applications is not ruled out.</t>
