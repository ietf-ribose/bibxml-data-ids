      <t>Karn's algorithm specifies acknowledgements that are theresult of segment retransmits should be ignored, not timed,and should not contribute to the smoothed round-trip-time(SRTT) because they are considered "ambiguous". It is alsostated in Karn's paper that "If an acknowledgement arrivesafter the RTO has expired, it is highly likely to come veryshortly after wards." In time, we have added the "fast retransmit"functionality, so we are not solely dependent on RTO forretransmits. Common sense dictates that if we receive anacknowledgement "very shortly after wards", that thoseacknowledgments should not be considered "ambiguous". Thesenon-ambiguous acknowledgments should be added to the SRTT andtrigger us to return to our previous non-congestion behavior.</t>
