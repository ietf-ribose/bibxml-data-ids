    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides methods and settings for using IPv6 to communicate among IPv6 nodes within the communication range of one another over 5G V2X (i.e., the 5th Generation Vehicle-to-Everything) links. Support for these methods and settings require minimal changes to the existing IPv6 protocol stack. This document also describes limitations associated with using these methods. Optimizations and usage of IPv6 in more complex 5G scenarios are not covered in this specification and are a subject for future work.</t>
