      <t>A case against IP layer fragmentation has been made, and various methods for avoiding it proposed. This memo revisits the effect of fragmentation on network performance, and recounts the present methods of avoidance. A protocol is presented which adapts to the varying circumstances encountered, sending large datagrams whenever possible, and reducing fragmentation when necessary to avoid retransmission problems. A hybrid approach to MTU discovery, it utilizes one new IP header option and four new ICMP messages. It is a simple mechanism that discovers path MTUs without wasting resources and that works well before all hosts and routers are modified.</t>
