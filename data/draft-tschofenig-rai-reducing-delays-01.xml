    <abstract>
      <t>During the last year, participants in the Real-time Applications and Infrastructure (RAI) area have been quite active in discussing proposals that could improve their way of working. This document is a contribution to that discussion and focuses on the reduction of delays experienced in producing specifications. We believe that this is one of the main problems in the RAI area (and quite likely in other areas of the IETF as well) and it requires attention. A number of side effects, caused by the long specification work, are illustrated in this document.</t>
