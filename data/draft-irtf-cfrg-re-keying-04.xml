      <t>A certain maximum amount of data can be safely encrypted when encryption is performed under a single key. This amount is called "key lifetime". This specification describes a variety of methods to increase the lifetime of symmetric keys. It provides external and internal re-keying mechanisms based on hash functions and on block ciphers, that can be used with modes of operations such as CTR, GCM, CCM, CBC, CFB, OFB and OMAC.</t>
