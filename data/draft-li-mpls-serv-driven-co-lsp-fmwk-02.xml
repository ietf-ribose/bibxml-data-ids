      <t>MPLS TE has been widely deployed to provide traffic engineering and traffic protection. The complexity in configuration has much effect on the MPLS TE deployment in the large-scale network. The document identifies the configuration issues for MPLS TE deployment and proposes a new mechanism, the service-driven mechanism, by which the setup of co-routed MPLS TE LSPs is triggered by the bidirectional service. Then the document provides the framework for setting up service-driven co-routed MPLS Traffic-Engineered Label-Switched Paths(TE LSPs) for L2VPN and L3VPN.</t>
