      <t>This Internet Draft describes an extension to the SMTP Services which will enable an SMTP Server/Client to check the Integrity of Mails received by it and immediately request for the Mail to be resent if it is found to be corrupted during that particular transaction. This extension is meant to apply to both SMTP Clients and Servers as described in detail below.</t>
