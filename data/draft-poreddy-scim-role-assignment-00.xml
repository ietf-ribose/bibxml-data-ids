    <abstract>
      <t>SCIM 2.0 defines "roles" and "entitlements" attributes on the User resource, but it lacks a standardized way to bind roles to specific scopes such as projects, tenants, or groups. This gap forces organizations to rely on group sprawl or non-standard encodings, preventing true interoperability. This document introduces a new SCIM resource type, _RoleAssignment_, which models scoped role bindings as first-class records, enabling portable provisioning, lifecycle governance, and compliance visibility.</t>
