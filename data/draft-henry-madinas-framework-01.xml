      <t>To limit the association between a device traffic and its user, client vendors have started implementing MAC address rotation. When such rotation happens, some in-network states may break, which may affect network efficiency and the user experience. At the same time, devices may continue sending other stable identifiers, defeating the MAC rotation purposes. This document lists various network environements and a set of network services that may be affected by such rotation. This docuemnt then examines settings where the user experience may be affected by in-network state disruption, and settings where other machine identifiers may expose the user privacy. Last, this document examines solutions to maintain user privacy while preserving user quality of experience and network operation efficiency.</t>
