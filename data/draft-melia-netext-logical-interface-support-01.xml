      <t>A Logical Interface is a software semantic internal to the hostoperating system. This semantic is available in all popularoperating systems and is used in various protocol implementations.The Logical Interface support is desirable on the mobile nodeoperating in a Proxy Mobile IPv6 domain, for leveraging variousnetwork-based mobility management features such as inter-technologyhandoffs, multihoming and flow mobility support. This documentexplains the operational details of Logical Interface construct andthe specifics on how the link-layer implementations hide the physicalinterfaces from the IP stack and from the network nodes.Furthermore, this document identifies the applicability of thisapproach to various link-layer technologies and analyses the issuesaround it when used in context with various mobility managementfeatures.</t>
