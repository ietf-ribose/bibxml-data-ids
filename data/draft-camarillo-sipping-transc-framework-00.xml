      <t>This document defines a framework for transcoding with SIP. This framework includes how to discover the need of transcoding services in a session and how to invoke those transcoding services. Two models for transcoding services invocation are discussed; the conference bridge model and the third party call control model. Both models meet the requirements for SIP regarding transcoding services invocation to support deaf, hard of hearing and speech-impaired individuals.</t>
