      <t>Internet Calendaring and Scheduling protocols require the definition of objects to encapsulate an event to be scheduled, a calendar on which the event will be stored, and means for exchanging these objects across the Internet between calendars on behalf of people for whom the calendars are meaningful. This document gives an abstract model of the objects and the protocols necessary to accomplish this kind of information exchange. It will establish the context in which other Calendaring and Scheduling RFCs can be interpreted. Included are brief introductions to the other components of Internet calendar protocols and definitions of nomenclature common to all documents defining these protocols. Reading this document will enable implementors and users of Internet Calendaring and Scheduling protocols to understand the goals and constraints chosen for related protocols.</t>
