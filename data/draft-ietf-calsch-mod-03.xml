This document gives an abstract model of theobjects and the protocols necessary to accomplish this kind ofinformation exchange. It will establish the context in which otherCalendaring and Scheduling RFCs can be interpreted. Included are briefintroductions to the other components of Internet calendar protocolsand definitions of nomenclature common to all documents defining theseprotocols.
