      <t>To provide a robust model for modifying documents and data within a distributed World Wide Web authoring environment, it is necessary to furnish a methodology which controls access to objects. Access control may include the ability to read an object, modify an object, or perform other more advanced functions upon an object. Access control is necessary to prevent unauthorized access or modification of objects within the authoring environment which could lead to unintended loss, damage or disclosure of data. This document proposes requirements for the support of access control within a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) environment. It describes a model for the representation and interpretation of access control policies, and a set of operations needed to manage policies in that form. It is intended that these requirements be supported within the framework of the proposed WebDAV extensions [WEBDAV1] to HTTP [HTTP], in the form of additional protocol operations and compliance requirements for clients and servers</t>
