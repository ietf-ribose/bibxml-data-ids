      <t>To provide a robust model for modifying documents and data within adistributed World Wide Web authoring environment, it is necessary tofurnish a methodology which controls access to objects. Access controlmay include the ability to read an object, modify an object, or performother more advanced functions upon an object. Access control isnecessary to prevent unauthorized access or modification of objectswithin the authoring environment which could lead to unintended loss,damage or disclosure of data. This document proposes requirements for the support of access controlwithin a Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) environment.It describes a model for the representation and interpretation of accesscontrol policies, and a set of operations needed to manage policies inthat form. It is intended that these requirements be supported withinthe framework of the proposed WebDAV extensions [WEBDAV1] to HTTP[HTTP], in the form of additional protocol operations and compliancerequirements for clients and servers</t>
