      <t>There are several applications that require symmetric MultiprotocolLabel Switching (MPLS) path between two points. This cannot beachieved with regular MPLS as the LSPs are unidirectional. Ifsymmetry is required, a separate LSP in each direction is requiredfor bidirectional traffic flow. Generalized MPLS on the other hand,has provisions for setting up a bidirectional LSP. This documentuses the extensions introduced for GMPLS and applies it to regularMPLS for establishing bidirectional LSPs. Additionally, it alsodescribes how bi-directional symmetrical Fast Reroute using both one-to-one and facility backup can be achieved.</t>
