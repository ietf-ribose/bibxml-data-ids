    <abstract>
      <t>Many solutions have been proposed to enable automatically switched transport networks (ASTN). This document describes a control plane architecture that can be applied to different packet and circuit switching technologies (including fiber, waveband, wavelength, PDH, and SONET/SDH). The control plane technology is based on IP/MPLS control plane protocols. As such, this document is based on the concepts introduced in [MPLambdas] and [GMPLS-SIG] from an architectural perspective. It also describes how this control plane architecture could facilitate control plane integration of networks across technical, administrative, and business domains. This memo includes generic procedures, key concepts, and technical considerations for the generalized MPLS control plane architecture. It is intended to accentuate understanding of the application domains, create architectural alignment, and serve as guide for protocol engineering.</t>
