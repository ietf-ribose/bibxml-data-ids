      <t>Layer 2 techniques based on IEEE 802.1Q bridges are in widespreaduse by Ethernet MAN Service Providers. It is possible to implementthe data plane functionality of Service Provider Backbone asdescribed in the framework draft [ANDERSSON] using bridges as theProvider Edge (PE) equipment. There are three small butsignificant changes to the [LASSERRE-VKOMPELLA] VPLS draft whichwould make the Service Provider Backbone much more compatible witha bridge-based PE implementation, and which would improve theefficiency of all L2VPN implementations.</t>
