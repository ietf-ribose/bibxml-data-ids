      <t>This document defines frame relay pseudo-wire emulation edge-to-edge. A frame relay pseudo-wire is a mechanism that exists between a provider's edge network nodes and support as faithfully as possible frame relay services over IP and MPLS packet switched network (PSN). Two mapping modes are defined: One-to-one mapping mode characterized by a one to one relationship between a frame relay VC and a pair of MPLS LSPs is defined for MPLS PSN. The other mode is known as port mode or many-to-one mapping mode and is defined for MPLS PSN and IP PSN with L2TPv3.</t>
