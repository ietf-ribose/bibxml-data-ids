      <t>The Fisheye State Routing (FSR) algorithm for ad hoc networks introduces the notion of multi-level 'scope' to reduce routing update overhead in large networks. A node stores the Link State for every destination in the network. It periodically broadcasts the Link State update of a destination to its neighbors with a frequency that depends on the hop distance to that destination (i.e., the 'scope' relative to that destination). State updates corresponding to far away destinations are propagated with lower frequency than those for close by destinations. From state updates, nodes construct the topology map of the entire network and compute efficient routes. The route on which the packet travels becomes progressively more accurate as the packet approaches its destination. FSR resembles Link State routing in that it propagates Link State updates. However, the updates are propagated as aggregates, periodically (with period dependent on distance) instead of being flooded individually from each source. FSR leads to major reduction in link O/H caused by routing table updates. It enhances scalability of large, mobile ad hoc networks.</t>
