      <t>This document specifies the file Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme that was originally specified in [RFC1738]. The purpose of this document is to keep the information about the scheme on standards track, since [RFC1738] has been made obsolete, and to promote interoperability by resolving disagreements between various implementations. Note to Readers This draft should be discussed on its github project page [github].</t>
