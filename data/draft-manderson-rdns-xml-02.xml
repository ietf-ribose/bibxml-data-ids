      <t>This document defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML) schema for reverse DNS management in a tightly controlled Representational State Transfer (REST) environment. This document describes a schema that has been developed and deployed by ICANN in a "RESTful" system since 2011 and is being used by the registries responsible for reverse DNS (rDNS) delegations underneath IN-ADDR.ARPA and IP6.ARPA through an HTTPS transaction that is mediated by an X.509 certificate.</t>
