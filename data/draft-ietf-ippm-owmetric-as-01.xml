      <t>Active traffic measurements are starting to become more widely used toascertain network performance characteristics. All active measurementsystems have the capability to measure one-way delay and one-way lossmetrics, as defined in RFC2679 [1] A One- way Delay Metric for IPPM andRFC 2680 [2] A One-way Packet Loss Metric for IPPM, respectively. Toensure that the resulting numbers have some meaning, we attempt tocharacterize how the measurements are taken and what would ensure thatthe end numbers are indeed meaningful. This document describes anapplicability statement (formerly known as best current practices) formeasuring the one-way delay and one-way loss metrics in operationalnetworks.</t>
