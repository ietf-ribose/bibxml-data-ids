      <t>Active traffic measurements are starting to become more widely used to ascertain network performance characteristics. All active measurement systems have the capability to measure one-way delay and one-way loss metrics, as defined in RFC2679 [1] A One- way Delay Metric for IPPM and RFC 2680 [2] A One-way Packet Loss Metric for IPPM, respectively. To ensure that the resulting numbers have some meaning, we attempt to characterize how the measurements are taken and what would ensure that the end numbers are indeed meaningful. This document describes an applicability statement (formerly known as best current practices) for measuring the one-way delay and one-way loss metrics in operational networks.</t>
