    <abstract>
      <t>The establishment of a shared model of trust is critical to any functioning technology ecosystem, particularly when it relates to the sharing of data and the execution of Consumer specific actions. Traditional models of trust have typically revolved around implicit trust established through bi-lateral arrangements (i.e. legal contracts) between participants. The issue with this approach is that, at scale, it is not possible for all participants to efficiently establish communication with all other participants. This leads to the requirement for a mechanism to establish trust across participants in a way that the business layer of an organisation has confidence in ensuring participant interaction is validated.</t>
