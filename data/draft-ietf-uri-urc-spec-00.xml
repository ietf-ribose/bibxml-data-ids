      <t>This document describes a Uniform Resource Characteristic, a method for encoding information about a given network resource. This information is called meta-information since it is not information that is actually found in the resource itself. The design of this Uniform Resource Characteristic was driven by the set of design requirements as specified in the 'Specification of Uniform Resource Characteristics' Internet draft [Mealling 94]. The method of encoding is based on the simple use of attribute/value pairs utilized in several existing network systems including RFC822 e-mail headers, IAFA templates, and the draft whois++ system [Deutsch 94]. In addition to the specification, several examples are provided which illustrate complex information encoding and actual client/server using whois++ as the protocol.</t>
