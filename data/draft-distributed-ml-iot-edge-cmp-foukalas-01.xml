      <t>Next generation Internet requires decentralized and distributed intelligence in order to make available a new type of experience to serve the user's interests. Such new services will be enabled by deploying the intelligence over a high volume of IoT devices in a form of distributed protocol. Such a protocol will orchestrate the machine learning (ML) application in order to train the aggregated data available from the IoT devices. The training is not an easy task in such a distributed environment, where the amount of connected IoT devices will scale up and the needs for both interoperability and computing are high. This draft, addresses both issues by combining two emerging technologies known as edge AI and fog computing. The protocol procedures aggregate the data collected by the IoT devices into a fog node and apply edge AI for data analysis at the edge of the infrastructure. The analysis of the IoT requirements resulted in an end-to-end ML protocol specification which is presented throughout this draft.</t>
