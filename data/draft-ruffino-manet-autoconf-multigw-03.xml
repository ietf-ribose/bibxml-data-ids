      <t>This document describes AMG, a mechanism for statelessautoconfiguration of IPv6 addresses for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks(MANETs), connected to the Internet by means of one or more gateways.Network prefixes are disseminated by Internet gateways and are usedby nodes to configure a set of global IPv6 addresses. An algorithmis specified, by which nodes can choose the optimal address for datatraffic. Configured global addresses are also advertised to otherMANET nodes, to minimize latencies in case of gateway failures, MANETpartitions and mergers. The specified mechanism aims to beindependent from any particular MANET routing protocol and toeffectively exploit multiple gateways.</t>
