      <t>NETCONF and YANG are pieces of an ambitious plan to improve networkmanagement. NETCONF gives access to native capabilities of thedevices within a network, defining methods for manipulatingconfiguration databases, retrieving operational data, and invokingspecific operations. YANG provides the means to define the contenttrafficked via NETCONF, both data and operations. Using bothtechnologies, the standards modules can be defined to giveinteroperability and commonality to devices, while still allowingdevices to express their unique capabilities.This document describes how NETCONF and YANG help build networkmanagement applications that meet the needs of network servicesproviders. An architecture is described which is friendly to bothdevices and applications, to vendors and standards bodies, to youngand to old, to red states and to blue states. It's a startlingvision, coming to networks near you starting August, 2009.</t>
