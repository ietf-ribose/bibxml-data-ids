      <t>This document introduces Virtual Service-aware Networks (VSNs) as asolution for inter-domain resource reservation with Quality-of-Service (QoS) on an Internet-wide scale. A VSN is a single-domainoverlay network that consists of guaranteed QoS pipes. VSNs ofneighboring domains that offer the same level of QoS establishpeering relationships. As such, they form a network of QoS-enablednetworks with a specific (QoS) routing context. In this network,admission control for traffic flows is performed in two phases. Thetwo-phase approach allows for the use of an off-path signalingprotocol, which enables the gradual introduction of thisarchitecture without changing the existing routers.</t>
