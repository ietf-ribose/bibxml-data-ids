      <t>This document introduces Virtual Service-aware Networks (VSNs) as a solution for inter-domain resource reservation with Quality-of- Service (QoS) on an Internet-wide scale. A VSN is a single-domain overlay network that consists of guaranteed QoS pipes. VSNs of neighboring domains that offer the same level of QoS establish peering relationships. As such, they form a network of QoS-enabled networks with a specific (QoS) routing context. In this network, admission control for traffic flows is performed in two phases. The two-phase approach allows for the use of an off-path signaling protocol, which enables the gradual introduction of this architecture without changing the existing routers.</t>
