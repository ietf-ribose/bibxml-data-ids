      <t>Seamless mobility requires preserving the capability, security, andquality of service offered to a mobile node during handoffs. Toachieve seamlessness, low (ideally no) latency and low (ideallyzero) packet loss handoff protocols are needed. Limiting the effectof handoffs has the potential to improve handoff performance interms of latency and packet loss. This draft identifies the problemarea for seamless mobility and defines the scope of the work for theSeaMoby work group.</t>
