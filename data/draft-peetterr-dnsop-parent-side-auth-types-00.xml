    <abstract>
      <t>A DNS RRtype numeric range that behaves like DS is reserved. This means: being authoritative on the parent side of a delegation; being signed by the parent; being provided along with delegations by the parent. If this document had become an RFC five years ago, deploying new types (along the lines of NS2/NS2T, DSPKI or various other imagined things like DNS ('signed delegation NS')) would be easier to deploy and experiment with today.</t>
