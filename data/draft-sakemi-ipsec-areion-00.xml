      <t>This document specifies the integration of the Areion cryptographic permutation into IPsec. Areion is a novel cryptographic primitive designed to achieve significantly lower latency for encryption and hashing operations compared to traditional algorithms like AES-GCM, making it particularly suitable for high-performance VPNs and data center interconnect scenarios. This specification defines the use of Areion within Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), including the associated keying materials and the necessary parameters for Internet Key Exchange (IKE). The Areion permutation is fully described in [I-D.sakemi-areion]. This document focuses on incorporating Areion into IPsec.</t>
