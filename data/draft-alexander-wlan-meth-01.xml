    <abstract>
      <t>This document provides a framework and methodology for performing stress testing and benchmarking of wireless LAN (WLAN) devices, including clients (i.e., host interfaces) and Access Points. The document defines and discusses a number of tests and associated test conditions that may be used to characterize the performance of such devices, and also supplies the methods used to calculate the results of these tests. This document also describes specific formats for reporting the results of the tests. It extends the methodology defined for benchmarking network interconnecting devices in RFC 2544 and LAN switches in RFC 2889 to IEEE 802.11 WLAN devices.</t>
