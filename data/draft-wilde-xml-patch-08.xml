      <t>The XML Patch media type "application/xml-patch+xml" defines an XML document structure for expressing a sequence of patch operations that are applied to an XML document. The XML Patch document format's foundations are defined in RFC 5261, this specification defines a document format and a media type registration, so that XML Patch documents can be labeled with a media type, for example in HTTP conversations. Note to Readers This draft should be discussed on the apps-discuss mailing list [1]. Online access to all versions and files is available on github [2].</t>
