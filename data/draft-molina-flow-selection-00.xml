      <t>Flow selection is the process of selecting only a limited number of flows out of all the flows observable/observed at an IPFIX device. The selection can be done in the metering process, by selectively accounting only some of the incoming packets, in the flow recording process, by keeping only some of the created flow records, or in the exporting process, by exporting only some of the flow records of the flow recording process. This document describes the scenarios where flow selection can be applied, discusses what information about the flow selection process is beneficial to export and provides an information model for it.</t>
