      <t>This document defines an IPv6 geo based global unicast address for- mat to use in the Internet. The address format is based on the 3GPP Universal Geographical Area Description. The address format defined in this document is consistent with the IPv6 protocol and the 'IPv6 Addressing Architecture'. It is designed to not only facilitate two dimensional data but also altitude information. This kind of information becomes necessary in areas where different users occupy floors (like in buildings) thus making plain geographical addressing ambiguous. In addition, provi- sion were made to extract valid location reference field data even in cases where accurarcy of location data was sacrified for a larg- er subnet field.</t>
