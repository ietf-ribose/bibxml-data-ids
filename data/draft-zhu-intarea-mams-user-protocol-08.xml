      <t>Today, a device can be simultaneously connected to multiple communication networks based on different technology implementations and network architectures like WiFi, LTE, and DSL. In such multi- connectivity scenario, it is desirable to combine multiple access networks or select the best one to improve quality of experience for a user and improve overall network utilization and efficiency. This document presents the u-plane protocols for a multi access management services (MAMS) framework that can be used to flexibly select the combination of uplink and downlink access and core network paths having the optimal performance, and user plane treatment for improving network utilization and efficiency and enhanced quality of experience for user applications.</t>
