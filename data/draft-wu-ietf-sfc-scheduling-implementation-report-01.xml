      <t>This document provides the application examples of mapping and deployment algorithms to address the problems of large resource overhead and end-to-end latency in Service Function Chain(SFC) that cannot meet the requirements of latency-sensitive applications in terms of both latency optimization and resource optimization.In terms of delay-optimized mapping and deployment of SFC, the application example of granularity-variable SFC mapping algorithm based on microservice architecture reduces the number of instantiated microservice units and the number of end-to-end routing hops by merging redundant microservice units within the service function chain and reusing microservice units between the service function chains.In terms of resource-optimized mapping and deployment of SFC, the application example of SFC mapping algorithm based on improved gray wolf optimization algorithm optimizes the mapping of SFC through two strategies of reverse learning initialization and nonlinear convergence factor, and improves the efficiency of the mapping scheme.</t>
