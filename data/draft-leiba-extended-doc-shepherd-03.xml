      <t>RFC 4858 talks about "Document Shepherding from Working Group Last Call to Publication". There's a significant part of a document's life that happens before working group last call, starting at the time that a working group begins discussing a version of the idea that's been posted as an individual draft. This document extends RFC 4858, discussing the potential for extending shepherding and what tasks might be involved throughout a working group document's lifecycle, from start to finish.</t>
