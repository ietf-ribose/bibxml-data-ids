      <t>This document describes the Generic Tunnel Tracing Protocol (GTTP).GTTP supports enhanced route-tracing applications. Network operatorsuse enhanced route-tracing applications to trace the path between anytwo points on an IP network. Enhanced route-tracing applications cantrace through a network's forwarding plane, its control plane orboth. Furthermore, enhanced route-tracing applications can revealdetails concerning tunnels that support the traced path. Tunneldetails can be revealed regardless of tunneling technology. Forexample, enhanced route-tracing applications can trace through anMPLS LSP as well as they can trace through an IP-in-IP tunnel.</t>
