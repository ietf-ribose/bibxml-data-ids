      <t>This document describes the Generic Tunnel Tracing Protocol (GTTP). GTTP supports enhanced route-tracing applications. Network operators use enhanced route-tracing applications to trace the path between any two points on an IP network. Enhanced route-tracing applications can trace through a network's forwarding plane, its control plane or both. Furthermore, enhanced route-tracing applications can reveal details concerning tunnels that support the traced path. Tunnel details can be revealed regardless of tunneling technology. For example, enhanced route-tracing applications can trace through an MPLS LSP as well as they can trace through an IP-in-IP tunnel.</t>
