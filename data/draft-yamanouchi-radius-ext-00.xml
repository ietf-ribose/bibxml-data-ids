      <t>This memo describes an extension of RADIUS authentication protocol (RFC2138) and RADIUS accounting protocol (RFC2139) to provide authentication service about multicast receivers and senders to the ingress and egress routers, and to keep track of the receiving and sending clients for multicast data feed service management. New services and attributes are added to the RADIUS definitions while the authentication transaction mechanisms are preserved. The authentication server authenticates the multicast receiver/sender by using the CHAP-based mechanism. The account server logs the start and stop points of multicast route usage. This extension is intended to be used in conjunction with the IGMP extension for multicast receiver and sender authentication.</t>
