      <t>This document attempts to describe a set of issues that arises fromthe desire to treat a set or group of names as "aliases" of eachother, "bundled," "variants," or "the same," which is problematic interms of corresponding behavior for DNS labels.With the emergence of internationalized domain names, among otherpotential use cases, two or more names that users will regard ashaving identical meaning will sometimes require correspondingbehavior in the DNS. It's not clear how to accommodate theserequirements for behavior of such names in DNS resolution; inparticular, it's not clear when they are best accommodated inregistry practices for generating names for lookup in the DNS,existing DNS protocol elements and behavior, or some set of protocolelements or behavior not yet defined. This document attempts todescribe some of these cases and the behavior of some of the possiblesolutions discussed to date.NOTE: Even more than usual, version -02 of this document is a "workin progress". Additional updates may be expected between the date ofthis document and the DNSEXT meeting in Beijing, and can be found athttp://users.isc.org/~woolf.</t>
