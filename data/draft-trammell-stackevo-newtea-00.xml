      <t>This document presently consists of a collection of unordered thoughts about new approaches to using encapsulation in support of stack evolution and new transport protocol deployment in an increasingly encrypted Internet. It aims eventually to enumerate a set of architectural assumptions for transport evolution based upon new encapsulations, and discuss limitations on the vocabulary used in each of these new interfaces necessary to achieve deployment</t>
