      <t>The IETF has developed many IP Mobility protocols, some of which have been successfully deployed. There has also been work done on enabling fast and efficient handovers at L3 and extensions to access control protocols to enable fast handovers. One aspect that has not been considered so far is the policies that a user is subjected to when accessing a subscribed network. These policies, defined by the network operator, have a significant impact on the user's mobility experience. This document aims to provide a discussion document on policy control and IP Mobility in controlled operator networks.</t>
