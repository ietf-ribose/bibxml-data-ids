    <abstract>
      <t>This draft proposes an experimental mechanism by which IPv6 link-local addresses and associated system names may be distributed among interconnected hosts, for use by users and applications. It provides an overview of the problem, a proposed solution (including suggested protocol details), and lists various related issues. This work is introduced to the IPng Working Group initially, although it might also have implications or concerns relevant to individuals working on directory services and other areas.</t>
