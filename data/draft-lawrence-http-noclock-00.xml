      <t>This memo describes a problem with the current Proposed Standard for HTTP/1.1 found as a result of implementation experience. A web server may be implemented in an embedded system as a network user interface. Often the embedded system is one which has no other use for a real-time clock, and/or the web interface is being added to an existing device which has no clock. Without a clock, no accurate HTTP Date header can be generated. This memo examines the implications of this situation for the operation of HTTP/1.1 origin servers, proxies, and clients, and proposes changes to the HTTP/1.1 specification to permit compliant operation in such systems.</t>
