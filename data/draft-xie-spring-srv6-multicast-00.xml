    <abstract>
      <t>Multicast was not originally supported with SR, as indicated in [RFC8402]: Segment Routing is defined for unicast. However, with the wide development and deployment of SR and SRv6 technology, there have been proposals to develop SR-based multicast solutions, showing the interests to develop multicast solutions that facilitate incremental deployment based on SR and SRv6. This document examines two typical SRv6 multicast approaches and considers a number of different aspects to provide a framework for understanding. The purpose is to help the working group and IETF community to understand and thus evaluate these possible impacts.</t>
