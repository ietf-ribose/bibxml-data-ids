    <abstract>
      <t>The documented semantics of HTTP 1.1 methods, in particular POST, are not well understood, as demonstrated by debates such as whether IPP should have used POST or a new method, how to properly bind SOAP to HTTP, and the ever more common use of POST for tunneling new protocols such as XML-RPC. This note attempts to define an abstract model for the state of HTTP URI scheme addressable resources consistent with HTTP 1.1, but hopefully more descriptive.</t>
