      <t>This draft introduces PSN independent overlay network (PION) architecture for intra- and inter-datacenter (DC) connections. The motivations, protocol layers, applications, and etc, for PION are also discussed. PION provides a virtualized underlying-PSN- independent network in order to maximize the reuse of IETF protocol definitions and implementations. The inter- and intra-DC connection provided by PION could be from endpoint to endpoint, or endpoint to network, or network to network. The packet transport capabilities provided by the overlay network are determined by the capability of the underlying PSN.</t>
