      <t>SIP lacks a mechanism to determine which domain can claim ownership of a certain telephone number. Due to this, it is impossible to establish meaningful identity or to authenticate endpoints that use telephone number URIs and domain names in their From address. This document proposes a solution to this problem using a return routability test.</t>
