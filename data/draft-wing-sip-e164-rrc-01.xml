      <t>SIP lacks a mechanism to determine which domain can claim ownershipof a certain telephone number. Due to this, it is impossible toestablish meaningful identity or to authenticate endpoints that usetelephone number URIs and domain names in their From address. Thisdocument proposes a solution to this problem using a returnroutability test.</t>
