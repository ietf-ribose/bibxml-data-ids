      <t>This document is a living document, meaning that during the life timme of the MPLS Open Design Team we will put additonal questions/ issues into the document. When we find an answer amd a way to document the issu it will be removed from this document. Ideally when the Design Team is closed this document will be empty, or maybe we just add a pointer to where the answer to quesstion is documented. Thus this document will never go on to become an RFCc.</t>
