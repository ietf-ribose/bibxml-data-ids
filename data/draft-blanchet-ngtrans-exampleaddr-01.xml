    <abstract>
      <t>To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion, an IPv6 prefix is reserved for use in examples in RFCs, books, documentation, and the like. Since site local addresses have special meaning in IPv6, these cannot be used in many example situations and are confusing. Instead, an IPv6 prefix 3ffe:ffff::/32 is reserved in the range of the test address space.</t>
