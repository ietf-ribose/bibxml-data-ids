      <t>To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion, an IPv6 prefix isreserved for use in examples in RFCs, books, documentation, and thelike. Since site local addresses have special meaning in IPv6, thesecannot be used in many example situations and are confusing.Instead, an IPv6 prefix 3ffe:ffff::/32 is reserved in the range ofthe test address space.</t>
