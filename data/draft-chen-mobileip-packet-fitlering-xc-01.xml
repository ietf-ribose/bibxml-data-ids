      <t>This document provides considerations for some requirements on the IPv6 nodes using MIPv6 to communicate with their peers across a network boundary where some specific packet filtering is deployed for operator and service provider controlled access to the services and network resources. Depending on the operational policies, the packet filtering can be applied on either the incoming packets or the outgoing packets or in both directions. A mobile node using MIPv6 sends packets with Home IP address in the extension headers, while the packet filtering is often based on either the source address or the destination address or both in the basic IPv6 header.Packet filtering that complies with the policies from the mobility unaware applications will fail to perform properly due to the change of the source and destination addresses in the basic IPv6 header when MIPv6 is used. This document provides an analysis on the operation requirements on packet filtering and then proposes a simple solution that does not impose any change on IPv6 but requires an addition to IPv6 nodes using MIPv6.</t>
