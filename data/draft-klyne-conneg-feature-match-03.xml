      <t>RFC 2533, 'A syntax for describing media feature sets', defines aformat to express media feature sets that represent media handlingcapabilities. It also describes an algorithm for matching thesefeature sets, which may be used, for example, to determine whetherthe capabilities of a sender and receiver are compatible.This memo describes a revised form of the feature set matchingalgorithm, which incorporates lessons learned while implementingthe original algorthm. It is anticipated that this revisedalgorithm description will be included in a future revision of RFC2533. This memo does not affect any of the normative content ofRFC 2533.</t>
