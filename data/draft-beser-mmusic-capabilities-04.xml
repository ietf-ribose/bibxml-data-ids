      <t>The need for assured communication arisen protocols like RSVP [2] and SBM [3] which are linked to access technologies to guarantee the delay and drop probabilities of a given IP flow. One of the side-effects of the assurance is that when the bandwidth of the IP flow goes outside the contracted region then the IP flow will be disturbed and the communication will be effected. This document discusses the effects of assured communication to SDP protocol, identifies the weaknesses and proposes a new attribute to rectify these weaknesses.</t>
