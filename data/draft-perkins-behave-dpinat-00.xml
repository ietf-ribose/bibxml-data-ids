      <t>SIPNAT has been proposed as an effective method for enabling globalInternet access to IPv6-only domains. New methods have been devisedfor accurate delivery of packets from the global Internet into theinternal domain of destinations that do not share a common addressspace with the majority of the global Internet. These improvementscan be used to augment Source-IP NAT so that perfect accuracy can beachieved in many common cases of interest.</t>
