    <abstract>
      <t>Session recording is a critical requirement in many business communications environments such as call centers and financial trading floors. In some of these environments, all calls must be recorded for regulatory and compliance reasons. In others, calls may be recorded for quality control or business analytics. Recording is typically done by sending a copy of the media to the recording devices. This document specifies requirements for a protocol that will manage delivery of media from an end-point that originates media or that has access to it to a recording device. This protocol is being referred to as Session Recording Protocol and will most likely be based on SIP.</t>
