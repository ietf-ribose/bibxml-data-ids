      <t>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides a convenient interface for obtaining route views by monitoring BGP sessions. BMP operates over TCP and is unidirectional (from client to server). QUIC provides multiple simultaneous streams to carry data in one direction, enabling much better efficiency and performance for both peers, in particular unidirectional streams can provide reverse data protection for the sender. QUIC also provides shorter handshake and includes TLS. This document describes how to use BMP over the QUIC transport protocol, named BMPoQUIC.</t>
