      <t>This document specifies two additions to the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). These additions (new Server commands) would give FTP Servers the ability to generate (or otherwise obtain) and return MD5 checksums for the files it has available for transfer. It is the author's belief that this would provide a great benefit to the Internet community, because it would allow automated transfer agents, as well as Web Browsers and other 'click-to-download' applications to be able to automatically verify the data of a downloaded file, and hence be able to detect any data tampering and/or corruption that may occurred while 'on the wire', or possibly while the file was on the Server (a virus infection).</t>
