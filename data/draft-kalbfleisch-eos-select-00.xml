      <t>Traditionally data retrieval from SNMP entities has been done usingGET, GETNEXT and the GETBULK PDU's. These mechanisms have worked wellfor some instances. However, there are many cases where they areinefficient in retrieving data that the management application needsto access. The EOS (Evolution of SNMP) Working Group is investigatingnew PDU's to be used to gather information from SNMP entities. Thismemo proposes a select PDU that will operate in much the same way asSQL Select.</t>
