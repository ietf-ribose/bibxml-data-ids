      <t>The original RObust Header Compression (ROHC) RFC, RFC 3095, defines a framework for header compression, along with compression protocols (profiles) for IP/UDP/RTP, IP/ESP, IP/UDP, and also for uncompressed packet streams. However, no profile was defined for compression of IP only, which has been identified as a flaw in RFC 3095. This document addresses that problem and defines a ROHC compression profile for IP, similar to the IP/UDP profile defined by RFC 3095, but simplified to exclude UDP.</t>
