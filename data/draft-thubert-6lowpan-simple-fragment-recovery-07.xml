      <t>Considering that the IPv6 minimum MTU is 1280 bytes and that an an802.15.4 frame can have a payload limited to 74 bytes in the worstcase, a packet might end up fragmented into as many as 18 fragmentsat the 6LoWPAN shim layer. If a single one of those fragments islost in transmission, all fragments must be resent, furthercontributing to the congestion that might have caused the initialpacket loss. This draft introduces a simple protocol to forward andrecover individual fragments that might be lost over multiple hopsbetween 6LoWPAN endpoints.</t>
