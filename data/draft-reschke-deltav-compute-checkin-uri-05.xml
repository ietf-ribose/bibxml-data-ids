      <t>In many cases, a versioning-aware client might want to display/include the URI of the version it's editing while it's being edited.For instance, an editor might include this as meta information, orthe author of a document might want to know the URI of the versionbefore it's checked in. A well-known example is the W3C way ofreferring to document versions in recommendations: it containsreferences to 'the current version', to 'this version' and to the'previous version'. Something like this is currently impossible withWebDAV versioning [RFC3253], as the version URI is determined at thetime of CHECKIN.Distribution of this document is unlimited.
