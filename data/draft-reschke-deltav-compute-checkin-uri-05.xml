      <t>In many cases, a versioning-aware client might want to display/ include the URI of the version it's editing while it's being edited. For instance, an editor might include this as meta information, or the author of a document might want to know the URI of the version before it's checked in. A well-known example is the W3C way of referring to document versions in recommendations: it contains references to 'the current version', to 'this version' and to the 'previous version'. Something like this is currently impossible with WebDAV versioning [RFC3253], as the version URI is determined at the time of CHECKIN. Distribution of this document is unlimited. Please send comments to the WebDAV versioning (delta-V) mailing list at ietf-dav-versioning@w3.org [1], which may be joined by sending a message with subject 'subscribe' to ietf-dav-versioning-request@w3.org [2]. Discussions of the delta-V mailing list are archived at URL: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/ Public/ietf-dav-versioning/.</t>
