      <t>This draft describes a profile for compressing RTP/IP using the Robust Header Compression Formal Notation. The RObust Header Compression [1] scheme is designed to compress packet headers over error prone channels. It is built around an extensible core framework that can be tailored to compress new protocol stacks by adding additional ROHC profiles. This draft describes a modification of previously published RTP profiles for ROHC to conform to ROHC-FN [2] and Prolog.</t>
