      <t>Members in a secure group may need to communicate to the GCKS toDeregister from the group, for SA resynchronization, or to requestretransmission of a Rekey message. A simple solution is to keep theregistration SA around, but that comes at the expense of O(n) SAmaintenance, and storage at the GCKS. Each member is also responsiblefor maintaining an extra SA. We propose an efficient method for mem-bers to securely send messages to the GCKS, using the Rekey SA.</t>
