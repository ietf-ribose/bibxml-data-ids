    <abstract>
      <t>This document specifies rules for email addresses that are flexible enough to express the addresses typically used with SMTPUTF8, while avoiding confusing or risky elements. NOTE: The term 'nice' is not ideal here, and must be reconsidered or replaced before this is issued as an RFC. "Well-formed" is a candidate. "Nice" will do for now: better to argue about substance than wording.</t>
