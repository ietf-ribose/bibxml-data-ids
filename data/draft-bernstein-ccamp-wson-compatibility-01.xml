      <t>While the current GMPLS WSON framework can deal with many types ofwavelength switching systems there is a desire to extend the controlplane to networks that include a combination of transparent opticaland hybrid electro optical systems such as OEO switches,regenerators, and wavelength converters. Such networks are frequentlyreferred to as translucent optical networks in the literature. Someof the systems use in such networks can be limited to processing WSONsignals with specific characteristics or attributes. In addition,some of the network elements may be able to perform importantoptional processing functions such as regeneration on a signal andwould need to be provisioned as part of optical path establishment.This document provides a WSON signal definition and attributescharacterization based on ITU-T interface and signal class standardsand describes the signal compatibility constraints of this extendedset of network elements. The signal characterization, network elementcompatibility constraints and enhanced provisioning support enableGMPLS routing and signaling to control these devices and PCE tocompute optical light-paths subject to signal compatibilityattributes.</t>
