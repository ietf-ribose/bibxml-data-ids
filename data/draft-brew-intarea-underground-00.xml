      <t>When users are at known undergroudn locations, such as tube stationsthey often do not have a GPS signal, as the radio waves from thesatellites required cannot penetrate the earth, this draft suggestsproviding GPS locations over WiFI using remote IP detection for aserver to respond with the correct name of clients location andthe clients GPS location.Extending this to those without WifI access the standard goes onestage further, by offering a hidden wifi network with a standard name,such as .location. The principle being that mobile devices canlook for this network in cases where GPS data cannot be collected. Itis hoped that this will allow those using mapping services to knowwhere they are when travelling on underground trains etc.</t>
