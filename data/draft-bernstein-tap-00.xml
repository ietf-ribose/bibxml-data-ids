      <t>It is common for Internet hosts to associate a relatively long-lived identifier, commonly a 'username' or 'owner name,' to each TCP connection. TAP announces the identifier associated with a particular TCP connection to the host on the other end of the connection. TAP may be used on any host which associates a relatively long-lived identifier to each connection.</t>
