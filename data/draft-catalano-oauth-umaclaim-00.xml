      <t>User-Managed Access (UMA) is a profile of OAuth 2.0. UMA defines how resource owners can control protected-resource access by clients operated by arbitrary requesting parties, where the resources reside on any number of resource servers, and where a centralized authorization server governs access based on resource owner policy. This specification defines a generic framework for building UMA claim profiles that can be used by client applications to obtain the necessary authorization to access protected resources. This revision of the specification is part of V0.9.</t>
