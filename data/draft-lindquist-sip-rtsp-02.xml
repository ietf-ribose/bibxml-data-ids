      <t>The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is widely used for establishingmultimedia sessions, whereas the Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP)is used in streaming media systems. RTSP has a dual role: itestablishes a media session for the delivery of streaming media aswell as controls the streaming session once it has been set up.Since SIP is also used for session establishment, there exists anoverlap between the functionality provided by SIP and RTSP. In thisdocument, we describe a model adopted by ETSI TISPAN, 3GPP, and OpenIPTV Forum (OIPF) in which SIP and the SDP offer/answer model areused to set up a streaming session with an RTSP control channel andone or more media delivery streams. Such a model is beneficial sinceit allows the reuse of current architecture and functionality (e.g.,authentication, charging, and QoS) established around SIP for RTSP-based streaming. The model benefits applications such as InternetProtocol Television (IPTV). In addition to the model, the documentspecifies two new variants of RTSP.</t>
