      <t>This document specifies RTP/I, an application level real-timeprotocol for distributed interactive media. Typical examples ofdistributed interactive media are shared whiteboards, networkedcomputer games and distributed virtual environments. RTP/I definesa standardized framing for the transmission of data and providesmechanisms that are universally needed for this media class.Thereby RTP/I enables the development of reusable functionality andgeneric services that can be employed for multiple distributedinteractive media. Examples for this kind of functionality are theability to record sessions, to support late coming participants,and to provide security services. RTP/I is a protocol that followsthe ideas of application level framing and integrated layerprocessing. It has been designed to be independent of theunderlying network and transport layers. To a large extend RTP/Ihas been inspired by the real-time transport protocol (RTP), whichis used for continuous non-interactive media.This document is intended to stimulate the discussion on how totransport distributed interactive media over the Internet. Thereexists an RTP/I mailing list. Instructions on how to subscribe tothis list can be found at the RTP/I homepage(http://www.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/informatik/pi4/projects/RTPI/index.html). Feedback on this document should be addressed to the RTP/I mailing list or directly to the authors.</t>
