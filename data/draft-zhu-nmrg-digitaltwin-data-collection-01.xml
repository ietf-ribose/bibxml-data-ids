      <t>Digital Twin Network is a network system with Physical Network and Twin Network, which can be mapped interactively in real time. The construction of Digital Twin Network requires real-time data of Physical Network to update the state of Twin Network. However the existing method collects the full amount of data from the Physical Network for modeling, and does not consider the problems such as time-lag, insufficient storage resources, low computational efficiency and waste of bandwidth resources. This document introduces an efficient data collection, aggregation and correlation method in which the Twin Network sends instructions to the Physical Network to collect data on demand, and then the Physical Network completes instructions such as knowledge representation, Telemetry Streaming Element of Physical Network completes data aggregation and correlation. Finally Telemetry Streaming Element sends the processed data to the Twin Network.</t>
