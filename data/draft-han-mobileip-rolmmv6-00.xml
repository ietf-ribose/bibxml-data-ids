      <t>Using localized mobility management based on IPv6, all packets destined to a mobile node are routed through the local mobility agent in the mobile node's local mobility domain, which then tunnels the packets to the mobile node's current location. Such packet routing mechanism is similar to the triangle routing in Mobile IPv4, which may leave the local mobility agent overloaded and take a longer route thus increasing the network traffic in the local mobility domain. This document specifies a route optimization scheme for localized mobility management based on IPv6 with the help of L2 trigger. Using this, correspondent nodes can cache LCoA of a mobile node if it is actively communicating with the mobile node, and then send their packets for the mobile node directly to the LCoA, bypassing the local mobility agent. This route optimization scheme will result in more efficient localized mobility management. It alleviates the local mobility agent's loads and takes the nearly same handoff delay time as the one in localized mobility management based on IPv6.</t>
