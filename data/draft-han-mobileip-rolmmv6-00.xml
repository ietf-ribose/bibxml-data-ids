      <t>Using localized mobility management based on IPv6, all packetsdestined to a mobile node are routed through the local mobilityagent in the mobile node's local mobility domain, which thentunnels the packets to the mobile node's current location. Suchpacket routing mechanism is similar to the triangle routing inMobile IPv4, which may leave the local mobility agent overloadedand take a longer route thus increasing the network traffic in thelocal mobility domain. This document specifies a route optimizationscheme for localized mobility management based on IPv6 with thehelp of L2 trigger. Using this, correspondent nodes can cache LCoAof a mobile node if it is actively communicating with the mobilenode, and then send their packets for the mobile node directly tothe LCoA, bypassing the local mobility agent. This routeoptimization scheme will result in more efficient localizedmobility management. It alleviates the local mobility agent's loadsand takes the nearly same handoff delay time as the one inlocalized mobility management based on IPv6.</t>
