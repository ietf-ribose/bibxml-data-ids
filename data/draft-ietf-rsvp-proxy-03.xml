    <abstract>
      <t>RSVP has been extended in several directions [POLICY], [RSVP-APPID],[DCLASS], [AGGRRSVP], [RSVPDIFF]. These extensions have broadened theapplicability of RSVP characterizing it as a signaling protocolusable both inside and outside the Integrated Services [INTSERV]model.With the addition of the 'Null Service Type' [NULLSERV], RSVP isalso being adopted by mission critical applications that require someform of prioritized service, but cannot quantify their resourcerequirements. In cases where RSVP cannot travel end-to-end, theseapplications may still benefit from reservations that are not trulyend-to-end, but that are 'proxied' by a network node on the data pathbetween the sender and the receiver(s). RSVP Receiver Proxy is an extension to the RSVP message processing(not to the protocol itself) in which an intermediate network nodeoriginates the Resv message on behalf of the receiver(s) identifiedby the Path message.</t>
