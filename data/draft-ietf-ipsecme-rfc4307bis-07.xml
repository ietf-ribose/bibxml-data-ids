      <t>The IPsec series of protocols makes use of various cryptographic algorithms in order to provide security services. The Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol is used to negotiate the IPsec Security Association (IPsec SA) parameters, such as which algorithms should be used. To ensure interoperability between different implementations, it is necessary to specify a set of algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all implementations support. This document defines the current algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance for IKEv2. This document does not update the algorithms used for packet encryption using IPsec Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP).</t>
