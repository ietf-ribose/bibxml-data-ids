      <t>This draft consider Path MTU (PMTU) alogorithms and issues in QUIC applications. Fistly, a passive probing approach is adopted to discover the PMTU. The process of discovering the PMTU is not performed separately, but is performed simultaneously in the actual application data communication. A probe packet is defined newly using 1-RTT packet which includes actual application data as well as a short packet header and a PING_EXT frame. Until the optimal PMTU is discovered, the size of the probe packet is changed according to the size of the PMTU candidate. Secondly, a PMTU black hole problem in secure and reliable transport protocol is discussed and a possible solution can be suggested from existing researches. Thirdly, PMTU issues for media delivery over UDP, such as WebRTC and media over QUIC (MoQ) are discussed.</t>
