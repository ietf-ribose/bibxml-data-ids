      <t>With the widespread adoption of post-quantum cryptography will come the need for an entity to possess multiple public keys on different cryptographic algorithms. Since the trustworthiness of individual post-quantum algorithms is at question, a multi-key cryptographic operation will need to be performed in such a way that breaking it requires breaking each of the component algorithms individually. This requires defining new structures for holding composite encryption data. This document defines a content encryption process following the hybrid model as described in the NIST Post-Quantum Crypto FAQ. This draft defines three composite encryption modes. First, Composite Key Transport using Encryption primitives which encrypts a message (typically a content encryption key) for a recipient with a composite public key composed entirely of encryption keys by encrypting it with multiple one-time-pad keys, each encrypted under a different recipient public key. Second, Composite Key Transport using Encryption and KEM primitives is the generalization of the previous mode to support a mixture of encryption and KEM algorithms. Third, Composite Key Exchange is the most general and supports establishing a shared secret using any combination of encryption, KEM, and key exchange primitives where a master shared secret is generated using NIST SP 800-56Cr2.</t>
