      <t>This memo presents a method for annotating XML schemas expressed in the RELAX NG language and transforming them to a form suitable for direct inclusion in an XML source of an I-D or RFC. The XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) stylesheet performing the transformation also automatically generates cross- references between RELAX NG pattern definitions and their references.</t>
