      <t>The DCLASS object is proposed in [DCLASS] to represent and carry Differentiated Services Code Points (DSCPs) within RSVP messages. Theprinciple use of the DCLASS object is to carry DSCP informationbetween a DS network and upstream nodes that may wish to mark packetswith DSCP values. A network element in the DS network determines thevalue for DSCP which is further carried as a DCLASS object in RSVP RESV message to the sender host. The RSVP capability negotiation CAPObject [RSVP_CAP] is proposed to convey end host/upstream node Capabilities to the downstream network.</t>
