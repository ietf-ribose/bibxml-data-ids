      <t>Many Diameter applications require to classify packets. Diameterbase protocols provides an IP Filter Rule type and a QoS Filter Ruletype that is being used to classify packets. However, because thesetypes were defined for specific uses and defined in ways that arehard to extend and therefore are not generally applicable for thoseapplications that require packet classifiers.This document describes a set of Diameter types that are useful tocreate packet classifiers. The packet classier type can be used byvarious applications to express packet classifiers that best matchthe application's specific needs.</t>
