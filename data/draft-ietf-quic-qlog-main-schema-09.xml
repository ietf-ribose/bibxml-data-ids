    <abstract>
      <t>qlog provides extensible structured logging for network protocols, allowing for easy sharing of data that benefits common debug and analysis methods and tooling. This document describes key concepts of qlog: formats, files, traces, events, and extension points. This definition includes the high-level log file schemas, and generic event schemas. Requirements and guidelines for creating protocol- specific event schemas are also presented. All schemas are defined independent of serialization format, allowing logs to be represented in various ways such as JSON, CSV, or protobuf.
