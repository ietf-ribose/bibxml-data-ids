    <abstract>
      <t>One feature of the Service Location Protocol is that Services may be assigned a Service Specific Multicast address to aid in service discovery. Use of this address for service discovery will not burden systems which do not advertise the service type. Two open questions are answered in the following proposal: How are the multicast addresses to be assigned? How are these multicast addresses known by SLP Service and User Agents?</t>
