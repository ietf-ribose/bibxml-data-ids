      <t>This document specifies how flow mobility can be realized for amobile node with multiple network interfaces, for which the networkprovides mobility support by means of Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). Byintroducing a "Primary Prefix", the mobile node is able to maintainIP data sessions when moving between different network interfaces.This document introduces a new set of ICMP and Mobility Headermessages. It requires modifications of the mobile node. However,since support for simultaneous multi-access and flow mobilityrequires modifications of the mobile node anyway, the modificationssuggested in this document are considered to be modest.The suggested enhancement is fully backwards compatible with the baseProxy Mobile IPv6 specification. The mobile node may be an IPv4-onlynode, IPv6-only node, or a dual-stack node.</t>
