    <abstract>
      <t>This document describes the use of TLS to provide privacy for DNS. Encryption provided by TLS eliminates opportunities for eavesdropping and on-path tampering with DNS queries in the network, such as discussed in RFC 7258. In addition, this document specifies two usage profiles for DNS-over-TLS and provides advice on performance considerations to minimize overhead from using TCP and TLS with DNS. Note: this document was formerly named draft-ietf-dprive-start-tls-for-dns. Its name has been changed to better describe the mechanism now used. Please refer to working group archives under the former name for history and previous discussion. [RFC Editor: please remove this paragraph prior to publication]</t>
