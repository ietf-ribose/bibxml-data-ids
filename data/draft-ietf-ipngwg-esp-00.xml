      <t>This memo describes the IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). ESP seeks to provide integrity and confidentiality to IPv6 datagrams. It may also provide authentication, depending on which algorithm and algorithm mode are used. Non-repudiation and protection from traffic analysis are not provided by ESP. The IPv6 Authentication Header (AH) might provide non-repudiation if used with certain authentication algorithms. The IPv6 Authentication Header may be used in conjunction with ESP to provide authentication. Users desiring integrity and authentication without confidentiality should use the IPv6 Authentication Header (AH) instead of ESP. This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the related document 'IPv6 Security Architecture', which defines the overall security architecture for IPv6 and provides important background for this specification.</t>
