      <t>This document provides an analysis and identification of the managed objects for dynamic configuration of middleboxes. The scope of the middleboxes to which these managed objects apply is limited to NATs and Firewalls. However, the managed objects as identified in this document are intended to provide a baseline for the dynamic configuration of other types of middleboxes. The applicability of existing Management Information Base (MIB) modules to the MIDCOM requirements, framework and semantics is described. Additional managed objects are identified to satisfy the entirety of the MIDCOM requirements, framework and semantics and to provide a complete MIDCOM MIB for NATs and Firewalls to fully realize the requirements of the MIDCOM protocol. The actual definition of any new managed objects is provided in a separate document [MDCMIB].</t>
