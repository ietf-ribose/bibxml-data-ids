      <t>Network devices are incorporating capabilities for time stamping certain packets so that such time stamps can reference the time at which a packet passes through a given device (at ingress or egress). Those stamps or marks are relevant to calculating the measured delay and can be used for traffic engineering purposes. To ensure consistency and accuracy across different network element implementations, a benchmarking procedure is necessary to calibrate the timestamps. Such a procedure can permit the identification and correction of any deviations or biases in the time stamps produced by diverse devices. This document proposes a methodology for Calibrating the measurements from different network element implementations in a common measurement scenario.</t>
