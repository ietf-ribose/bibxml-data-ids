    <abstract>
      <t>VoIP typically uses the encapsulation voice/RTP/UDP/IP. When MPLS labels are added, this becomes voice/RTP/UDP/IP/MPLS-labels. For an MPLS VPN, the packet header is at least 48 bytes, while the voice payload is often no more than 30 bytes, for example. VoIP header compression can significantly reduce the VoIP overhead through various compression mechanisms, such as enhanced compressed RTP (ECRTP). We consider using MPLS to route ECRTP compressed packets over an MPLS LSP without compression/decompression cycles at each router. Such an ECRTP over MPLS capability can increase the bandwidth efficiency as well as processing scalability of the maximum number of simultaneous VoIP flows that use header compression at each router.</t>
