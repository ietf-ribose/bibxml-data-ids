      <t>This memo defines a framework for allowing asynchronous communication between sleepy sensors mediated by a supporting Proxy node. The Proxy acts as a store-and-forward agent that handles requests on behalf of a sleepy client, and buffers responses coming from the target origin until the requesting client wakes up and get the computation results. A new CoAP option, Sleepy, is defined to initiate and control the asynchronous exchange.</t>
