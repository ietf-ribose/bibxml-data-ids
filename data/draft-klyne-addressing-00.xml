      <t>This memo is a critique of Internet e-mail addressing, with particular reference to its suitability for use in a general purpose interpersonal communication medium as opposed to its present use largely within a restricted community. The critique focusses on the differences between e-mail addresses and other forms of addressing with which very many lay people are intimately familiar. This memo does not offer any solutions to the issues raised; rather it is hoped to provoke some debate on the matter. The author would be particularly interested in views from those whose natural language does not use the Roman (western) alphabet.</t>
