      <t>This document defines Access Router Information Protocol (ARIP)whereby a mobile host can improve the handoff performance byexchanging, in advance, the information among geographicallyadjacent access router(AR)s. This protocol does not need a certainassumption of network topology so that it can be applied toheterogeneous networks as well as homogeneous networks. This documentalso describes a framework to minimize the handoff latency with theaid of ARIP. Therefore, ARIP can be combined with the protocol such asFast Handovers (for Mobile IPv6) which tries to minimize the handofflatency.</t>
