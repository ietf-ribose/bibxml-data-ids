      <t>We introduce a new class of model based Internet metrics designed to determine if a long path can be expected to meet a predefined end-to- end application performance target by applying a suite of single property tests to successive sections of the long path. In many cases these single property tests are based on existing IPPM metrics, with the addition of success and validity criteria. The sub-path at a time tests are designed to eliminate all known conditions that might prevent the full path from meeting the target performance.</t>
