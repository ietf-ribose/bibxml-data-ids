    <abstract>
      <t>Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are typically characterized by high latency and lack of constant end to end connectivity, consistent with their use in deep space communications. This, however, is not the limit of application of Bundle Protocol (BP) and related DTN enabling technologies. Through a collection of Convergance Layer Adapters (CLAs), deployment overlaying the terrestrial Internet is a core component of DTN implementations. IPN is a integer based naming scheme for DTN networks. Notwithstanding cryptographic considerations, three basic components are necessary to enable a BP node to use the underlying Internet to communicate with another BP node: the IP address of the node, the CBHE Node Number (component of any ipn-scheme URI identifying a BP endpoint of which that node is a member), and the CLA which provides IP connectivity to that node. This document describes RRTYPE additions to DNS to enable terrestrial BP resource look-up.</t>
