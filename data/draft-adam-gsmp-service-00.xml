      <t>The basic set of ATM switch services useful for streaming media such as video and audio are virtual circuit segments, virtual path segments, and multicast segments with quality of service support. These services are specified using the concept of traffic classes. A definition of traffic classes different from that used by other bodies is provided here. The present Internet Draft is based on the corresponding set of services that are being considered by the IEEE P1520 working group.</t>
