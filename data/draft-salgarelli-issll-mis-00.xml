    <abstract>
      <t>This memo presents an integrated, server-based mechanism for the efficient support of the IP Integrated Services (IIS) model in ATM networks, namely the Multicast Integration Server (MIS) architecture. Instead of viewing IP-ATM multicast address resolution and QoS support separately, the approach in this memo is to consider such issues in an integrated manner. In particular, the MIS architecture defines how a layer-3 setup protocol as RSVP can be mapped to and integrated with a layer-2 multicast address resolution protocol as EARTH - EAsy Multicast Routing THrough ATM clouds. With the use of EARTH, several ATM point-to-multipoint connections with different QoS parameters can be associated to a single IP multicast address. An RSVP server (RSVP-S) within the MIS is used to distribute RSVP messages inside the ATM cloud and to set the corresponding QoS state in the address resolution table of EARTH (setup protocol mapping). In addition, this memo defines a quantized heterogeneity model which supports, together with the MIS, advanced IIS features as QoS heterogeneity and dynamic QoS changes in IP-ATM networks.</t>
