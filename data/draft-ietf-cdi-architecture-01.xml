      <t>There is wide interest in the technology for interconnecting ContentNetworks, variously called 'Content Peering' or 'ContentInternetworking'. We present the general architecture and corebuilding blocks used in the internetworking of Content Networks. Thescope of this work is limited to external interconnections withContent Networks and does not address internal mechanisms used withinContent Networks, which for the purpose of the document areconsidered to be black boxes. This work establishes an abstractarchitectural framework to be used in the development of protocols,interfaces, and system models for standardized ContentInternetworking.</t>
