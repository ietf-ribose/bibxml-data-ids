    <abstract>
      <t>The IETF Standards Track solution for MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS- TP) Linear Protection is provided in RFC 6378, draft-ietf-mpls-psc- updates and draft-ietf-mpls-tp-psc-itu. This document describes the pre-standard implementation of MPLS-TP Linear Protection that has been deployed by several network operators using equipment from multiple vendors. At the time of publication these pre-standard implementations were still in operation carrying live traffic. The specified mechanism supports 1+1 unidirectional/bidirectional protection switching and 1:1 bidirectional protection switching. It is purely supported by MPLS-TP data plane, and can work without any control plane.
