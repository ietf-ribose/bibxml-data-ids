      <t>This document specifies Early Compression Enabler for ROHC-TCP to increase compression gain. The enabler provides a generic platform to implement an early compression mechanism. An early compression mechanism is an out-of-band mechanism that populates the ROHC-TCP decompression context with some of the header fields before the ROHC- TCP initialization step. ROHC-TCP does not need to carry those fields, thus early compression provides compression from the very first TCP packet and increases the compression gain. It is especially useful for short-lived TCP connections. The document describes the working of Early Compression Enabler as part of ROHC-TCP. It also specifies protocol changes for the ROHC-TCP protocol. It does not specify any particular early compression mechanism.</t>
