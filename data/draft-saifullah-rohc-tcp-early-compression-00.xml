      <t>This document specifies Early Compression Enabler for ROHC-TCP toincrease compression gain. The enabler provides a generic platform toimplement an early compression mechanism. An early compressionmechanism is an out-of-band mechanism that populates the ROHC-TCPdecompression context with some of the header fields before the ROHC-TCP initialization step. ROHC-TCP does not need to carry thosefields, thus early compression provides compression from the veryfirst TCP packet and increases the compression gain. It is especiallyuseful for short-lived TCP connections. The document describes theworking of Early Compression Enabler as part of ROHC-TCP. It alsospecifies protocol changes for the ROHC-TCP protocol. It does notspecify any particular early compression mechanism.</t>
