      <t>The encapsulation of IP packet headers in tunnels is used in many places, including IPsec and IP in IP [RFC2003]. Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is an experimental addition to the IP architecture that uses the ECN field in the IP header to provide an indication of the onset of congestion to applications. ECN provides this congestion indication to enable end-node adaptation to network conditions without the use of dropped packets [RFC 2481]. Currently, the ECN specification does not accommodate the constraints imposed by with some of these pre-existing specifications for tunnels. This document considers issues related to interactions between ECN and IP tunnels, and proposes two alternative solutions.</t>
