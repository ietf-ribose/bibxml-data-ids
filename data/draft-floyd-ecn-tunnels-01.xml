      <t>The encapsulation of IP packet headers in tunnels is used in manyplaces, including IPsec and IP in IP [RFC2003]. Explicit CongestionNotification (ECN) is an experimental addition to the IP architecturethat uses the ECN field in the IP header to provide an indication ofthe onset of congestion to applications. ECN provides thiscongestion indication to enable end-node adaptation to networkconditions without the use of dropped packets [RFC 2481]. Currently,the ECN specification does not accommodate the constraints imposed bywith some of these pre-existing specifications for tunnels. Thisdocument considers issues related to interactions between ECN and IPtunnels, and proposes two alternative solutions.</t>
