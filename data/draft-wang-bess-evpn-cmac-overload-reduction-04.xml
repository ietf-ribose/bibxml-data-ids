      <t>When PBB EVPN [RFC7623] is used in Segment Routing networks, it is complicated to make use of the SID list to carry a function that is aiming for C-MACs. In [I-D.ietf-spring-srv6-network-programming], End.DX2 function is defined, this function can be used in EVPN VPLS. When it is used in EVPN VPLS, the data-plane learning defined in End.DT2U function can also be activated for End.DX2 function. On the basis of such End.DX2 function, SRv6 EVPN can meet all the requirements per [RFC7623] and bring us some other benefits. Such SRv6 EVPN is called light- weighted SRv6 EVPN, and it will be more simpler than PBB EVPN over SRv6. It is easy for the light-weighted SRv6 EVPN to carry a SID that is aiming for customer ethernet packets, because there will be no other ethernet header between the SID list and the customer ethernet header. These SIDs may be user-defined functions for the customer ethernet headers.</t>
