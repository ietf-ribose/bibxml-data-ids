      <t>Air/land/sea/space mobile nodes (e.g., aircraft of various configurations, terrestrial vehicles, seagoing vessels, space systems, enterprise wireless devices, pedestrians with cell phones, etc.) communicate with networked correspondents over wireless and/or wired-line data links and configure mobile routers to connect end user networks. This document presents a multilink virtual interface specification that enables mobile nodes to coordinate with a network- based mobility service, fixed node correspondents and/or other mobile node peers. The virtual interface provides an adaptation layer service suited for both mobile and more static environments such as enterprise and home networks. Both Provider-Aggregated (PA) and Provider-Independent (PI) addressing services are supported. This document specifies the transmission of IP packets over Overlay Multilink Network (OMNI) Interfaces.</t>
