      <t>This specification defines extensions to Mobile IPv4 protocol forallowing a mobile node with multiple interfaces to register a care-ofaddress for each of its network interfaces and to simultaneouslyestablish multiple Mobile IP tunnels with its home agent. Thisessentially allows the mobile node to utilize all the availablenetwork interfaces and build an higher aggregated data pipe with thehome agent for its home address traffic. Furthermore, theseextensions also allow the mobile node and the home agent to negotiateflow policies for binding individual traffic flows with theregistered care-of addresses.</t>
