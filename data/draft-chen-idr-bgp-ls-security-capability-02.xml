    <abstract>
      <t>As users' traffic faces more unpredictable attacks during transmission, there are more and more end-users now need high security data transmission guarantee, they need ISPs to provide security protection capabilities on the data forwarding path. Therefore, ISPs need to have real-time awareness of the security capabilities available in the network, then form a security capability map, finally provide security protection for users at the routing level. The goal of this draft is to collect the security capabilities of nodes, which will be one of the factors to form the routing topology, and use the routing programming capabilities to form a secure routing path. The BGP-LS protocol is extended to carry the security capabilities of the node. The controller collects topology information, forms a topology path with security capabilities according to security requirements, and supports SRv6 path sending to execute node forwarding through programming.</t>
