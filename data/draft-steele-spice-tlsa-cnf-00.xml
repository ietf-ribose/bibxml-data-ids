      <t>Digital Crededentials on the Internet often JSON Web Token (JWT) and CBOR Web Token (CWT), which depends on third parties to certify the keys used. This document improves on that situation by enabling the administrators of domain names to specify the keys used in that domain's digital credentials. This is accomplished by describing how to discover thumbprints for proof-of-possession keys, as described in RFC 7800 and RFC 8747, using TLSA Records as described in RFC 6698. This approach can be leveraged to develop revocation and assurance capabilities for digital credentials.</t>
