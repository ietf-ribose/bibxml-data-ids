    <abstract>
      <t>Outbound IP spoofing, where attackers send packets with forged source IP addresses, poses a significant threat to Internet security. Measuring the deployment of outbound source address validation (OSAV) is critical for characterizing the vulnerability to outbound IP spoofing across the global Internet. Remote measurement of OSAV deployment offers a practical method for measuring numerous Autonomous Systems (ASes) efficiently. This document presents a method for remotely measuring the deployment status of OSAV, without cooperations from volunteers in remote networks.</t>
