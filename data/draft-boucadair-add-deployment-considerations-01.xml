    <abstract>
      <t>The document discusses some deployment considerations of the various options to discover encrypted DNS resolvers (e.g., DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS, or DNS-over-QUIC). Particularly, this document is meant to exemplify how Discovery of Network-designated Resolvers (DNR) and Discovery of Designated Resolvers (DDR) can be used in typical deployment contexts. Also, the document includes considerations related to hosting a DNS forwarder in local networks.</t>
